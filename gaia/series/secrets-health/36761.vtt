>> Mike Adams: Welcome
to Secrets

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:90%
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.902 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mike Adams the
editor of Natural News .

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Edward Group: And
I'm Ed Group the owner

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.304 align:middle line:90%
of Global Healing Center.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And today's topic is
the hidden dangers of radiation.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:44.078 align:middle line:84%
But we're not talking about EMF
radiation or electro pollution;

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:46.514 align:middle line:84%
this is ionizing
radiation right Ed?

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, you know
Mike this is the silent type

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:84%
of radiation, this is
the kind of radiation

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
that you don't even feel

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:84%
and honestly you don't even
hear that much about it.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're talking
about ionizing radiation

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.629 align:middle line:84%
and really we're going
to start off with talking

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:84%
about the situation
at Fukushima.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.768 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's it's just an
ongoing thing right now what are

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:08.802 align:middle line:90%
you hearing with that?

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well, absolutely,

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.607 align:middle line:84%
Fukushima is definitely
a bigger nuclear disaster

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:17.878 align:middle line:84%
than Chernobyl was you know in
the 1980s and yet there's a lot

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.981 align:middle line:84%
of denial about it right now in
the mainstream media probably

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.151 align:middle line:84%
because that nuclear plant
was designed and built

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.055 align:middle line:84%
by a US company so you don't
hear the same kind of criticism

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.291 align:middle line:84%
in the US media that
you were hearing

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:33.294 align:middle line:84%
about the Russian built
nuclear plant in Chernobyl.

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:36.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's just
a really sad situation

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:38.998 align:middle line:84%
because we have literally
the Pacific Ocean,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.701 align:middle line:90%
we have three hundred tons

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.171 align:middle line:84%
of radioactive material
that's leaking in

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.473 align:middle line:84%
and no government
is coming forward

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.009 align:middle line:84%
and saying let's
protect our citizens,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:84%
I mean this stuff is
going all over the world,

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.146 align:middle line:90%
I mean look at this Mike.

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:53.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But that's three
hundred tons per day

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Per day.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.584 align:middle line:84%
> Mike: going into the Pacific
Ocean radioactive water,

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:90%
yeah everyday it's incredible.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
listen to this:

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.289 align:middle line:90%
Since the first eleven weeks

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.459 align:middle line:84%
since Fukushima there were
fourteen thousand deaths

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.329 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
due to Fukushima.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.497 align:middle line:84%
There's been a thirty
five percent increase

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in mortality rates during
the first eleven weeks

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:90%
post Fukushima.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:18.539 align:middle line:84%
Vancouver had a sixty
percent increase death rate.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
Philadelphia had forty
eight percent increase

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.711 align:middle line:84%
because they received the
most amount of rainfall

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.915 align:middle line:84%
and what people aren't talking
about Mike is what happens

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:84%
when this radiation
goes into the air?

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It literally forms plumes
and clouds that can travel

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.689 align:middle line:84%
with wind direction
anywhere across the nation,

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.524 align:middle line:84%
or anywhere around the
world for that matter.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And the place
they really do travel

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.095 align:middle line:90%
to is North America.

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:45.065 align:middle line:84%
So because of the air stream,
the way the wind currents move

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:49.036 align:middle line:84%
across the planet, not only do
you have this radiation being

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.238 align:middle line:84%
emitted from the Fukushima
power plants but then a lot

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.775 align:middle line:84%
of it falls on agricultural
lands and even

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:90%
on living communities in the US.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.415 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I want to show
people these radiation meters.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle line:84%
This one is called the
inspector and this costs

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:90%
about six hundred dollars

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.724 align:middle line:84%
and you can hear it clicking
every time it clicks that's one

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.994 align:middle line:84%
unit of radiation being
detected and it's got a scale

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of microsieverts and right
now what you're hearing is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.032 align:middle line:90%
background radiation.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.567 align:middle line:84%
So no I'm not frying
and dying right now,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
this is background radiation
that you're going to get,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.073 align:middle line:84%
it also has a silent mode if you
want to put it on silent mode

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.841 align:middle line:84%
and you can just see the
results you're getting,

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:34.048 align:middle line:84%
which right now is showing .006
what is unit milirems per hour

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.616 align:middle line:84%
and it has microsieverts
as well.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:38.886 align:middle line:84%
That's an alarm,
that's not good.

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:43.724 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it beeped right
then but you can set alarms

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.893 align:middle line:84%
so that if it goes over a
certain level, then it's going

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.294 align:middle line:90%
to give you a warning.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Here's another radiation
detector we have right here.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.101 align:middle line:84%
This one is less expensive,
it's called the Mazur,

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.969 align:middle line:90%
it's the same basic function,

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.139 align:middle line:84%
they both have radiation
detection capabilities using

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.209 align:middle line:84%
these sensors on the back and
you can use these actually

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to check for radiation in food,
or even hardware products.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The
capital building

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:12.386 align:middle line:84%
in Washington is radioactive
because they have high levels

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.188 align:middle line:90%
of uranium in the marble in all

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.824 align:middle line:84%
of the building materials
the granite, they didn't test

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:18.492 align:middle line:84%
that before they built
the capital building,

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.994 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the most
toxic places

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.663 align:middle line:90%
to work in the United States

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:23.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's freaky.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: But the fact

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.167 align:middle line:84%
of the matter is I
mean you have people

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.471 align:middle line:84%
that are literally getting
poisoned by this radiation all

00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
over the world and
it's not on the news.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's why
Mike and I wanted

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.876 align:middle line:90%
to bring this information.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.413 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's really hard for
us to sit here and say this

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:43.083 align:middle line:84%
but Mike and I you know really
dove in and started looking

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.818 align:middle line:84%
at the results and
I mean we're going

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:90%
to show you a map right here

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.989 align:middle line:84%
of just how bad the
Pacific Ocean really is.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.759 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you take
a look at this map

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Incredible.

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:53.927 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: you can see

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:59.233 align:middle line:84%
that the entire Pacific Ocean is
covered in either blue or red,

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:03.504 align:middle line:84%
or purple, signifying
the levels of radiation

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:05.873 align:middle line:84%
that are contaminated
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:09.109 align:middle line:84%
That's like half the world
right there, the water.

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah it's
quite alarming

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.646 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting this
released not only into the air

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.948 align:middle line:84%
like we already talked about
but also into the oceans.

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:19.286 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting seafood that
is showing much higher levels

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
of radiation than is normally
allowed by health authorities

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.093 align:middle line:84%
in countries like Japan,
or like the United States.

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:30.998 align:middle line:84%
But Fukushima by the way is
only one source of radiation

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.666 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
concerned about.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.636 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk today too
in this episode of Secrets

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:39.306 align:middle line:84%
to Health about medical
imaging radiation.

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:43.142 align:middle line:84%
This is the other huge
source of ionizing radiation

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.379 align:middle line:84%
that you are probably
exposed to.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.615 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that a CT scan
for example can expose you

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:52.753 align:middle line:84%
to over a thousand X-rays
worth of ionizing radiation,

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or you can get some nuclear
imaging done at a hospital,

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:90%
different types of tests

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.627 align:middle line:84%
that use radioactive isotopes
circulating through your blood

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:03.697 align:middle line:84%
and they can expose you
to so much radiation,

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:08.235 align:middle line:84%
and this is a fact, that
you can actually be detained

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:11.772 align:middle line:84%
by Homeland Security for
riding home on a subway,

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:15.476 align:middle line:84%
or driving home, you will set
off the terrorism radiation

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle line:84%
sensors that are all
across the country.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle line:84%
This happened to a
guy on the east coast.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
They came onto the subway car
and they almost arrested him

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.787 align:middle line:84%
because he was radioactive
coming out of the hospital.

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:28.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean you would
think that all of the years

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:32.793 align:middle line:84%
that we have to perfect medical
devices that we wouldn't have

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:35.262 align:middle line:84%
to kill people and
radiate people to figure

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.431 align:middle line:84%
out what's wrong with them
and actually we don't.

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.899 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's technology
out there.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.001 align:middle line:90%
I mean one of the things,

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.639 align:middle line:84%
CT scans like Mike said are
highly radiating to the body.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.674 align:middle line:84%
You can replace a
lot of these scans

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:50.177 align:middle line:90%
with thermography for example.

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:52.713 align:middle line:84%
I mean listen there
are a massive amount

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.148 align:middle line:84%
of thyroid disorders
in the world

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.984 align:middle line:84%
and what does the
medical profession do

00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:59.786 align:middle line:90%
if you have hypothyroid?

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:06.093 align:middle line:84%
They put radioactive iodine
131 into your thyroid gland

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:90%
and it kills the thyroid gland.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.363 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they
take your appendix

00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:11.798 align:middle line:84%
out they just think you
don't need organs you know.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:15.068 align:middle line:84%
Whoever came up with the
idea of just taking organs

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.137 align:middle line:84%
out of your system when
something is wrong?

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.405 align:middle line:90%
I mean

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:19.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's called
reductionist western medicine,

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.874 align:middle line:90%
that's what they do.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:24.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's called
always treating drug,

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:27.614 align:middle line:84%
cut and burn approach and always
addressing the symptoms instead

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.116 align:middle line:90%
of the root cause.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:31.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, yeah exactly
if they find something wrong

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:33.487 align:middle line:84%
with a body part they just want
to cut it off or remove it,

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:35.322 align:middle line:90%
or burn it out with radiation

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
like you were just
talking about.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.791 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty crazy.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.061 align:middle line:84%
But our focus here is the
help you stay protected

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.429 align:middle line:90%
from radiation.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:45.465 align:middle line:84%
So later on in this episode
Ed is going to talk about some

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.035 align:middle line:84%
of the protection and
the detox methods.

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.504 align:middle line:84%
There are many natural
remedies and foods

00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:52.005 align:middle line:84%
that have been used
traditionally throughout

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:55.742 align:middle line:84%
history, even in Japan
after the bombings of WWII,

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.145 align:middle line:84%
which was let's be
honest about this,

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.715 align:middle line:84%
that was the United States
government dropping an atomic

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:05.886 align:middle line:84%
weapon on a civilian population,
not a military target

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.355 align:middle line:90%
but a civilian population twice

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:11.124 align:middle line:84%
and today we even
have depleted uranium,

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:14.761 align:middle line:84%
a weapon of mass destruction,
it's an indiscriminate killer

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:18.332 align:middle line:84%
that is being used in the
Middle East by the United States

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:21.501 align:middle line:84%
and both of these are
causing really Holocausts

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.871 align:middle line:84%
of radiation damage in many
populations around the world.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.774 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just those
of you who may be

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:31.912 align:middle line:84%
in the USA watching this, you've
got to deal with Fukushima,

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.348 align:middle line:84%
there are people all over the
world who have to deal with this

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:38.785 align:middle line:84%
because there is literal fallout
from the military imperialism

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that United States government
has conducted since the 1940s.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,
and the bad thing

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:49.196 align:middle line:84%
about radiation is the half-life
and that it just doesn't go away

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:50.664 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.633 align:middle line:90%
But another you know kind

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.235 align:middle line:84%
of a conspiracy thing
Mike is the Russians

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:58.538 align:middle line:84%
for example developed
sponge type situations

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.107 align:middle line:84%
where they could
absorb radiation.

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:03.343 align:middle line:84%
I've read that people
have developed types

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:07.914 align:middle line:84%
of clean-up mechanisms that
can neutralize the radiation

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.917 align:middle line:84%
to where we don't have those
long half-life's anymore,

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.619 align:middle line:84%
we're not poisoning
the environment

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:16.023 align:middle line:84%
and poisoning the soil and the
government is trying to figure

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:90%
out what do we do with all

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.559 align:middle line:84%
of these spent nuclear
rods everywhere?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.229 align:middle line:84%
I mean there has been
solutions they just haven't been

00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:24.131 align:middle line:90%
implemented and you know one

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:26.233 align:middle line:84%
of the things I'm wondering
is why they haven't been

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:29.202 align:middle line:84%
implemented I mean you
know we've had solutions.

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:32.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah that's a good
point but radiation, well,

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:35.375 align:middle line:84%
first let me address the
isotopes you mentioned some

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:36.677 align:middle line:90%
of the half-lives.

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:39.546 align:middle line:84%
You have short half-lives
from things like iodine 131

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.449 align:middle line:84%
that isotope, which I believe
the half-life is only seven

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:43.216 align:middle line:90%
days, or

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:44.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: eight days.

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Eight days,
it's very short.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:48.155 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got uranium
and the uranium that comes

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:49.423 align:middle line:90%
out of atomic weapons

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:53.827 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear tests right
the half-life of some

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
of those elements is
millions of years.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.699 align:middle line:84%
So this is not something
that you're going to get rid

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:02.669 align:middle line:84%
of easily, unless there's some
real breakthrough treatment.

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.972 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing as a
species if you were to look

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
down on the planet from like an
alien UFO looking down on earth

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.013 align:middle line:84%
or something, you would say
wow these people are blowing

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:17.184 align:middle line:84%
up bombs in their own home
why are they doing that?

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:20.087 align:middle line:84%
And there have been hundreds
of nuclear tests over the years

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:23.623 align:middle line:84%
so there is uranium
fallout, nuclear,

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:28.161 align:middle line:84%
radioactive isotopes have been
falling out all over the world

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:31.565 align:middle line:84%
for you know since the dawn
of testing of nuclear weapons,

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:37.637 align:middle line:84%
which I believe began in
1943 was it something 44,

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.706 align:middle line:90%
right around that time.

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
know this is something

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.743 align:middle line:90%
that you just don't hear about.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:45.579 align:middle line:84%
I mean you don't hear about it
on mainstream TV, it's something

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that I recommend everybody goes
and does their own research

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.619 align:middle line:84%
and starts typing in
ionizing radiation

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.521 align:middle line:84%
and starts doing
their own research

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.957 align:middle line:84%
on because I think
it's serious enough

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.492 align:middle line:84%
and Mike thinks it
serious enough

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:90%
to actually do a show about it.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.429 align:middle line:84%
I mean we've personally
talked to people

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:05.632 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific Northwest
from up in Vancouver,

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:10.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're hearing stories of
skin rashes, hair falling out,

00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
we're hearing stories
of cellular DNA damage,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous abortions.

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:18.245 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear this stuff on the
news; it was like what happened

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:20.781 align:middle line:84%
with the whole BP oil spill,
not to get off the subject

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.015 align:middle line:90%
with all the [inaudible].

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.051 align:middle line:84%
I was on the phone with
people from down in the gulf

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:90%
and they had severe problems

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.789 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
suffering severe problems.

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:31.358 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that's a serious issue

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.227 align:middle line:84%
and everybody needs
to take this seriously

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:36.363 align:middle line:84%
and start protecting
themselves and their family

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.965 align:middle line:84%
against this nuclear
radiation fallout.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I got to back up Ed on
this one it's why I want to jump

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
in there but we've covered
stories on natural news

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:84%
where you had people undergo
radio therapy treatments

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:52.579 align:middle line:84%
for brain tumors and when
they finished the treatment,

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.648 align:middle line:84%
they found out machines
were miscalibrated.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:59.286 align:middle line:84%
This is very common across
the medical industry.

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:03.089 align:middle line:84%
Machines are miscalibarated
and this person it fried all

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.827 align:middle line:84%
around their head, they had
severe burns, their hair fell

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:10.063 align:middle line:84%
out and then they had more
cancer all in their skin

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:13.633 align:middle line:84%
and their skull as a result of
this radiotherapy treatment.

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:16.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean they use radiation
as a treatment for cancer

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:18.271 align:middle line:84%
but the treatment
causes more cancer

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:20.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The radiation
causes cancer, right.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's so bizarre.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean won't don't
the turn Fukushima

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.911 align:middle line:90%
into a treatment cancer center?

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
listen to this:

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:30.517 align:middle line:84%
One series of mammograms is
equivalent to the radiation dose

00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of a thousand normal chest
x-rays or spinal x-rays.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's huge.

00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That means
when a woman goes in

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.159 align:middle line:84%
and look how often do the
doctors say you need to go

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:42.729 align:middle line:84%
in for regular mammograms,
and they used to be over forty

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:46.099 align:middle line:84%
but now they're saying they're
wanting women to go in at twenty

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
for yearly mammograms.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.204 align:middle line:84%
So let's say no wonder breast
cancer is so prevalent right now

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:55.642 align:middle line:84%
and now you have women that
are doing double mastectomies

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:58.211 align:middle line:84%
to prevent breast cancer
in the first place.

00:12:58.211 --> 00:12:59.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Just because
of genetics.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:01.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But you're
radiation tissue is what you're

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.515 align:middle line:84%
doing, you're radiating
you're radiating tissue

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:05.118 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I recommend
women do thermography instead

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:05.919 align:middle line:90%
of mammograms.

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: So much safer,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.356 align:middle line:84%
thermography is not
emitting ionizing radiation;

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
it's simply detecting the
natural infrared light rays,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.196 align:middle line:84%
invisible light rays that
your body is giving off.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:18.832 align:middle line:84%
But on this point of mammography
this is really crucial

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:22.369 align:middle line:84%
because we've also reported
on this extensively.

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.271 align:middle line:84%
Mammograms as they
are recommended

00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:28.642 align:middle line:84%
and conducted today harm ten
women for every one woman

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.677 align:middle line:84%
who is ultimately
helped by them.

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:34.314 align:middle line:84%
Most mammograms are actually
causing false positives.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.716 align:middle line:84%
There are so many cases
of false positives

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:39.653 align:middle line:84%
where women have been told
hey you have breast cancer,

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:42.956 align:middle line:84%
if you don't so something
now chemotherapy, radiation,

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.724 align:middle line:90%
surgery, mastectomies,

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:45.959 align:middle line:84%
if you don't do something
now you're going

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.427 align:middle line:90%
to die in six months.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:51.665 align:middle line:84%
From this state of fear
that oncologists use kind

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:54.567 align:middle line:84%
of like a recruitment
weapon against women,

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:57.103 align:middle line:84%
many women succumb to
that fear and they give in

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:58.471 align:middle line:90%
and they undergo treatment.

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:00.941 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman in Canada
that just happened recently,

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.944 align:middle line:84%
she did I think three
rounds of chemotherapy,

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
she had liver damage, heart
damage, kidney damage,

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.482 align:middle line:84%
she lost most of her muscle
mass, her hair fell out

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:12.886 align:middle line:84%
and then her oncologist
admitted he made a mistake,

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:14.521 align:middle line:90%
she didn't have cancer at all.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:18.258 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what's going on in
the cancer industry is based

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:22.429 align:middle line:84%
on false positives, and it's
using mammography as a system

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
that actually gives you cancer

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.733 align:middle line:84%
because it irradiates
your breast tissue,

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:30.036 align:middle line:84%
it irradiates your heart and
it irradiates your lungs.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.338 align:middle line:90%
So don't ever think

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that mammography is
only detecting things,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.943 align:middle line:84%
it's actually giving you
cancer at the same time.

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:40.914 align:middle line:84%
I mean radiation has been
known to cause cancer.

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:84%
And especially people you
know I talked to a lot

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.085 align:middle line:90%
of brain cancer patients

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:47.821 align:middle line:84%
and every time they do
a surgical procedure,

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:50.757 align:middle line:84%
or they take it out, it's
just more and more radiation

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.927 align:middle line:84%
and then not only not only the
point of specific radiation

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:57.464 align:middle line:84%
but after that they follow
up with continued PET scans

00:14:57.464 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:84%
and CT scans to see the
progress of the radiation

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.636 align:middle line:84%
so what they're doing is
actually radiating it even more.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:06.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: In fact, there's so
much nuclear material used

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:10.143 align:middle line:84%
in the medical imaging
industry that the Department

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:84%
of Homeland Security has
openly talked about this,

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:17.717 align:middle line:84%
terrorists can actually acquire
old medical imaging equipment

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:21.888 align:middle line:84%
and they can gather the nuclear
material in that equipment

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.524 align:middle line:84%
and use it to manufacture
a dirty bomb,

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:28.161 align:middle line:84%
an actual terrorist weapon that
could be deployed against a city

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.797 align:middle line:84%
in the United States or
somewhere else around the world.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:34.401 align:middle line:84%
And what a dirty bomb is just
spreading radiation everywhere

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.271 align:middle line:84%
and using it to poison you know
potentially millions of people

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.408 align:middle line:84%
if it were released in a place
like New York for example.

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:44.377 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
silent killer weapon

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:47.647 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't see a
mushroom cloud in the distance,

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:50.517 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have any idea
that you were being poisoned

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:54.354 align:middle line:84%
and this is why the government
has the radiation meters to say,

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:55.722 align:middle line:84%
to you know to have
the alarms go off

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:58.023 align:middle line:84%
and say wow wait a minute
there's radiation happening

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:01.027 align:middle line:84%
so they could warn people
to actually try to get away,

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:04.631 align:middle line:84%
but you can't evacuate New
York City so forget it.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah exactly
so you know most of the shows

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.869 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about is like
we show you the toxins

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:84%
and the chemicals
that you're exposed to

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:15.141 align:middle line:84%
and then we say just avoid those
or here's how you can get them

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.912 align:middle line:84%
out of your body, but with
radiation it's you know it's

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:84%
different everywhere
you go and it's not

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:23.349 align:middle line:84%
like we can say you know
you're exposed to this amount

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.485 align:middle line:84%
and then you're exposed to
this amount of radiation,

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.522 align:middle line:84%
it literally is a slow killer
over a long period of time

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and couple that with all of the
other toxins that you're exposed

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
to on a daily basis and it's
just completely damaging

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.934 align:middle line:84%
to the cells and wreaks
havoc on the body.

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:42.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's right,
you've got the heavy metals

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:90%
that we've talked about before,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.173 align:middle line:84%
you've got other synthetic
chemicals, bisphenol A,

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.243 align:middle line:84%
these types of things but
let's start to transition

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:51.578 align:middle line:90%
into some solutions because

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:52.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, hold on
though I want to talk to you

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:54.414 align:middle line:84%
about something cause you
know what it's bothering me.

00:16:54.414 --> 00:16:55.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: We're freaking them out
Ed, they want some solutions.

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know
I just had to fly back

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.986 align:middle line:84%
and I had you know
every time I go

00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:02.989 align:middle line:84%
to the airport all I see is
more of these TSA body scanners,

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
more and more and
more and more of them.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Exactly, I'm
glad you brought that up.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:06.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Tell
us what you know

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:08.194 align:middle line:90%
about the TSA body scanners.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, they claim
that there's a certain level

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:11.798 align:middle line:84%
of radiation that these
body scanners emit

00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:13.600 align:middle line:90%
but the fascinating fact Ed is

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.836 align:middle line:84%
that the TSA will not
submit those machines

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:19.105 align:middle line:84%
to independent laboratory
testing.

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:21.541 align:middle line:84%
They refuse to but
they release a number

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.908 align:middle line:84%
and they say oh you're
only exposed

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle line:84%
to what do they say .01
microsieverts I don't remember

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.815 align:middle line:84%
what number they use
but it's very small.

00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:30.116 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that
that's even true.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:31.584 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is an agency

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:33.686 align:middle line:84%
that has lied again
and again and again.

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:36.823 align:middle line:84%
So you are getting extra
radiation at the airport,

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:38.892 align:middle line:84%
on top of the medical
imaging radiation,

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:42.662 align:middle line:84%
on top of the mammography,
on top of cancer treatments,

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:46.266 align:middle line:84%
on top the radiation you get
from flying in an airplane,

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:49.235 align:middle line:84%
plus you could have radiation
from Fukushima in the air,

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:52.071 align:middle line:84%
in the food, and you could have
radon gas in your basement.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:56.943 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this cumulative
load that is very very dangerous

00:17:56.943 --> 00:18:00.446 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you need to have
meters like this in your home

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:84%
to check your home for radon
radiation, you could check food,

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:05.151 align:middle line:84%
you could check products,
you can make sure

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:08.755 align:middle line:84%
that you are not living in
a radioactive environment.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes and you
know we know about Fukushima

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
but I mean there are people
and scientists that are coming

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
out now saying that
here's multiple leaks

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.568 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear reactors all over
the world that are being covered

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.469 align:middle line:90%
up and not being talked about.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:27.473 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is the best way
you can avoid this is don't go

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
through the body scanners,
I mean don't feel pressured

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.911 align:middle line:90%
when you get to the airport.

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:34.614 align:middle line:84%
When I get there and you know
now they're pushing everybody

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
through the body scanners, I
just yell out as loud as I can,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:84%
opt out, and then you know they
freak out and they call somebody

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.022 align:middle line:84%
over there and I have to
go through a pat down,

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:45.925 align:middle line:84%
which I'd rather go
through a pat down than have

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:48.361 align:middle line:90%
to be extremely highly radiated

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.364 align:middle line:84%
because if you've ever
seen the image taken

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:55.735 align:middle line:84%
from a TSA body scanner, I
mean it pretty much shows all

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:57.337 align:middle line:90%
of your nudity and everything.

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:58.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah and if you go
through a pat down ask them

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.808 align:middle line:84%
to change their gloves first
because they don't change gloves

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:02.876 align:middle line:90%
between patting people down.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:05.712 align:middle line:90%
But that's a whole other topic.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:09.449 align:middle line:84%
That's scary let's talk about
solutions for radiation.

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:13.553 align:middle line:84%
So solution number 1 is
of course avoidance right?

00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:17.624 align:middle line:84%
If you can avoid being close to
Fukushima, or even in the path

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:19.692 align:middle line:84%
of the air currents
and the ocean currents,

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:20.927 align:middle line:90%
that's your best choice,

00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:24.564 align:middle line:84%
avoidance of exposure is
always strategy number one.

00:19:24.564 --> 00:19:28.234 align:middle line:84%
But Ed what happens if you
are exposed to radiation.

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
What can you do nutritionally to
help yourself repair the damage

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and also eliminate radioactive
isotopes from your body?

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, I get
that question all the time

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:41.814 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing I
tell people is don't wait

00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:43.549 align:middle line:90%
until it's too late.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.251 align:middle line:90%
You know what you have to do,

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:48.254 align:middle line:84%
the number one element
I recommend is iodine

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
because iodine 131
is going to come down

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.659 align:middle line:84%
and radiation damages
the thyroid

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:56.663 align:middle line:84%
and once the thyroid is gone all
of the endocrine glands start

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:58.197 align:middle line:90%
to malfunction after that.

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:02.769 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend right now
I mean it's start loading

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:06.506 align:middle line:84%
up on good nascent
atomic iodine,

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.875 align:middle line:90%
that way if you are exposed

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.011 align:middle line:84%
to radiation then your
body is going to be able

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:15.048 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize it cause what
happens is that iodine 131

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:18.751 align:middle line:84%
that radioactive iodine, it
goes into the receptor sites

00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:20.586 align:middle line:84%
in your thyroid gland
and starts ruining it

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:24.524 align:middle line:84%
so if you're heavy
dosing of nason iodine,

00:20:24.524 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:84%
one of the best ways to protect
yourself against radiation.

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:31.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now another
common product is chlorella,

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:34.367 align:middle line:84%
this is something that we
did a lot of research on

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:38.071 align:middle line:84%
and sourced this from all around
the world we did the lab tests

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.772 align:middle line:84%
on the cleanest sources
of chlorella.

00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:43.142 align:middle line:84%
But chlorella has been used
traditionally throughout the

00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:46.612 align:middle line:84%
history of nuclear accidents
and even nuclear attacks

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.082 align:middle line:84%
to help support the
body's elimination

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:84%
of radioactive isotopes and
its well documented for that.

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:56.189 align:middle line:84%
And there are also some clays
you can use dietary clays

00:20:56.189 --> 00:20:57.523 align:middle line:90%
right Ed?

00:20:57.523 --> 00:21:00.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes what we
have here is a bentonite clay,

00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
a bentonite clay has been used
at Chernobyl, it's been used all

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.633 align:middle line:84%
for many nuclear
disasters, or nuclear spills,

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:11.337 align:middle line:84%
or any time they need to clean
up any type of radiation.

00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:14.507 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing is you
can take it internally,

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:18.144 align:middle line:84%
you can take it internally, or
some people have even coated it

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:21.848 align:middle line:84%
over their skin to
relieve radiation exposure

00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:22.782 align:middle line:90%
from their skin.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.051 align:middle line:84%
So bentonite clay,
and by the way,

00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:27.553 align:middle line:84%
these are the most
effective ways

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:30.456 align:middle line:90%
to neutralize harmful radiation.

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:34.694 align:middle line:84%
The bentonite clay and
another compound is zeolite.

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:35.928 align:middle line:90%
In Chernobyl and some

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:39.298 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear reactors
actually they mix zeolites

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.235 align:middle line:84%
in with the cement walls
because it's so good

00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:44.871 align:middle line:90%
at absorbing ionizing radiation

00:21:44.871 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and zeolites can be
taken internally as well.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about bentonite
clay and zeolites though,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.182 align:middle line:84%
Mike and I always look for
the highest quality standards

00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:57.617 align:middle line:90%
in all the supplements.

00:21:57.617 --> 00:22:02.789 align:middle line:84%
Don't just run out and buy
bentonite clay from a pet store,

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or zeolites from some over the
counter drug store or something

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.096 align:middle line:84%
like that, make sure
you do your research,

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:15.101 align:middle line:84%
make sure you get a high quality
component and then you can take

00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:84%
that internally to help you
with those type of situation.

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You know I'm really
glad you mentioned that because

00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:22.408 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory testing
that we did do on chlorella

00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:23.843 align:middle line:90%
in our forensic food lab,

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.679 align:middle line:84%
we found differences
huge differences

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.047 align:middle line:90%
in the level of metals.

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:31.651 align:middle line:84%
For example, some chlorella had
only three parts per million

00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:34.587 align:middle line:84%
of aluminum, other chlorella's
had thirty three parts

00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:35.621 align:middle line:90%
per million.

00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:38.724 align:middle line:84%
You know so eleven
times more aluminum,

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.992 align:middle line:90%
which you don't really want.

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that most
chlorella is quite clean

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:84%
so we didn't find anything that
had really dangerous levels

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.501 align:middle line:84%
of lead or mercury
in it, which is great

00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:52.305 align:middle line:84%
but cilantro is another
wonderful, natural herb,

00:22:52.305 --> 00:22:56.108 align:middle line:84%
you can grow it in your own
kitchen just in a windowsill

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:59.345 align:middle line:84%
and cilantro is now being
studied scientifically studied

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:03.883 align:middle line:84%
as a water bioremediation plant,
a miracle plant if you will

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:07.053 align:middle line:84%
that absorbs lead,
it absorbs cadmium

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.188 align:middle line:84%
and arsenic right
out of the water.

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:11.357 align:middle line:84%
So it does the same thing
in your body as well.

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:14.026 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get some
cilantro in your body,

00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:84%
you can absorb many of
those radioactive elements

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.233 align:middle line:84%
that are threatening
your health.

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.467 align:middle line:90%
And lastly before I go back

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to you Ed I want to
mention chelation.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.106 align:middle line:84%
There are many clinicians
around the United States

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:31.444 align:middle line:84%
who are highly skilled at
removing toxic elements

00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:34.247 align:middle line:84%
from your body, including
mercury, including lead,

00:23:34.247 --> 00:23:36.816 align:middle line:84%
arsenic, cadmium and
many other elements,

00:23:36.816 --> 00:23:39.218 align:middle line:84%
and they can use these
chelation elements,

00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:41.387 align:middle line:84%
many of them are
used intravenously

00:23:41.387 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:90%
and they're very safe.

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:45.525 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are
FDA approved to,

00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:48.494 align:middle line:84%
for example to treat
acute lead toxicity,

00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and these agents
are very effective

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.165 align:middle line:90%
and can save your life.

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:55.067 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel that
you are suffering

00:23:55.067 --> 00:24:00.439 align:middle line:84%
from acute radiation poisoning,
I think that it's very wise

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:05.011 align:middle line:84%
to find yourself a chelation
practitioner and check

00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:08.347 align:middle line:84%
out chelation and how that can
help remove these toxic elements

00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:10.149 align:middle line:90%
from the body, it's very useful.

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:12.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And believe
it or not you now one

00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:14.887 align:middle line:84%
of the most effective
things to put in IVs and one

00:24:14.887 --> 00:24:17.957 align:middle line:84%
of the most effective things
to get rid of radiation

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:23.129 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't talked about
yet is DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide,

00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:26.299 align:middle line:84%
it's an antioxidant compound
it's actually a solvent,

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:30.269 align:middle line:84%
it was widely used in the
animal and veterinary fields

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
when horses got sprained ankles,
or anything happened to cattle,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:90%
they would put DMSO on there.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.644 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very strong
anti-inflammatory agent.

00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:42.315 align:middle line:84%
But it has also been
used and shown effective

00:24:42.315 --> 00:24:45.985 align:middle line:84%
at reducing the exposure of
radiation actually binding

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:49.855 align:middle line:84%
and eliminating radioactive
particles from the body.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I got a question: Do
they use that intravenously?

00:24:52.525 --> 00:24:53.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They do
use DMSO intravenously.

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:58.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Wow that's fascinating
cause I'm aware of EDTA and DMPS

00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:00.466 align:middle line:90%
and many of the others.

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:02.702 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware of DMSO
being used intravenously.

00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Well the thing

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.172 align:middle line:84%
about DMSO is you could put
something it doesn't taste good

00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:08.374 align:middle line:84%
but you could put some in your
mouth and it goes straight

00:25:08.374 --> 00:25:09.709 align:middle line:90%
into your blood stream.

00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:11.677 align:middle line:84%
Now you can also put it in
your skin, it would go straight

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.045 align:middle line:90%
into your blood stream too.

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:16.449 align:middle line:84%
It's great for any tennis elbow
or any type of inflammation

00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:90%
that you have inside your body.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But you want to be careful
with DMSO and make sure

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.154 align:middle line:90%
that your skin is very,

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:25.491 align:middle line:84%
very clean because if you
have some poison on your skin

00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:27.693 align:middle line:84%
and then you mix some DMSO
it's going to go straight

00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:28.828 align:middle line:90%
into your bloodstream.

00:25:28.828 --> 00:25:30.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You really
need to be cautious

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:32.531 align:middle line:84%
with these chelation agents
because they can also bind

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to nutritional elements
and minerals

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.636 align:middle line:90%
like zinc and magnesium.

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:39.438 align:middle line:84%
You can actually cause
problems with your heart beat

00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:84%
if you pull all of the
magnesium out of your blood.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:46.846 align:middle line:84%
So Ed and I both agree that you
should seek professional help

00:25:46.846 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing these
kinds of detox programs.

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.951 align:middle line:90%
Chelation is serious business.

00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:53.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It is serious
business and you can also go

00:25:53.853 --> 00:25:55.621 align:middle line:84%
into kidney failure
if it's not done right

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:59.425 align:middle line:84%
because the kidneys take in
all of that toxic buildup.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.128 align:middle line:84%
Another couple of things that
we didn't touch on though is

00:26:02.128 --> 00:26:06.332 align:middle line:84%
and these are in the atmosphere
too is strontium and cesium,

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:09.235 align:middle line:84%
radioactive cesium
which is cesium 137

00:26:09.235 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and usually strontium 90.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:15.741 align:middle line:84%
Now Linus Pauling, the great
vitamin C researcher found

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:19.845 align:middle line:84%
that calcium reduced
strontium absorption

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:21.714 align:middle line:90%
by up to ninety percent.

00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.883 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other
things that work really,

00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
really good for strontium,
not only iodine but strontium

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.956 align:middle line:84%
and cesium are beets
believe it or not.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.359 align:middle line:84%
So start incorporating
more fresh beets.

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:36.062 align:middle line:84%
I like beet juice if you have
a juicer you could do some

00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:37.263 align:middle line:90%
beet juice.

00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're going to get
a lot more benefits too

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.568 align:middle line:84%
than just radiation
protection from beets.

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:46.138 align:middle line:84%
I also recommend and I'm sure
you do too whenever you talk

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:90%
about calcium and magnesium.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.078 align:middle line:84%
Calcium and magnesium are
very heavy duty protectors

00:26:52.078 --> 00:26:53.145 align:middle line:90%
against radiation.

00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:55.247 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different forms out there,

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
do not go with the
cheap calcium carbonate,

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
the only ones I recommend
are calcium orotate

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.688 align:middle line:90%
and magnesium orotate.

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:04.557 align:middle line:84%
The only types of calcium
that have been proven

00:27:04.557 --> 00:27:06.358 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Hans Nieper

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:09.829 align:middle line:84%
who is probably the most famous
mineral transporter doctor

00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:13.666 align:middle line:84%
out of Germany, that proved
that the only form of calcium

00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:84%
and the magnesium to go
into the mitochondria

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:18.637 align:middle line:84%
of the cell was in
the orotate form.

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: There's some really
great supplements out there

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:23.843 align:middle line:84%
that could also help you with
natural detoxification pathways.

00:27:23.843 --> 00:27:25.711 align:middle line:84%
You've got supplements
that help with methylation

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:90%
like vitamin B12 for example.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:33.352 align:middle line:84%
You've also got glutathione;
it's a great dietary supplement

00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:35.087 align:middle line:84%
if you can get it
in a liposomal form

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't get
destroyed by digestion.

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:42.328 align:middle line:84%
The glutathione vastly improves
your detoxification pathways.

00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:46.699 align:middle line:84%
So part of the strategy Ed is
to make sure that you have day

00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:50.469 align:middle line:84%
to day health that supports
the body's natural healing

00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:53.506 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms, natural
elimination mechanisms.

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:55.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about what you
found in your history of dealing

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:59.311 align:middle line:84%
with patients but I see that
people who are most effected

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:02.681 align:middle line:84%
by toxic elements are people
who have very poor states

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:03.783 align:middle line:90%
of health in the first place.

00:28:03.783 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The
most important thing,

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.019 align:middle line:84%
these are all great
remedies and these are things

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.788 align:middle line:90%
that will protect your body,

00:28:08.788 --> 00:28:12.558 align:middle line:84%
but the most important thing
is getting your body in shape

00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:13.793 align:middle line:90%
and getting your body cleansed.

00:28:13.793 --> 00:28:17.263 align:middle line:84%
You know Mike so many
people have toxic livers

00:28:17.263 --> 00:28:22.101 align:middle line:84%
and liver is the organ that
helps you detoxify these things.

00:28:22.101 --> 00:28:24.303 align:middle line:84%
Do liver and gallbladder
cleanses.

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:25.504 align:middle line:90%
I mean cleanse your liver

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and cleanse your intestines
on a regular basis.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.075 align:middle line:84%
Cleanse your kidneys,
do chemical

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:32.278 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metal cleanse,
do parasite cleansing.

00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:35.481 align:middle line:84%
I mean the cleaner that you can
keep the inside of your body,

00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:37.383 align:middle line:90%
the better your body will be

00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:39.652 align:middle line:84%
and the more protected
your cells will be

00:28:39.652 --> 00:28:43.722 align:middle line:84%
against radiation damage
and other toxic damage.

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:44.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Absolutely.

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:46.659 align:middle line:84%
And stop adding more
chemical burden to your body,

00:28:46.659 --> 00:28:50.629 align:middle line:84%
for example, vaccines do still
contain mercury, formaldehyde,

00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:53.165 align:middle line:90%
MSG, aluminum and antibiotics

00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:55.067 align:middle line:84%
and those can damage
your kidney and livers.

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They create extra
burden so be very careful

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.539 align:middle line:84%
about any extra burden that
you're putting on your body

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:03.342 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
impair your natural

00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
detoxification pathway.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're living downstream from
Fukushima you want to make sure

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:84%
that you are in an outstanding
state of health so you can deal

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.885 align:middle line:84%
with any emergencies
that might come your way.

00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:15.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely, and
stay abreast of the situation.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:18.691 align:middle line:84%
Look online, YouTube does a good
job of updating what's going

00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:22.027 align:middle line:84%
on with plumes and everything
coming from Fukushima.

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:26.065 align:middle line:84%
