00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Biohacking, it's not
just about being well.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It's about being more than well.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is biohacking.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, you're
going to learn some things

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:10%
about hacking hormones.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And hormone levels are
a part of biohacking,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
because if those don't
work, you don't work.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
When I weighed 300 pounds,
I had my picture published

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
in entrepreneur magazine,
and my testosterone levels

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
were lower than my
mother's because

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of environmental toxins, because
of not knowing how to sleep,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
because of eating the wrong
foods, because of overtraining.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I learned how to
hack my hormone levels,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
it helped me to
get my brain back.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to guide you
through best practices,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to testing for
hormones and even hormone

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
replacement therapy.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
In most parts of
the world, you want

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to work with a doctor on
hormone replacement therapy,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but you can get
your levels, and you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
can change your life so your
hormones will work better.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:90%
All of that is in this episode.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are just
chemical messengers

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that tell your cells what to
do and how to do it and when.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They affect everything,
how you feel,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
how much you like your
partner, how much to eat

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
how many calories, you
should store as fat,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
even whether you're going
to have emotions that you

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.287 align:middle line:90%
can control or not control.

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stay young, you
have to have hormones that work

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and hormones that work
like a young person.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Hormones interact
with each other.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you change one, the other
ones will automatically change.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's a complex system.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
start with hormones

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that aren't the common ones,
like testosterone and estrogen.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But these are the hormones that
control hunger and satiety.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
If you can regulate those, you
won't be hungry all the time,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll eat
the right foods.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And that will, in turn,
affect your sex hormones.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the hormones that
really matters is leptin.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And leptin regulates
your metabolism,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and it signals you
to stop eating.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is the I'm full.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
a hunger hormone

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
called ghrelin,
which is something

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:90%
that basically says I'm hungry.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So you could get
enough animal protein

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to turn off ghrelin, which will
also affect your leptin levels.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:10%
What that means is having
30 grams of animal protein

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:10%
when you're eating a meal
could magically turn off hunger

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:10%
for several hours afterwards.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
you're directly

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
manipulating your hunger
and satiety hormone.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:10%
There's also something
called cholecystokinin,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:10%
which is a satiety
hormone that's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:10%
released by your
intestines after you eat.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:10%
Saturated fat helps
raise CCK levels.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
This is one reason a little
bit of grass-fed butter

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in your coffee or MCT
oil could go a long way

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
towards making you not hungry.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So all these
biohacking techniques

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
are actually hormone
manipulation techniques.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
There's also
insulin, and insulin

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is released when you eat,
especially carbohydrates.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's the key that
unlocks a cell that

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.878 align:middle line:90%
lets blood sugar into the cell.

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
So you need some insulin.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, insulin
is required if you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
want to put on muscle because
insulin, like growth factor,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is called that because
insulin makes you grow.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
happens with our hormones

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:10%
is that we become
resistant to insulin,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.785 align:middle line:10%
and this is when insulin
approaches a cell

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:10%
and tries to turn
the key, but the cell

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:10%
won't open up, so your
blood sugar levels rise.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what happens
when you get type 2 diabetes.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:90%
So what's causing that?

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out bad fats,
the omega 6 fats from plants

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
are the likely culprit, but so
is not knowing how to sleep.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you do about it?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could reverse
insulin resistance

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
by practicing
intermittent fasting

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and doing exercise, but
not too much, the way

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
you would learn in
the fitness episode.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:10%
If you eat the anti-inflammatory
diet in the nutrition episode,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:10%
you avoid a lot
of refined carbs,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:10%
like sugar and
white flour and stop

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:10%
eating artificial sweeteners
and artificial flavorings.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Add in that
intermittent fasting,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
practice some good sleep
practices, and move every day

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and exercise a
couple times a week,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
you might find that
you've magically

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:90%
fixed your insulin problem.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:10%
You could even go so long as
to get a continuous glucose

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:10%
monitor, like this
one, that lets

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:10%
you look at what your blood
sugar is any time of the day.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Then, you know, is
insulin my problem,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:90%
or is it not my problem?

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy to
figure that out these days

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
If your hunger hormones
are out of whack

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're hungry all the
time, and you think about food

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
with half your thoughts, you
could do the leptin reset

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:90%
that I write about.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.795 align:middle line:84%
Every morning, you start
your day with between,

00:04:57.795 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not,
this is from a study

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
28 to 50 grams of high
quality animal protein.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.072 align:middle line:84%
So this is for
one or two months.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
hungry all the time,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
because you have weight to
lose, that's several eggs.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That's a piece of meat in
the morning or a good quality

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
animal-based protein powder.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
That is going to completely
change the way your insulin

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:90%
hormone works.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that, when
you change your insulin levels,

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that your leptin,
because this is a leptin reset,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
leptin controls your thyroid.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Your thyroid, which we're
going to talk about next,

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is the master hormone that
controls your thermostat.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:10%
So if your body
needs lots of energy,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:10%
you want it to
burn all the food,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.895 align:middle line:10%
if you have enough
thyroid, you will do that.

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:10%
You'll have lots of energy.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you're low thyroid,
you don't have enough energy.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.962 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
don't have enough energy

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to get off the couch and go
do something that matters.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid is a complex hormone,
but one that is off, probably,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in half of people right now.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
Hashimoto's thyroiditis

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:90%
when I was 26 years old.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
My thyroid levels were
nearly undetectable.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I had
prescription thyroid,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I just remember this feeling.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:90%
The lights turned back on.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It was so dramatic.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I actually developed a fear
of not having my thyroid

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
medication with me because
it made such a difference.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It was so precious
to get my brain back,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
to get my energy back,
and this was a part of it.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:10%
In your body, you manufacture
something called T4 hormone.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:10%
And then your liver, your
kidney, your muscles,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:10%
your thyroid gland
convert T4 into T3.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And when your body has T3,
that helps your mitochondria

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:10%
create electricity and ATP.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So T4 and T3 regulate
your metabolic rate.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.715 align:middle line:84%
So the body says
inside the brain,

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:90%
I think I need more energy.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And it asks for the energy
with something called TSH.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:10%
It responds with T4.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:10%
And if everything
works right, T4

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:10%
turns into 23 which then makes
your body have a ton of energy.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, there's a
problem because that T4 that's

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
supposed to turn into T3
turns into a reverse T3 which

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:90%
slows things down.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that means, it's like
you put gas in your car,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
but some of the gas
never goes to the engine,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and you wonder why
it's not working.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And your body, in response
to that, may raise your TSH.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Your body will keep asking
for more and more thyroid

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:90%
until it gets released.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:10%
We can measure TSH.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:10%
It's very affordable.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
line simple thyroid.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.513 align:middle line:84%
If your TSH is above
1, you probably

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
have an energy
problem, and that's

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
why your pants
keep getting tight,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can get that
treated by a doctor

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
or even use some
natural approaches

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:90%
that we'll talk about here.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
just endemic, if you're

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
exposed to toxic mold, if you
eat wheat and commercial dairy

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and lots of other things,
it can cause your body

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
to make antibodies to your
own thyroid which means you

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.237 align:middle line:90%
make less hormone production.

00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:90%
That's called Hashimoto's.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:90%
It's an autoimmune disease.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
If your thyroid is low, brain
fog, depression, fatigue,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and unexplained weight gain.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
low thyroid, it

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter how
much you exercise

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.943 align:middle line:84%
or how few calories you
eat, you will not burn them.

00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons
I couldn't lose weight

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
after a year and a half
of working out six days

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.298 align:middle line:90%
a week for 90 minutes.

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt like a failure.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My thyroid was a
major part of that.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that happens is
if you're on a low calorie diet

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're on an excessive
exercise plan like that,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or if you're on a
long-term Keto diet,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
or if you're over fasting, your
body will lower your T3 levels,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and then your metabolic
rate slows down.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
There are also
environmental toxins

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:84%
that lower thyroid
hormones, things

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
like flame retardance
in your mattress, things

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
like bromine in bread can be
things that lower your thyroid.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're over 40,
your thyroid is already

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
starting to slow down.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You can supplement that
to bring it back up.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Iodine controls your
thyroid function.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a mineral, and most of
us don't get enough iodine.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get it from kelp
powder, which tastes gross.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You can get it from
seafood and eggs.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend supplementing
at a very minimum

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:90%
of 150 micrograms per day.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I take closer to
a milligram a day,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
which is about six
times that amount.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.967 align:middle line:10%
If your health plan will pay
for it or you're ordering online

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:10%
where it's very
affordable, you should

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:10%
ask for TSH, 3 T4, 3 T3, reverse
T3, and thyroid antibodies.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:10%
That's called a
complete thyroid panel.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.595 align:middle line:10%
If the numbers come in and
say, oh, you're within range,

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:10%
but you're at the lower
end for any of those,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:10%
and you have the symptoms
of hypothyroidism,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:10%
it's called subclinical
hypothyroidism.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
That means that especially
if your TSH is slightly

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
elevated, that you
probably will do well

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
on a little bit of
thyroid replacement.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And you should work
with a doctor on that.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I just cannot express how
different It felt when I went

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
my exercise started

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%
making a difference again.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Before, it was this feeling
of helplessness where

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm just tired all the time.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:90%
My career was taking off.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I made and lost $6
million before I was 28,

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and I was never so tired.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I got thyroid
back into my life,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I started losing weight,
but my brain turned on.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a hormone
problem for you.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
You've got to look at it.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're, again, over 40
or even in your 50s or 60s,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, just a little
bit of thyroid hormone

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel young again.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It's an anti-aging
hormone, so get tested.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK to ask your
functional medicine

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
doctor about getting a
prescription for thyroid

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
hormone replacement.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.677 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to find is
that if it works, it's magic.

00:10:31.677 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
make any difference,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.905 align:middle line:90%
then it isn't what you needed.

00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
By now, you're probably
thinking about, well,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%
what about the big hormones--
testosterone, estrogen?

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get there.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But your stress hormones are
affecting your sex hormones,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.083 align:middle line:90%
so let's talk about those first.

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Your adrenal glands
sit above your kidneys.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
They make a majorly important
hormone called cortisol.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've probably heard
that cortisol is stress.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol is a bad hormone.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol regulates blood sugar.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It influences your
memory and learning.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
It controls your
electrolyte balance,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and it plays a big role in
regulating your metabolism.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol is not good or bad.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You really want
well-functioning cortisol.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.578 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it should be high,
sometimes it should be low,

00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
depending on what's
happening in your life.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It's when it's always
high or always low

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that you get into
serious problems.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Chronic low level stress
causes your adrenals

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
to pump out too much cortisol
for long periods of time.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90%
So your body's always tweaked.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:90%
You feel anxiety from cortisol.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, your adrenals
get tired of doing this.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You run out of the
minerals and the cofactors.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And now, your body switches
over to low cortisol.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So you're tired all the
time, and you actually

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
get infections, like viral
infections, sinus infections,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and you don't heal well.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
When you have adrenal
burnout like that,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
it feels like exhaustion,
brain fog, lack of motivation,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and just these really
strong sugar cravings, which

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I definitely used to have.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The most comprehensive test
for cortisol function is called

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the Dutch test, like Dutch
Apple pie, just D-U-T-C-H.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It stands for dried urine test
for comprehensive hormones,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's relatively complex
and relatively expensive,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:90%
but it works.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline is
related to cortisol,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's released when there's
a fight or flight response.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:10%
And when you have too much
adrenaline on a regular basis,

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:10%
it messes with your
digestion because your body

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:10%
isn't going to digest
food when it thinks

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:10%
there's a tiger chasing you.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So all resources go to fight or
flight, not to rest and repair.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And adrenaline will lower
your immune system function.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do you control
cortisol and adrenaline?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, breathwork,
meditation, neurofeedback,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:90%
adaptogenic herbs.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
check out the episode

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:90%
about recovery and resilience.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And on Gaia, you're
in the right place.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
There's so much you
can learn about this.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
You can directly control
your stress response,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
which can help.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But if your adrenals are low,
adding salt or electrolytes

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
containing salts to
your water all day

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
long, especially in the morning,
can make a huge difference.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Adrenal cortex, which is
a supplement you can take,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
can help.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And you might even see a doctor
about cortisol replacement

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
therapy while you get
your adrenals back online.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time for the big guns--
estrogen and progesterone.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, testosterone
is coming next.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Estrogen regulates,
obviously, your monthly cycle,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but it also controls
hunger, insulin sensitivity,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and it helps you metabolize
cholesterol and controls

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
bone density.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And guys, you make
estrogen also.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It helps to regulate
your libido,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and you don't develop
sperm without estrogen.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So estrogen is not a
female or a male hormone,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a human hormone
just like testosterone.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
In women, low estrogen will
cause menopause symptoms,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
changes vaginally, painful sex
and urination, hot flashes,

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
moodiness, irregular periods,
and, this is very important,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:90%
brain fog.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
In those cases, usually,
estrogen dominance

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is the issue, which
is too much estrogen.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And that can even lead to
fibroids, endometriosis,

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, reduced sex
drive, really bad PMS,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
or gaining weight
that just won't

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
respond to the things
that used to work.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
When men have
estrogen dominance,

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
this is something that I
definitely had in my 20s,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%
you get man boobs.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You get erectile dysfunction,
which I was a little concerned

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
about in my 20s, but I am
not concerned about today,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:90%
and infertility.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, for me, I
saw an anti-aging doctor

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
when I was 26 years old, who
got my hormones under control,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
or I wouldn't have
two kids today.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:10%
Estrogen dominance
is common in women

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:10%
due to industrial chemical
hormonal birth control,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:10%
as well as xenoestrogens, things
like parabens, phthalates,

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:10%
benzophenones,
fragrances, pesticides.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's a ton
of things mimicking

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:90%
estrogen in the environment.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:10%
And birth control pills
are the number one cause

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:10%
of hormone
dysregulation in women.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:10%
There are many safe
forms of birth control.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Hormonal birth control,
chemical, industrial pills

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
are not a safe form
of birth control

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:84%
if you want to live a long time
and have functioning hormones.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And then there's your tap water.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The environmental working
group identified 45 hormone

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
disrupting chemicals in
public drinking water,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:90%
including birth control pills.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So these are not good for
the environment or for you.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, you should
drink bottled water,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
except there are estrogenic
chemicals in plastic as well.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So in an ideal world, you
have good filtered water,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and you drink water
out of glass bottles.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But the world isn't
perfect, so you

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
want to watch the
episode on detoxing

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
because you can do something
about those estrogen-like

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
If you have estrogen
dominance, you

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
want to look at
chronic stress and how

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that throws off hormone balance
and learn the stress management

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And you look at progesterone,
which is another hormone that

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
helps regulate menstrual
cycles in women,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and it also helps you
to have bone density.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But in men, progesterone
is necessary

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:90%
for testosterone production.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And progesterone
is neuroprotective.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
It's got a lot of functions in
your central nervous system.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Around myelination,
that insulating

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
layer that goes on every nerve,
even the nerves in your arms

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and your legs, but
especially in your brain,

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
it protects neurons.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It modulates neurons, and it
controls learning, memory,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:90%
and mood.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So progesterone is way more
important than just a sex

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone balances
estrogen. And if you

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough progesterone,
your estrogen can go haywire.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So for men and women,
sometimes, progesterone

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is something that
benefits your brain

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and is a level you want to
get tested on a lab test.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:10%
Another major sex hormone that
we don't hear about very much

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:10%
is something called
pregnenolone,

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and we like to call
that the mother hormone.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a hormone that can
turn into many other hormones.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
So it's a precursor to your
stress hormones and your sex

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
hormones, and it'll go
wherever the demand is.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you take pregnenolone,
it could support adrenals,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
or it could support
testosterone or estrogen.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, pregnenolone
should help

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
you to make progesterone
and just enough cortisol.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
stressed, the body

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:84%
snaps up all that
pregnenolone, and then you

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:90%
don't get the progesterone.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up having
not enough progesterone

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:90%
to balance out your estrogen.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the most famous
sex hormone, testosterone, which

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:90%
has a bad name sometimes.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, this is a
necessary hormone for life.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary for men and
women at different levels.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It regulates sex
differentiation.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It produces male
characteristics,

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's important in
fertility in men and women.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So women with no testosterone
don't have babies.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
that you have enough.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone also
improves your mood.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It improves muscle growth.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a woman taking
normal levels of testosterone,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
whether because you
manufacture them internally

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
or because working
with your doctor,

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you realize you were
low on testosterone,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
so you use a patch
or a cream, if you do

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:90%
that, you will not get bulky.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But in men, we will get
bulky because our levels

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:90%
are very different.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It also stimulates red
blood cell formation.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:90%
That change in mood is dramatic.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It also makes you motivated,
and it makes you confident.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
thyroid earlier.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.625 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid is the
hormone of energy.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:35.375 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone is the
hormone of motivation.

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
You put the two together
in men and women,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and you get people who
will change the world

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:90%
by changing themselves first.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why biohacking
is so important.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
testosterone does in women

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
is it enhances interest
in initiating sex,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and it improves response
to sexual stimulation.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it gives
you better orgasms.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's also associated
with reduced anxiety

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and reduced depression
and increased

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
feelings of well-being.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
In men and women, testosterone
levels decline with age,

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and low testosterone and
women equals low libido.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And birth control messes with
testosterone levels, not just

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:90%
estrogen levels.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone levels
decrease in men, for sure.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:10%
And when we have low
testosterone, reduced

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:10%
sexual activity and
desire, loss of body hair,

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:10%
reduced bone mass, decreased
fertility, decreased energy

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:10%
and motivation, depression,
poor concentration and memory,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:10%
sleep disturbances, muscle
loss, and generally you

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:10%
feel like life sucks and
there's no reason for doing it.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
If You've ever seen the
movie "Grumpy Old Men,"

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty much a documentary
on testosterone deficiency.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go there as
you age as a man or a woman.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Have the hormone levels
of a healthy 30-year-old

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:84%
when you're 130, and you will
very much like your life.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:10%
The problem with things like
progesterone and pregnenolone

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:10%
and estrogen and
testosterone is that it

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:10%
takes a while for a deficiency
or an imbalance to show up.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And besides aging, the main
cause of low testosterone

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
is toxins in the environment.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Men who had the highest amount
of high pesticide produce

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
had 49% lower total
sperm count compared

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
to men who had the least
non-organic produce.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Scientific studies
show a clear link

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
between low fat diets
and plant-based diets

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and lower testosterone in men.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
That may be because plant-based
diets have more pesticides,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
or it could be because
they lack the right fats

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and proteins for men and women.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D levels appear to
increase testosterone levels,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:84%
which means go out in the sun
or take some vitamin D. That's

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
vitamin D, A, K, E
in order to optimize

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:90%
your testosterone levels.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
studies that show

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
testosterone replacement will
improve sexual function, mood,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
muscle function, and
body composition in men.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It does not increase
cancer risk.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It lowers cancer risk
when it's bioidentical

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%
at appropriate doses.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes have this
idea that testosterone

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.692 align:middle line:84%
is bad for you, or you
get testosterone poisoning

00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 1970s, bodybuilders
used synthetic testosterone

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
chemicals that were like
testosterone, but not the same,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and there were media
stories of roid rage and all

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
this crazy stuff.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it works.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
When you use the same hormone
that mother nature designed

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
you to do, and you help mother
nature to put that hormone back

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
in balance, because your
environment took it out

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
of balance, you are someone
who is resilient and powerful.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And who knows what you might do?

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.325 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're
here to biohack.

00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So what did you do to take
control of all these things?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Number one, get your
hormones tested.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Do an advanced hormone panel.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you're young,
get your baseline now.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.277 align:middle line:84%
Because the normal levels
could be very different.

00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So what makes you feel
great when you're 25?

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
If you know that
level, when you're 125,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:90%
you can still have that level.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.255 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
guess, like I did--

00:21:56.255 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I never had healthy
hormones as a kid because

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.213 align:middle line:84%
of environmental toxins
and mold and all the stuff

00:22:00.213 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I've talked about.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So I have guessing at my levels.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But I've got them dialed in
after a lot of just playing

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:90%
around with them.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.928 align:middle line:84%
If you know your
levels because you

00:22:07.928 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
did a test when
you were 25, great.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, you know.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're 35, and
you still feel good.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, you know.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you get tested
at 35, and you realize

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
your thyroid is a little
low and your sex hormones

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.532 align:middle line:84%
are a little
imbalanced, you probably

00:22:21.532 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
can use supplements
and take some iodine.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you wait
until they crash.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
have muffin top,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and your brain doesn't work,
and your hair fallen out,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe you could
have done better.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.512 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot of
stress in your life

00:22:32.512 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and you think you may
have adrenal dysfunction,

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.845 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms I talked about,
you could order a DUTCH test

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:84%
or work with a functional
medicine doctor.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And something that's free,
that's really important,

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
that affects hormones in a way
it's even hard to comprehend

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:90%
is just getting quality sleep.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I did not say sleeping
eight hours a night.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you watch the episode
on sleep because I teach you

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that 6 and 1/2 hours is
probably the right number.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you get enough
deep sleep in the time

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:84%
you sleep, your growth hormones,
your cortisol, your leptin,

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
the hunger hormones,
they all become improved.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So without any
money spent at all,

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:84%
you could just learn how to
get better quality sleep,

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.455 align:middle line:90%
and your hormones will improve.

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You also want to watch
the fitness episode.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in it, I described how
high intensity exercise or even

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
something called reheat
can increase growth hormone

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and testosterone
in men and women

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:90%
without taking a lot of time.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:10%
There's also a role for deep
breathing and mindfulness.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:10%
And you can find that in the
episode on mindfulness here.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:10%
And on Gaia, there's
dozens of things

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:10%
you could learn about
breathing and mindfulness.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Any of them are going to
reduce your excess cortisol

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:90%
and your stress hormones.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
your vitamin DAKE.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D, A, K, E is important
because it contains precursors

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of
testosterone and human growth

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
hormone and estrogen. So
give your body what it needs,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the building blocks
to make your hormones.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It'll work better.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You could consider
ashwagandha and holy basil

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
which are adaptogens that
can improve sex drive

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and reduce stress.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you watch
the nutrition episode

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
because the diet there,
which includes carbohydrates

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and includes saturated fat
and cycling of carbohydrates,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
is shown to improve
testosterone levels.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I'm seeing today.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because intermittent fasting has
become more and more popular,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
is if you're over fasting,
especially for women,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
but it happens to men, too, or
overtraining and under-eating,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
your hormones will
stop working well

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:90%
because your body is stressed.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
If you exercise a lot,
you need to eat a lot.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:90%
And you will not get fat.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
You will not get bulky.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.018 align:middle line:84%
If you start getting fat,
because you're eating a lot

00:24:36.018 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and exercising, then
something else is wrong,

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.587 align:middle line:84%
and you need to figure
out what that is.

00:24:39.587 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:10%
Saturated fat, the kind that
is only found in animals

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:10%
is the building block for all
hormone creation in your body.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Your body can manufacture
some of those,

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's very
difficult. Research

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:84%
shows that male athletes
who eat saturated fat

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and some monounsaturated fat
and eat cholesterol, usually

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in the form of eggs, have
higher testosterone levels.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Runny egg yolks will
increase your testosterone

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
for most people, as long as
you're not allergic to eggs.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Filter your water.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:10%
Get the xenoestrogens out.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Make sure you watch the episode
on detoxing, where I teach you

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:10%
about the triple G detox
protocol that includes

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:10%
calcium-D-glucarate,
glutathione, and glycine,

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:10%
because these help your
body clear extra estrogen.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is a major
way, especially in men,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of not having man boobs.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.915 align:middle line:90%
I do not have man boobs now.

00:25:29.915 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I have had man boobs for
more than half of my life,

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.998 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have to have
any surgery to do it.

00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It's because I manage
my estrogen levels.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It's really nice to
not have man boobs.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me just tell you.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.817 align:middle line:10%
Also, eat organic when you can.

00:25:40.817 --> 00:25:42.150 align:middle line:10%
I didn't say eat organic plants.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:10%
I just said eat organic,
because you need meat

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:10%
to have healthy hormone levels.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:10%
Work with a functional
medicine doctor

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:10%
or a hormone expert for
hormone replacement therapy.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes, that's the
best way to biohack yourself,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
take control of
your own biology.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
When you have control
of your own biology,

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.107 align:middle line:84%
you can build energy in a way
that it's hard to express.

00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
When you have that
energy from your thyroid,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.012 align:middle line:84%
you're like, all right,
I've got the power.

00:26:05.012 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But if you have power
and no desire, who cares?

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.345 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
the testosterone

00:26:08.345 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and in balance with estrogen.
And then I've got the power,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and I've got the desire.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
it's going to give you

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.235 align:middle line:90%
a desire to meditate.

00:26:16.235 --> 00:26:18.193 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give you
a desire to do something

00:26:18.193 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
nice for another person.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give you a
desire to evolve yourself.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
the power, and you

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have the hormones of
desire, everything feels hard.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
That was my life
when I was young,

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:90%
and that is not my life today.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have
this kind of life.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is biohacking.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:90%
