Hi.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dave Asprey, the
father of biohacking.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
The media calls me that because
I started a global movement

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
of biohacking more
than 10 years ago

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:10%
and it's become a new word
in the English language.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'll teach you
about the benefits of fasting,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the different types
of fasting, as well as

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
hacks to make your
fasts more enjoyable

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and to give you more benefits.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important, to make sure

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
that you don't over-fast.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.225 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's entirely possible
to fast too much

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and stress your body
out just like you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
can do the keto diet too much.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
to fast for you, not fast

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
according to some strict
thing that you heard online.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Fasting is important
because it helps

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
you unlock biological
resources hidden in your body.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Your body will only
do certain things

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:90%
when there's no food present.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I want you to learn to
break away from the belief

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that if you skip a
meal, you will actually

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
be in danger of starving or
that you'll be miserable.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I have tried every form of
fasting, and fasting itself

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
just means to go without.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Your body is going to tell
you that you need something,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is
that you just want it.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
The reality is also that you
can likely go for 60 days

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
without food, and
you're not going to die.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet, your body tells
you that if you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.538 align:middle line:84%
don't have tacos in
a half hour, you're

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:90%
going to starve to death.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, there's a mismatch.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Intermittent fasting puts you
in charge of your own desires.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Fasting is not about suffering,
and intermittent fasting

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is different than
longer term fasting.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
What you get when
you fast is you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
get regulation of
your insulin levels.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
High insulin levels are
linked to higher risk

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
of dying from all causes.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
When you have more energy coming
into your body than going out,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
your body will turn glucose
into fat and then store it.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Your pancreas becomes
overworked and your body

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:90%
becomes insulin-resistant.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a study in 2018 that
found that time-restricted

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:90%
feeding--

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
intermittent fasting--

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
improved insulin sensitivity.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It lowered insulin levels
compared to eating in a normal

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:90%
12-hour-a-day window.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Experimental and control groups
ate exactly the same amount

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
of calories.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
People have been
telling you calories in

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and calories out is how
you lose weight forever,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
but here, we had two groups
of people eating exactly

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the same things, just
shifting when they ate them,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and they got different results.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So this study alone
absolutely destroys that story

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that you have heard
your entire life,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.305 align:middle line:84%
that the amount of calories you
eat determines how fat you are.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
that determine that,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and the number of calories is
not that important compared

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to these other variables.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
One thing that fasting does
is it triggers autophagy.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:90%
What is autophagy?

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is your
body's process

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of finding the weak
cells that need replacing

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and then replacing them.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like a team who
would go through Las Vegas

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and unscrew all the light bulbs
that were dimming or almost out

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and then replacing them
with new light bulbs.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You want to do this
throughout your body

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
so you can stay
young and strong,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and you won't actually
turn on autophagy

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating breakfast,
lunch, and dinner seven days

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:90%
a week forever.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that
triggering autophagy

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.763 align:middle line:84%
helps to slow down aging
and it reduces inflammation.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you
might have heard about

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is NAD, which is an
anti-aging supplement.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Intermittent fasting
increases your levels of NAD.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
NAD is a major
anti-aging molecule

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
that repairs DNA damage, keeps
your proteins properly shaped,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and it protects your cells
from oxidative stress.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Another study out of
MIT showed 24 hours

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
of fasting improved stem cell
regeneration, and fasting also

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
improves your microbiome,
the number and type

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of bacteria in your gut.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
When bacteria are
deprived of food,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
they make something called
FIAF, Fasting-Induced Adipose

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Factor, which is a hormone that
tells your body to stop storing

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
fat and start burning fat.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
by strategically skipping

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
some meals at the
right time, you

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
can tell your gut
bacteria to tell your body

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to burn more fat, and
that's super cool.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Fasting's also good
for your brain.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
In animal studies, intermittent
fasting increases memory.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It increases learning.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It increases growth of new
neurons in your hippocampus.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
A major fasting
researcher at USC

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
named Valter Longo showed
that fasting decreases

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
biochemical markers
for diabetes,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular
disease, and cancer.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Those are the big
three things that

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:90%
are likely to take you out.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Skipping breakfast could
reduce your risk of that?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.755 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But fasting isn't
a new thing either.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors fasted
often, and they did this

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.972 align:middle line:84%
because they were
opportunistic eaters

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
have refrigerators.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.638 align:middle line:84%
So there were times when
there either wasn't any food

00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:90%
or there wasn't much food.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the food was gone,
they hunted for more food,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and they ate the
few nontoxic plants

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that they could eat
as a way to fill

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
in the spaces between
high-nutrient animal meals.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
They were hungry,
but they were fine

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
going a few days with
less food or without food,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
just like you and
I actually can be.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So humans have
feasted and fasted

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
for we think about
290,000 years,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably
more than that.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we
learned how to farm,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and you could have
a meal every day.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
You could have
three of them a day.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Industrial Revolution did.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The people who ran
the factories decided

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that it would be very
efficient if everyone

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
ate on the same schedule.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And since they wanted
us to work 12 hour days,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
you'd have breakfast, go to
work, have your lunch hour,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
go to work, have your
dinner, and maybe go home

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:90%
or go to work again.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Same schedule for
everyone, regardless

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.545 align:middle line:84%
of whether your body
needed food then,

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what you
ate in your last meal,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
regardless of whether
you were hungry.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Social structures
and the food industry

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
have reinforced that so that you
eat on a clock, on a calendar,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and your hunger
isn't important, even

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
though it's the primary signal
of whether you need food.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
almost every world religion

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
includes fasting.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Jesus fasted for 40 days
and 40 nights in the desert.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Catholics fast during Lent.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Jews fast on Yom Kippur.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Fasting is a
cornerstone of Ramadan.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So why are we doing all of
these things if it's bad for us?

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's about you having control
over your own biology,

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
for you being in charge
of what your body does

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
instead of your body telling
you what you have to do.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You can achieve different
levels of consciousness

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:90%
when you're fasting as well.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
There is such a thing
as a spiritual fast,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's such a
thing as a working fast.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So fasting done in
the right way can

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
improve your mental
performance, and fasting

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
done in an entirely
different way

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
can improve your awareness
of the world around you.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But you might not want to do
a spiritual fast in the middle

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of a high-pressure
workday because it's not

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
going to work very well.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
What I want you
to do is to start

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
with a 16-hour fast,
which sounds really scary,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:90%
except what does that mean?

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
slightly early dinner, dinner

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
at 6 o'clock, and then
you don't eat a snack

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:90%
before you go to bed.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up at 6:00
AM the next morning.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:90%
That was 12 hours.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So you need to wait until
10:00 AM to have breakfast.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.315 align:middle line:84%
You can put breakfast
off for a couple hours

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and have an earlier dinner.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.240 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You did a 16-hour fast.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Just a 16-hour fast
done three times a week

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
can help you become
metabolically flexible.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that a 24-hour
fast can increase your growth

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
hormone levels so you get fat
loss and more tissue healing.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But I do want you to be
cautious with longer fasts going

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:90%
beyond 24 hours.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that those are
beneficial for high blood

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
pressure, and they can
amplify the effectiveness

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy in
cancer patients.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you have certain
health problems,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
it could weaken your heart or
suppress your immune system.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.390 align:middle line:84%
For most of us, though, you
can do up to a three-day

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
fast once you've learned
how your body feels

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.050 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be all right.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you don't
hear about in a lot of books

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
on fasting is the fact
that your body stores

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:90%
a ton of toxins in your fat.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are
man-made toxins.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are toxins that
come from your digestion.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you melt a lot of fat
with intermittent fasting,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
all those toxins get
released, and that's

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
why I want you to take activated
charcoal when you're fasting,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
especially if you go
over a 24-hour fast.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that happens
when you fast is your body

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
starts to lose minerals, and
minerals are the cornerstone

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:90%
of how your body makes energy.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to include
minerals during your fast.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to do this
is to drink black coffee

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:90%
with added minerals.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Normal coffee doesn't
have minerals.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You can also add sea salt
or electrolyte powder

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
as long as there's no sugar and
no protein in it to whatever

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
you're drinking during
a fast, and then

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
your fast becomes easier
to do, and you don't

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:90%
become depleted in minerals.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And if those
electrolytes in your body

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
fall too low when you're
fasting, you can get sick.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You could even require
hospitalization.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to fast for
more than probably five days,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but certainly more than
10 days, you really

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
want to have a doctor
supervising you

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
because if your sodium and
potassium levels get off,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:90%
you can have problems.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But that pinch of salt in
water can change everything.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.075 align:middle line:84%
You want to break your fast
with an anti-inflammatory meal.

00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Some part of you is
going to be tempted

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, I just fasted for
the first time for 24 hours.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll go have
nachos, pizza, and beer,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and that's not how to do it.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You want to give yourself
high-nutrient foods

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
so your body can go in and
rebuild the systems that it's

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
still rebuilding.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I also want you to regularly
change the duration and style

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.095 align:middle line:90%
of your fast.

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
If you do the same
fast every single day,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
the body just gets used to it.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
If some days you go longer, some
days you don't fast at all, you

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:90%
maintain metabolic flexibility.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I make it a point to at
least once, and sometimes

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
two or three times a
week, have breakfast,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have breakfast with
my kids on a Saturday morning.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I do that very specifically
because I want my body

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to not count on there always
being or always not being

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:90%
food at any one time.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.432 align:middle line:84%
It makes me a
stronger human being.

00:10:59.432 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
intermittent fasting

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
does for you is
it makes your body

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
stronger by helping you
cycle in and out of lipolysis

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:90%
and ketosis.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Lipolysis is fat burning
mode and ketosis is using

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
fat to make energy in the body.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:10%
Even a 12-hour intermittent
fast three times

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:10%
a week can slightly raise
your ketosis levels,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:10%
but I like it if you
can get up to 16 hours

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:10%
at least three times a week.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:10%
Your body loves
consistency, and it

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:10%
wants to make you do
less work to survive

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:10%
in a world that's consistent.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So your job is to send
that signal to your body

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that the world just
isn't consistent,

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and that way your body will
reconfigure and rebuild

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
itself to thrive in that world,
and that makes you a biohacker.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to sit down and
think about a fasting window.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Pick a schedule that
makes sense to you

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and that you can sustain.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
If you have a really
intense Monday,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's not the day to
start intermittent fasting.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But once you learn how
to intermittent fast,

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you will probably
realize like most people

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.353 align:middle line:84%
that skipping breakfast
gives you more mental focus

00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
than eating
breakfast, and you may

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:90%
decide that's your fasting day.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to learn
how your body feels.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you can do
that changes everything is you

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
can finish eating before
the sun goes down.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.525 align:middle line:84%
And this can be
hard to do if you

00:12:17.525 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
live in the far north in
winter, but do your best to have

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
an earlier dinner,
and that alone

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
can change how much
weight you lose

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and how hungry you
are the next day.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And some people say you can
only have water during a fast

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because mice only had water
in this study or that study,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:90%
but that's not how it works.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
There are things you can
take during your fast

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that will radically
reduce your hunger

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and make it very easy,
as in painless, to fast.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
For example,
there's three things

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
you can have during a fast
that make it easier to fast.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
One of them is black
coffee with minerals.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, especially if
the coffee doesn't have mold

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
in it, you're going to
find that magically,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:90%
you just feel better.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
the amount of caffeine

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:84%
in two small cups
of coffee doubles

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
your production of
ketones since one

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
happens when you fast is,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:90%
well, your body makes ketones.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It starts burning fat.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might as well
double its ability to do that.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why black coffee
during a fast is amazing.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
you could do is you

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
could add a little bit of butter
or ghee along with C8 MCT oil

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:90%
into your high-mineral coffee.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you blend that
together for 20 seconds,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that you feel very
different during your fast.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And some people say,
but there's calories.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
As we already know, not all
calories do the same things.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Fat calories do
not raise insulin

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and they don't raise the other
compound called mTOR that gets

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:90%
raised when you eat.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So a way of giving your
body a little boost of

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
ketosis so that it
feels really good.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.283 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired by a
trip to Tibet right

00:13:58.283 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
as I was at the beginning
of creating the biohacking

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd already lost the 100
pounds that I've lost,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
but my health wasn't where it
is today, and I went to Tibet.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was at 18,000 feet
elevation and decided

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.230 align:middle line:90%
to go on what's called a kora.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a 26-mile walk
around the holiest mountain

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:90%
It's very remote.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes about five days
in a four-wheel drive

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:90%
even to get to this mountain.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling really bad.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It was 10 degrees below zero.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:90%
My knee was hurting.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I've had three surgeries on it.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
My energy was flagging,
and I honestly

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
didn't know if I was
going to make it.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was past tourist season,
so there were only 10 people

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:90%
on the whole mountain.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:10%
Not the best situation to be in.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I went into
a little mud hut,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and a woman maybe
half my height gave me

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.690 align:middle line:90%
a bowl of yak butter tea.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
first time I had it.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard about
it, but what is it?

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's tea blended
with yak butter.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I drank it, and about
five minutes later it

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was like someone
turned on the lights.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I felt better than
I had in months,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.717 align:middle line:84%
even though I was at
a high enough altitude

00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
where my brain shouldn't
have been working at all.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had this amazing
sense of wonder.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Instead of wanting to
just lay down and gasp,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I kind of wanted to dance.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused me
to come back and test butter

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and MCT oil in tea and coffee
to find a recipe that would

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:90%
turn my brain on that way.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
fasting, if you

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
turn your brain on by putting
some grass-fed butter, C8 MCT

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:84%
oil, and coffee
together, blending it

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
for at least 20 seconds,
you will absolutely just not

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:90%
think about food.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.675 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the day, you're like,

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I just went 24 hours
because I skipped lunch,

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't think about it.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that 1/3 of the
thoughts most people have

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
every day are about,
what's for lunch?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you turned
those thoughts off.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What else would your
brain be thinking about?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Probably something more
useful for you and the world

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So get your grass-fed butter
or ghee, some C8 MCT oil,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and some coffee full of
trace minerals and no mold,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and blend them together
for at least 20 seconds,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and you will not
believe the difference

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:90%
in the quality of your day.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the other reasons
that that recipe works

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
so well during a fast is
that ketones provide energy.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
They help to regulate
your circadian

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
rhythm, which makes it easier
to go to sleep at night.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Ketones stimulate
something called

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
CCK, which is a hormone that
tells you to stop eating,

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and they turn off
ghrelin production,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and ghrelin's the one
that says, I'm hungry.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, that
little cup of special coffee

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that's blended together has
this profound effect on you.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And then fasting went from
being hard to being easy,

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and you were more focused,
and your brain was happier.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:10%
MCT oil itself converts
into ketones in your body.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:10%
And since caffeine
doubles ketone production,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:10%
it's almost like you're on the
second day of a fast instead

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:10%
of the first day
because you accelerated

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:10%
the benefits of fasting.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This idea absolutely
does anger the fasting

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
purists who believe you must
suffer through a water-only

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.860 align:middle line:84%
That is simply not how it works
when you look at the science.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
things fasting does

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is fasting puts stress
on your gut bacteria.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
When your gut
bacteria get stressed,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
they make an endotoxin called
LPS, or Lipopolysaccharide,

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that causes brain fog and
systemic inflammation.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's so important to
take a little bit of activated

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
charcoal during your fast.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:10%
Activated charcoal extends
lifespan in animal studies

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:10%
and it sticks to that LPS toxin.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:10%
But excessive fasting can
knock out good gut bacteria

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:10%
because if they
don't have anything

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:10%
to eat for a long period
of time, they'll go away.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So what can you do
during an extended

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
fast to maintain good
gut bacteria, or even

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
during an intermittent fast?

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
You would use prebiotic
soluble fiber powders

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
like acacia gum, guar gum,
or large arabinogalactan.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
These are available in
prebiotic supplements,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and those can help you
maintain a healthy gut

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
lining during a fast.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't digest them,
but your microbiome can.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It breaks those fibers
into ketogenic fats

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.295 align:middle line:84%
that suppress hunger, and
it doesn't break a fast.

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if you put
prebiotic fiber in your coffee

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
along with butter and MCT
oil and you blended it up?

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be
hungry and you would

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
reduce your risk of
all sorts of things,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and you'd save time and
money in the morning as well.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons that
intermittent fasting has just

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
taken off because
it works that well,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and the pain is gone when
you have those fasting hacks.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
There's another kind of
fast that I've taught about,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.405 align:middle line:90%
and it's called protein fasting.

00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you still
eat, but one day per week

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.002 align:middle line:84%
you have less than 15
grams of protein in total.

00:18:56.002 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
That's because one of the things
you do when you're fasting

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is you lower insulin levels
and you lower a compound

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:90%
called mTOR.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:10%
mTOR is a compound that tells
your body, it's time to grow,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:10%
so it'll grow muscles
and things like that.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you always have
protein and always

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
have carbohydrate, which is
the biggest increaser of mTOR,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
then your body's
always in grow mode,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're much more
likely to eventually get

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.402 align:middle line:90%
cancer or inflammation.

00:19:20.402 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
intermittent fasting

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is you suppress mTOR when
you're intermittent fasting,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and then when you
eat, eat good protein,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and then you have good results.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's so
under-talked about in the world

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
of fasting is that what
you ate in the meal

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
before determines how hard
your fast is going to be.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Low-quality foods,
plant-based meat substitutes,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and all of the chemicals,
omega 6 fats, a lot of grains,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.430 align:middle line:84%
even a lot of natural
inflammatory things

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
cause your body to have
cravings after you eat.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you find a
fast is unbearable,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
eating something that

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't work for your biology
in the meals before it.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for the
rest of your life,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
if you feel hungry
before three or four

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
hours after your last meal,
it's because you ate kryptonite,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
or it's because you just
didn't eat enough food.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
You didn't eat enough
fat or enough protein.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you just didn't
have enough energy in it.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
This is especially
a problem for women.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women are just
eating very small meals,

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
but they're working out
like professional athletes.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you exercise a lot,
you actually need more food.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat too little
and exercise too much,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:90%
you will hold on to fat.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
The number of people
who've realized, wow,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
if I eat more and
exercise less I

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
lose weight, yeah,
that can happen.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
can also over-fast.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So as you're going
through all of this,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
understand you don't have
to fast every single day.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it might not
even be good for you.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
more technical,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you could test
your ketone levels

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to see how well your fast
is putting you in ketosis

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.265 align:middle line:90%
if you're trying to lose weight.

00:20:56.265 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can get a little meter
that takes a drop of blood

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:90%
and measures it.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:10%
The magic number is 0.48
millimoles per liter

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:10%
in order to know
you're in ketosis.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
What you will find if you have
a metabolism like most people

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
is that one cup of that
high-mineral coffee

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
blended with butter and MCT
oil can raise your ketones

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:90%
to that level.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people also ask, what
about exercise and fasting?

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Should I exercise
when I've fasted?

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:90%
What does the timing look like?

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get more
benefits from exercise

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:84%
if you start with a mild
fast before you exercise

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you break
the fast right

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:90%
after you finish exercising.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this is
that if you're fasting,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:90%
it suppresses mTOR.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
If you drink coffee,
it suppresses mTOR.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you exercise,
it suppresses mTOR.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, mTOR is that compound
that wants your body to build.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So when it's really,
really suppressed,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
then after the exercise, you
immediately have some protein,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
some fat, and
probably some carbs

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.405 align:middle line:90%
unless you're on a keto diet.

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Then magically, the mTOR
levels just explode.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, you
put on muscles more quickly

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
than if you had
exercised and not eaten

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the fast.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
long-term endurance events

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:90%
when you're fasted.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
That's just very
stressful on the body.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a mix
of ketones and glucose

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:90%
for something like that.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
that after you exercise,

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
your body's primed to
repair and build muscle,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and you need to eat.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:10%
If you don't eat
after you exercise,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:10%
especially fasted exercise,
you will get a 48-hour rise

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:10%
in cortisol.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why you'll
never see me exercise

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and then not eat afterwards.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm on a long three-day
fast, I don't exercise.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll go for a walk, but I'm
not going to lift stuff.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
You might be able to do it.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It might even feel
good to do that.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it feels good is
that your body is pumping out

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline and cortisol in
ways that are not good for you.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:90%
So be kind to yourself.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Fasting is a stressor.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.127 align:middle line:90%
Exercise is a stressor.

00:23:00.127 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
stack those things,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:90%
have a steak when you're done.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Have some eggs.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that's interesting

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
is that raising insulin
and raising something

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
called IGF, which is
Insulin-like Growth Factor,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
equals building more muscle.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, you fasted
and you exercised.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You ate protein, and this time
you ate carbs with the protein.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:90%
More insulin, more muscle.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So mTOR and insulin
equals muscle,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want high
mTOR and high insulin

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
all the time because
that equals cancer.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The magic number is within 30
minutes of an intense workout,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
you want protein.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you can have it before
that, it's even better.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
really important for you,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.862 align:middle line:84%
when you're fasting,
whether it's an intermittent

00:23:40.862 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
fast or especially a
longer fast, go for a walk,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:84%
just a 20-minute short
walk, dealing in sunshine,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
ideally without
sunglasses on so that you

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:84%
get some natural
lighting into your body.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:10%
And the reason you go for a walk
is that lymphatic circulation's

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:10%
important, and your
body can't remove

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:10%
lymph, which is part of
your waste removal system,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:10%
without your muscles
being activated.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So walking or maybe jumping
on a little trampoline,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
but something that mixes
that up because you're

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.912 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of more
toxins during a fast.

00:24:09.912 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to
just lay on a couch.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
best way to do it.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happens
if you're doing a longer fast

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
especially is that you may
have a spiritual experience

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't plan on.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.795 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself permission
to experience that.

00:24:25.795 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
find joy in fasting.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And fasting just isn't about
overcoming or battling pain.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about noticing the
signals from your body

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and then noticing how absurd
it is that your body is just

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
screaming for food when
you know that you have

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
two months of no food
before you would die,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and that you are in
zero risk of dying,

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:90%
but it really feels like that.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And just realize, I
wonder what else my body

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:90%
is lying to me about?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you know that
skipping hamburgers at lunch

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:84%
is simply not important,
but it feels so important.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So a physical fast is going to
cleanse the body of chemical

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
impurities, but a
spiritual fast can

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
help cleanse your consciousness
of emotional baggage,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:90%
especially around food.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We all have-- we call
them spiritual toxins.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've been programmed
that if we don't have food,

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
our body will go into starvation
mode, which is why people

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:90%
justified seven meals a day.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And starvation to your body
means you're going to die.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us,
including me, have learned

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
to eat when we're lonely.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The reason I know so
much about fasting

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
is that I decided I was
going to face these head on.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So I hired a shaman to
drop me off in a cave,

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and I fasted for four days
with no people and no food

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
so that even if
I had a meltdown,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.807 align:middle line:84%
it would be something
I could deal with.

00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
allows me to talk

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
about fasting both as
a spiritual practice

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and as a biochemical
practice as a biohacker.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
things you can do

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
is keep a journal to
record your observations.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that you're
good at intermittent fasting

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
before you do a
longer spiritual fast.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:90%
This is also really important.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Women are not little
men, and nature

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
wants to protect women's
bodies as a safe space

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.665 align:middle line:90%
for having babies.

00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to think about that.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.123 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:26:28.123 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what your cells do when
you're not paying attention.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So daily intermittent
fasting can pose a challenge,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:90%
especially for women.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Women and men usually
need different amounts

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.950 align:middle line:90%
of intermittent fasting.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And a low-fat diet
or over-fasting

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:84%
can cause epigenetic
changes and chemical

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:84%
changes that tell your
body, there is a famine.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't reproduce.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So for women, it's
a good practice

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to do intermittent
fasting every other day,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and to do it with butter,
trace mineral-rich coffee,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and MCT oil.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And those fats tell your body
that there is not a famine,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
there's enough energy, so that
the stress response is lower.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And on the days where you're
not doing intermittent fasting,

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
make sure you have protein
and fat in the morning.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You could just add collagen
into your coffee with the oils

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
and you would see a difference.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Some women do very well
eating normally all week long

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and just doing one
24-hour fast per week.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So maybe Wednesday, you
just don't eat on Wednesday.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It sounds impossible,
but check this out.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:84%
You have an early
dinner on Tuesday night.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Wednesday, you skip breakfast.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Have your coffee with butter,
MCT, and your minerals.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And then lunch comes around
and you say, you know,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll skip lunch.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:90%
And then you have dinner.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:90%
You actually went 24 hours.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You just had to skip two
meals one day a week.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And women also do
better with more carbs

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:90%
than men do on a daily basis.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And another thing.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:10%
If you are or think
you might be pregnant,

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:10%
that is not when
you want to fast.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:10%
That is when you create a
high-nourishment environment

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:10%
for babies.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a woman who
is either in menopause

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
or in perimenopause, your
body's response to fasting

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:90%
could be very different.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
After menopause, you'll
probably do very well

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:90%
on intermittent fasting.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
In perimenopause, try
shorter intermittent fasts,

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.088 align:middle line:84%
and don't do them
back to back until you

00:28:20.088 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
know they're working
for you because things

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
can change on a weekly basis.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And while you're at it, if
you're having a hard time

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
intermittent fasting,
you want to see a doctor

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and get your hormone levels
and your thyroid levels tested.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And recent research shows
intermittent fasting increases

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
something called
kisspeptin, which

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:84%
is a peptide that stimulates
ovaries and adrenals to make

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:90%
estrogen and progesterone.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And that can actually help
to ease perimenopause.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's great,
but if it doesn't work

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
you need to shift things up.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple other kinds
of fasts that are possible.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Fasting means to go without.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So you could try the
more spiritual types

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:84%
of fast, a dopamine fast, which
is when you fast from anything

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that's stimulating for
a day or a couple days,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:84%
whether it's social media,
whether it's spicy foods,

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:90%
even from people.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just slowing down so
that everything is calm.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You can also fast from
hate, a whole day where

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
hate anyone or anything.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the hardest
spiritual fasts you can do.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing I want
you to take away from this

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is the fasting trap, which
is the same as the keto trap.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the same as the vegan trap.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that if
something works well,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:90%
absolutely more must be better.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We are wired as human beings
to know if something's good,

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:90%
always double down on that.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Fasting is not like that.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:90%
The keto diet is not like that.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
If something works, you need
to use the right amount of it

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn
to be flexible.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no need
to judge yourself

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't make a
fast that you had as a goal

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:84%
or because you did something
you didn't plan to do.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.375 align:middle line:90%
Just be flexible.

00:29:57.375 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
becoming too rigid,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
you can actually go
on a perfection fast,

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:90%
which is one of my favorites.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
deliberately go without fasting

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even eat something
that you know isn't perfect.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And you show yourself
and you show your body,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to die if
you don't fast perfectly.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.492 align:middle line:90%
I want you to fast your way.

00:30:18.492 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you fast this way,
what you're going to find

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
is that, you know what?

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Today I thought I
was going to fast,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but I really don't
feel that good.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have breakfast.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
So you can't fail at fasting.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a constant experiment
based on, how tired am I?

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
How much did I work out?

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:90%
How stressed am I?

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.455 align:middle line:90%
What does my day look like?

00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You are learning as a
biohacker to choose the foods

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and when to eat them
so that you always

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:84%
feel like you have more than
whatever it takes to handle

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
what life is bringing your way.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
