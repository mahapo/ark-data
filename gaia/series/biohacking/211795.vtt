>> Biohacking.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
being well, it's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
about being more than well.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is Biohacking.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
I've written a "New
York Times" best

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:10%
selling science book about
improving brain function,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:10%
and I run a neuroscience
company that increases

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
people's mental performance.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
I will teach you

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
how to make your brain work
better than it normally does

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and how to fight against the
types of brain inflammation

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to
cognitive decline.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
You can be directly in control
of how much focus you have.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn this because I
had a very successful career

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
in Silicon Valley in my 20s.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I ended up buying
disability insurance

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
because I was so tired and I
couldn't remember anything,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and no doctor could
tell me what was wrong.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So I became very serious about
hacking my brain to the point

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that I decided I would get
my MBA at Wharton while I

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:90%
was working full time.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And I started failing
out of my classes.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, maybe
I'm not trying hard enough.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
So I tried even harder.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
to myself, maybe

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not as smart
as all of my classmates.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a really
scary time for me.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The brain fog was so intense
that I could bite my cheek,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I could try to pay
attention, and I would just

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
watch the things I
was trying to learn,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
things I cared about
just disappear.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And when it came
time to take a test,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I would just score
0 on some questions.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't bring it.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was ashamed of it
to be perfectly honest.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a psychiatrist,
and I read a book

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
about changing your
brain and changing

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:90%
your life by Dr. Daniel Amen.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was a book
about the spect scan.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up drinking
some radioactive sugar

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and doing a scan of my brain
while I tried to pay attention.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked into
the psychiatrist's office,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
he clearly thought
I was a guy trying

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to get some Adderall
so I could maybe

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
get through business school.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a common
thing people do.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:90%
That's not good for you.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't my goal.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.858 align:middle line:84%
When you saw my
brain scan, he just

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
said, "Dave, inside your
brain is total chaos.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
You have the best camouflage
of anyone I've ever seen.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you're
standing here in front of me."

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so
validated because that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
was the moment that I understood
that I wasn't a moral failure.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't dumb.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I was actually dealing
with a hardware problem.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
There were pieces
of my brain that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
had been damaged by toxic
mold and by poor sleep

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and by lifestyle and eating the
wrong things, all of the things

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I was doing wrong.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And what it led to was
that I had no blood

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
flow in my prefrontal cortex,
the part of your brain

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that is responsible for
cognitive behavior and decision

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:90%
making.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%
There was just no energy.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to bring
it on an exam or at work,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how
hard I try, it doesn't

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.037 align:middle line:84%
work because trying isn't
what makes the brain work.

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the brain
doesn't even like to try.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It likes to save energy.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this led me to experiment
with cognitive-enhancing

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceuticals and
natural substances

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
with electrical stimulation
across my brain.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And to record this for you
with all the knowledge you're

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
getting here today, I spent
six months with the electrodes

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
glued to my brain, seeing
what my brain was doing,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
consciously control it.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Each week of doing
that is the equivalent

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
of doing 20, 30, 40 years of
daily meditation practice.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So I can run eight companies,
I can record this for you,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I can write book after book
because I upgraded my brain.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I fixed the problems,
and then I went beyond.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to understand
you can do this too.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to spend
$1 million the way I did.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Most of that was hacking
and figuring it out.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
You can do this because
we know what works.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is an absolute
summary of the things

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:90%
you can do with your brain.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
And I know it works
because 10 years later, I

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
saw Dr. Amen again and ended up
joining his board of directors.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.455 align:middle line:90%
And my brain was healed.

00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:27.255 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.522 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:10%
There are two things that
are going to control most

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:10%
of what happens in your brain.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:10%
One of them is how much
energy does your brain make,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:10%
and we'll get into that
mitochondrial connection

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:10%
in a minute.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
is neuroplasticity,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
which is, how much
can your brain change?

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Now both of these are
very recent in the history

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of science.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Starting in the '90s,
we really acknowledged

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that your brain can change.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Before that, they would
teach you in medical school

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that your brain was born
with the same number of cells

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
it would die with and that it
couldn't change whatsoever.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
That is just wrong,
but some people still

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:90%
believe that even today.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We know now which
hormones and signals

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
cause BDNF and NGF, two of
the things inside the brain

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to create a younger,
more neuroplastic brain.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can do
that, you will have

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
a brain that is better
than average for someone

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:90%
no matter what age you are.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you can make more
energy in your brain,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
you will have a brain
that is willing to do more

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and can do more than
it could before.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a major
problem because right

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
now between age 30 and 70,
the average mitochondrial

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
performance decreases
by about 50%.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you're 25 or 30,
you put a gram of food

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
into a mitochondria, it'll
make X amount of energy.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
You put that same gram of
food in 25 years later,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
it'll make half as
much energy unless you

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
hack your energy production,
which is something

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:90%
that you absolutely can do.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Every one of the
episodes in this series

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:90%
is designed to help you do that.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a little problem though,
if mitochondrial performance

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
goes down with age,
well, it turns out

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
50% of people under age 30
have early onset mitochondrial

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:90%
dysfunction.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.648 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that you may
have old energy in your brain

00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
even though you're young.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting worse
because of pesticide, because

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of these plant-based
fats that are

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.897 align:middle line:90%
replacing animal-based fats.

00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And people are trying
to do the right thing,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
they're just not doing
something that's working.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So you may be one of the
50% of people under 30 or 40

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
who has a brain that's older,
and you may just be older

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and have an older brain.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
your brain doesn't

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:90%
make enough electricity?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, you have brain weaknesses.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You forget stuff
the way I used to.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You have these profound
cravings you can't explain.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.917 align:middle line:84%
You open the refrigerator and
don't know why you opened it.

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:10%
You go to the store
and can't remember

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:10%
what you wanted to buy.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You put the car keys somewhere
that they don't belong.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
You cannot focus when
you want to focus.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
You have low energy
when you don't

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
want to have low energy or and
this is maybe the worst thing

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that I experienced is
moodiness and anger.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
When your brain doesn't
have enough electricity,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
you just don't
have enough energy

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:90%
to catch a negative emotion.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Your kid says something
and it pushes a button.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you were at
your full power,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
you would take a deep breath and
say, that's not how we do it.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But instead you snap
and you yell, and then

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.717 align:middle line:84%
you feel bad about yourself
and you apologize ideally.

00:07:37.717 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, what happened there?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.717 align:middle line:84%
What happened is you
didn't have enough energy

00:07:40.717 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
to make the right
decision to catch it.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So your job is to
have enough energy

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to handle anything that
life brings your way,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
whether it's some
ridiculous rule that

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:90%
just got imposed on you.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.418 align:middle line:84%
And instead of freaking out and
going into trauma you actually

00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
say, here's how I'm
going to deal with that

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
or being triggered.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
When your brain
is at full power,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
you cannot be triggered
because you're in charge.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
When your brain is weak,
you are easy to trigger

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
have the energy it

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
takes to just feel the
emotion and then make

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:90%
the right decision.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you feel the emotion,
then you become reactive.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's not your fault. It's
because your brain didn't

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:90%
have the energy.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But it is up to you to make
sure your brain has that energy

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.343 align:middle line:84%
Your first step is to address
the biohacking basics.

00:08:27.343 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at
things like nutrition,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:10%
there's an episode on
that; things like hormones,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:10%
there's an episode
on that; and things

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:10%
like toxins and
detoxing, there's

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:10%
another episode on that.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:10%
All of those affect
mitochondrial function

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:10%
which affects your brain.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:10%
Your nervous system
is made up of neurons,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:10%
and your neurons are
powered by mitochondria.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Mitochondria are
these ancient bacteria

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:10%
that are embedded in our cells.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.502 align:middle line:10%
They serve as
environmental sensors.

00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And once they figure
out what's going on,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
then they make electricity or
they make neurotransmitters

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:90%
or they make hormones.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're manufacturing
plants, not just batteries.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But your neurons have
about 15,000 mitochondria

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:84%
in each one, but
normal cells might just

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:90%
have a couple hundred.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So neurons are like these super
powered cells in the brain.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And they form networks
with each other.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
All of your mitochondria
talk to each other.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
They vote, and they have this
rich social life, which makes

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:90%
them a collective intelligence.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's distributed.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, your neurons do the
same thing between each other.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And something really interesting
happens, your mitochondria

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
decide what's going on
in the world around you

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
before you get a signal
of what's going on.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
That means that your sense of
hearing, of taste, of vision,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
all of these things a signal
gets into the body, the body

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
does something to the signal,
it basically summarizes it,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and then it gives it
to your brain later.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
We can measure
something called P300.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lag time
between when you hear a sound

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and when your brain gets
the first electrical signal

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:90%
that there's a sound.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Most people by the time they're
in their 30s, it's about a 1/3

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:90%
of a second.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
When you're 18, it's about
a quarter of a second.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
when I clap my hands,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
it feels like you
heard it right away.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But if we're
measuring your brain,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
your body picked up
the signal, and then it

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
showed it to your brain
a 1/3 of a second later.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.578 align:middle line:84%
And your brain edits
out that lag time.

00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So neither you nor
I can perceive it,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:90%
but we can measure it.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:90%
So, what's going on there?

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, mitochondrial
function and brain training

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:90%
are things that actually work.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you turn up your
mitochondrial energy,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
you can have a better
view of reality.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying that
is you become more conscious.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondria,
including the ones

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:84%
in your brain and
the neurons they're

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
your organs of
perception of the world.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
When you boil down
all of the things that

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
are based on mitochondria,
they're at the very foundation.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Make those guys
stronger, and you

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
can become more conscious
of everything in the world

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
more quickly.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That means that when you want
to apply energy to focus,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:90%
you have the energy to focus.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
When you want to go into an
altered state via breathwork

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
or meditation or neurofeedback,
all the different ways you

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
can do it, you can more
easily access those states.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do it because
you have the power

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:90%
to access those states.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So running around
with a brain that's

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
at 50% of its possible
power is entirely possible.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you turn that
power up via the things

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
we just talked about, via all
of the different biohacks,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
it's unimaginable what
your brain is capable of.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can see straight
through reality,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and you can do it in a
way that makes you choose

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
to be kind to other people.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why biohacking
is so important to me.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that you do
turn up energy in your brain,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
you also want a brain
that can change,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that can adapt to
reality, in fact, it

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
can change in the ways
you want it to change.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:10%
So that means turn
up energy, and then

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:10%
turn up neuroplasticity.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that there
are multiple things that

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:10%
determine neurogenesis, the
ability to build new neurons.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And your diet is one thing
that determines neurogenesis.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
recommendations

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.913 align:middle line:84%
in the nutrition
and food episode,

00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get a lot of this.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But I want to make sure you
understand these points that

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:90%
are specific to your brain.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.408 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is made out of
healthy fats and cholesterol.

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
cholesterol in your brain.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Cholesterol is not bad for
you, but oxidized cholesterol

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
is bad for you.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So burned cholesterol, deep
fried foods, not good for you.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:10%
Butter, eggs with runny yolks,
grass-fed beef these actually

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:10%
help your brain make neurons
because the lining of neurons

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:10%
is made out of these things.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And deep fried omega 6 fats
and omega 6 fats in general

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.580 align:middle line:90%
are not good for neurogenesis.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Eating a high sugar
diet in studies

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
slows your brain's ability
to build new neurons.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that is like Miracle-Gro

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
for your neurons is
called bioflavonoids.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:10%
Bioflavonoids are colored
compounds in foods and spices.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Now that may make you
say, oh, I clearly

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:10%
should go out and eat
the rainbow of foods.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:10%
But in the nutrition module,
you learn that a lot of foods

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:10%
have things in them that
aren't good for you.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So the magical source
of these bioflavonoids

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is the number one
source is coffee,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
which is very rich in them,
tea, dark chocolate, and herbs

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:90%
and spices.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
If you eat lots of those, you
will get hundreds of times

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
more bioflavonoids
than you would

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
get from eating a salad with
lots of bright colors in it.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So just be aware, that
herb crust on the steak

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is far more important
than having some bell

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:90%
peppers in your salad.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can just prove
that with science.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:10%
Now there are also
supplements that

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.135 align:middle line:10%
contain bioflavonoids
that guarantee

00:13:49.135 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
get what you need

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:10%
to turn on both mitochondria
energy and neuroplasticity.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
There are also studies that
show a fasting mimicking

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
diet or intermittent
fasting will

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:90%
promote myelin regeneration.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:10%
Myelin is the insulation
around your nerves

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:10%
that allows them to carry
electricity with less energy.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat enough
of the right fats

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about, do some
intermittent fasting but not

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
too much, and do
things like sleep,

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
magically your brain will
become more neuroplastic.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you should
do some deep breaths

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
or some meditation.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.465 align:middle line:84%
And you'll learn more
about that as you

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
go through the biohacking
program with me.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Because studies show that
chronic stress inhibits

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
neurogenesis in the
hippocampus, which

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the brain
that's most neuroplastic.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you experience continued
stress and depression,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you can actually get
neural atrophy, which means

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:90%
your neurons start to shrink.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
really, really helps

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
is movement or exercise,
because that increases

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%
blood flow in your brain.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
More blood flow equals
more neurogenesis.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
On the flip side, we are
dealing with a higher neurotoxin

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
load than ever before
because of heavy metals that

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
are present in our soils, in
our kale, in our water supply,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
in our oceans.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We have more man-made chemicals
than ever before, lots

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
of solvents in new cars,
in household products,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
lots of additives and these
actually lower neurogenesis.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:90%
They can kill brain cells.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That new car smell,
that new mattress

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
you bought that smells bad is
actually bad for your brain.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So since we all live in a
world full of those things,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.520 align:middle line:84%
it's up to us to
upregulate our neurogenesis

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
so that we can stay
at least normal

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
or you could go
way beyond normal.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.558 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
biohacking is all about.

00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Some things are a
lot of fun, though.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Scientists found that an
enriched or a fun environment

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
enhances neuron production
in animals and in kids.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And another fun thing
is in studies of animals

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and almost certainly humans,
regular sexual activity

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
increases new neurons
in the hippocampus,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
conscious sex.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So having a loving
relationship where

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
you feel safe and
connected is going

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:90%
to be good for your brain.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
literally, Dave Asprey

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
told me to have more sex.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Just try that line.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:90%
It might work for you.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Now most of these pathways
work by increasing BDNF,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
which is brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is a magical way
to just tell your body,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to make
new nerves, but you

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:90%
can stack things on top of it.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:90%
One of them is ketosis.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:10%
We talked about this a little
bit in the nutrition episode,

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:10%
but ketosis is interesting
because your mitochondria

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:10%
create ATP more efficiently
from ketones than from glucose.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:10%
When you have ketones
present in your body,

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:10%
your heart gets 28%
more energy from ketones

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:10%
than it does from blood sugar.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And your brain does
the same thing.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:84%
This means you don't always
want to be in ketosis.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
intermittent fast, maybe

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
use some of that C8 MCT oil
in the morning with coffee

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
full of minerals,
you can actually

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
turn up your mitochondrial
energy and your neurogenesis

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
just because you
had enough energy.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So cyclical ketosis is
good for your brain.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that your neurons
prefer energy from ketones

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
because it's higher
octane energy.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:10%
And other cells, the
cells inside your brain

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:10%
called glial cells that
repair and maintain myelin,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:10%
they like glucose.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:10%
This is why you don't want to
be in ketosis all the time.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You want to sometimes
have some ketones present

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes have
some carbs present

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:84%
so you get the power
system in the neurons

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and the regeneration
system in the glial cells.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.472 align:middle line:84%
Your body evolved to have
carbs when you get to eat,

00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and then usually there
wasn't food for a while.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would always cycle between
ketones, carbs, ketones, carbs.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Since we now have the power
of biohacking technology,

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:90%
on any day you have carbs.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:10%
You can also have
some C8 MCT oil,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:10%
and magically that adds
enough ketones into your diet

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:10%
that your neurons are happy
and your glial cells are

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:10%
happy at the same time.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And if you do this
for a while, you

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:10%
will see profound changes
in your food cravings

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:10%
and in your ability to think.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I truly know that when
your brain is running

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
the way it's supposed to run,
we are wired inside our cells

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to be kind to each other and
to take care of the world

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.295 align:middle line:84%
But if we're running on half
the energy in our brain,

00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
we just don't have the
energy to choose to do

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.378 align:middle line:90%
the right thing all the time.

00:18:30.378 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we're like,
why did I do that?

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.243 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you did it because
you didn't have enough energy

00:18:35.243 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to do the right thing.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't your fault, but
you are responsible for it

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:90%
because now you know what to do.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And while we're at it,
let's talk a little bit

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:90%
about light and your brain.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.285 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:48.285 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
In the sleep episode,
we talked about light

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and how it signals your
brain for sleep, but let's

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
talk about light
and mitochondria.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:10%
We evolved to absorb sunlight
into every cell in our body,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:10%
including mitochondria.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They actually have
photoreceptors in them.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Your body just doesn't recognize
a blend of light frequencies

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:90%
from junk light.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It feels like static.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like sunlight,
so the body doesn't quite

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:90%
know what to do with it.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Light is a nutrient, but
certain types of light

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:90%
we know what they do.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:10%
Red and infrared light stimulate
certain parts of the brain

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:10%
if you aim them at the
right parts of the brain.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
stimulate, the red light

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
adds electrons which
your body can use.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And infrared light
changes water biochemistry

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
so that you make ATP more
efficiently, more effectively.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
These are clinically studied.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
There are dozens and
dozens of studies that

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:90%
support what I'm talking about.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started one of the
first red-light therapy

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
companies out there
based on the early data.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:10%
In addition, a
neuroscientist from MIT

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:10%
found that lights that
blink 40 times per second

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:10%
can break up amyloid
tangles in the brain.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
do is I take red lights

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
from my light therapy company,
and I'll put them over my head.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel a
difference in your cognition.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
There are a variety
of devices you

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:84%
can get that do light therapy
that way and even clinics

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
like Upgrade Labs where you
can go in and get this done.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
So, what does this mean?

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It means you can
go out and order

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:84%
a low-cost, red-light
therapy device

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and put it over your brain
and see changes in it.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go to a very
high-end neuroscience clinic

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and they'll use a laser over
a certain part of the brain

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate that
region of the brain

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
scientifically validated.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Direct control over your
brain with lasers and lights

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
is now possible.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We are living in the future,
and it's actually pretty cool.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.996 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Inside your brain is
the glymphatic system.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:10%
This is how your brain
washes itself at night.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's active during sleep.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
If you can have increased growth
hormone during deep sleep,

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
it stimulates neurogenesis and
growth of new mitochondria.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So control your sleep quality by
listening to the sleep episode.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect
of that is that you

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
can have more growth
hormone, which

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
means you can have more
neuroplasticity and more

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
mitochondria.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a really good return
on investment for sleep.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And sleep strengthens
connections between your brain

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's a network
where certain brain

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.807 align:middle line:84%
cells like to talk to
each other more or less.

00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is tunable, but it
also improves your memory.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And one good night of sleep
will improve your ability

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to gain new insight into
complex problems by about 50%.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:90%
There's also fitness.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole episode
on fitness for you.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
your brain and fitness

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.035 align:middle line:90%
and how those fit together.

00:21:50.035 --> 00:21:52.166 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Exercise activates
something called PGC-1 alpha

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
which directly increases
levels of BDNF,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that brain-derived
nootropic factor that

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:90%
makes your brain more plastic.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So pick up some heavy
things for five minutes,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and then magically your brain
will be able to learn better.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And researchers at
Northwestern found

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that exercise lowers activity of
bone morphogenic protein, which

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
is a protein that reduces
the rate of neurogenesis.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It also raises
levels of, get this,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:84%
a transmitter
called noggin, which

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is a protein that counteracts
BMP and increases neurogenesis.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's a complex
reaction taking place there.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is doing
some exercise increases

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:90%
neurogenesis.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And now we even know which
steps are affected by that.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Some simple things you can
do that will really help

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
is you can take a movement
break throughout the day.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
If you want to really
make a difference,

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
after lunch, do 5
or 10 Air Squats.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
That alone can
increase neurogenesis,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and it also controls
blood sugar better.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:10%
But one of the
biggest exercises that

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:10%
can make a difference for you
is cross lateral movement.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:10%
That improves brain power.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you force your
left and right hemispheres

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:10%
to work together,
that's a stimulus.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So my right hand goes over
here, and my left hand

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
goes over here, like you
would in table tennis,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
like you would in
pickleball, like you would in

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:90%
yoga where you cross over.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That makes the brain have
to communicate better

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:90%
between the spheres.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:10%
In another study of 15
men, 14 weeks of resistance

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:10%
training without even
knowing about biohacking,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:10%
they had stronger and
faster neural drive,

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:10%
and that's the ability to
send electrical signals

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:10%
from the brain to the muscles.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.625 align:middle line:84%
This is really
important for you.

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
want some fitness,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.875 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't take a
lot of time to do that.

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into the
real biohacking levels

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:90%
around neurofeedback.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Running a biofeedback company
or a neurofeedback company

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
for almost 10 years
now, I've had a chance

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to look at more than 1,500
entrepreneurs and actors

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and pro athletes' brainwaves and
my brainwaves and compare them.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know now
with 100% certainty

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is that meditation changes
the structure of your brain.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Gaia
Network is so important

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
because you learn so
many different styles

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and techniques of
meditation, all of them

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
can improve your
brain structure.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So if a better
brain is your goal,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
pick a Gaia course on
meditation and learn what you're

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%
going to learn in this one.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Do what works best for you
because your brain will

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:90%
evolve and change.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:10%
And what it does is it develops
more folds in the brain's

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:10%
outer layer.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's a trait
correlated with intelligence.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
When you have more
folds in your brain,

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
it makes it easier for
you to process information

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
because you have more surface
area for neurons to work with.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Studies also show that
meditation thickens areas

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:10%
of your cortex and insula.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:10%
And this is where you
get complex thoughts,

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:10%
bodily awareness, concentration,
and problem solving.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So, what's the best
way to meditate?

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, whatever
way works for you.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But the best way of all
is with EEG neurofeedback

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:84%
because when you do this,
you come into a clinic that

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
does that, and you
glue electrodes

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:90%
to various parts of your brain.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And those electrodes are
measuring electrical output

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:90%
from the brain.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
that electrode output,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:90%
it goes into a computer.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the computer shows
you how your meditation looks.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're coming to My
Neurofeedback Center what we do

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
is we look at what very
advanced meditation

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
looks like in a
brain of someone who

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
really has mastered forgiveness,
has mastered gratitude.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And we say, all right,
when you meditate,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
we're going to teach you
what visualizations do.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you
meditate, the sounds

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
are going to get louder when
you're doing a better job,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get quieter
when you do a worse job.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So with regular
meditation, you sit there

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.333 align:middle line:84%
and you take the deep breaths
and you visualize the Buddha

00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your teacher
has taught you to do.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have practiced with
gurus around the world

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to do this.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting there, and
maybe you're doing it right,

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.797 align:middle line:90%
maybe you're not.

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
really good teacher,

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going to pick
up what you're doing.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.407 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
tell you to do something,

00:26:10.407 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:90%
but it takes a long time.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And right now the
world needs people

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
who are conscious and
aware really quickly.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing
is I'm sitting there

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and if I meditate the wrong
way, I don't hear anything.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
If I meditate the right way,
I hear it really, really well.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So this can take years off
of your meditation practice.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this idea that
you could do 40 years of Zen

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
meditation in five days,
well, that's what I do.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.658 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.658 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So now let's assume that you
have a meditation practice

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
already or maybe you're using
one of these upgraded ones.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.057 align:middle line:84%
But what are the
brain supplements

00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
make your brain work

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:84%
better because this was a major
part of me improving my brain

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:90%
function?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:84%
By the way, in order for
brain supplements to work,

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
the basics done.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:10%
One of them is
called vitamin DAKE.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:10%
That's vitamin D-A-K-E. And
the other one is called a Broad

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Spectrum Mineral Supplement.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:10%
These are baseline for
every biological system,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:10%
including your brain.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the most tried
and true of all the brain

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
supplements with
dozens of studies that

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
show it makes you live
longer and improves cognition

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:90%
is called caffeine.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's mother nature's
original smart drug.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It also blocks
inflammation in the brain.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:90%
It enhances cognition.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Another one that
people miss a lot

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:10%
is coenzyme Q10, which
is a common supplement,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:10%
but it protects against
oxidative stress

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:10%
and makes mitochondria stronger.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Other common things
that improve your brain

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:10%
are vitamin B12 and
folinic acid or folate.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You need these for
mental function.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
deficient in one, you

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:90%
become deficient in the other.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:10%
And you want to use the
methylated form called

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:10%
methylcobalamin not folic acid.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Then there's magnesium.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's used in more than 300
enzymatic processes, including

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
making ATP, which your
brain needs to make energy.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It reverses effects of stress
in your brain, increases memory,

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and cognitive function.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Then there's something
called creatine, which

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:90%
bodybuilders used to take.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Creatine increases working
memory and intelligence.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's exceptionally safe, and
everyone should be on it.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
If you are on a plant-based
diet exclusively,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you
should do is add some ghee

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.383 align:middle line:84%
from grass-fed cows in so you
can absorb your bioflavonoids.

00:28:28.383 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing you should do

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is you should take
creatine because creatine

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is lacking if you're
on a plant-based diet.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:40.540 align:middle line:10%
After that massive brain changes
from Krill Oil and astaxanthin,

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:10%
which is a colored compound
a bioflavonoid that

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:10%
comes from eating krill
or it can come from algae

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:10%
in the ocean when
it's concentrated,

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:10%
it helps to fight inflammation.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It maintains brain structure.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It keeps neurons in the
brain communicating freely.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I take five times the normal
dose of astaxanthin every day,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and I have for years.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You can also get
blends of polyphenols

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that protect your mitochondria
and directly increase BDNF.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:90%
So look for a polyphenol blend.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:10%
There's something
called oxaloacetic acid,

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:10%
which is part of making energy.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
powerful cognitive booster

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I've used for more
than 10 years.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:90%
There's also PQQ.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a very potent
thing that increases

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:90%
mitochondrial biogenesis.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And it protects
against inflammation.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It stimulates nerve
growth factor.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it causes you to
regenerate peripheral nerves.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you have stomach acid
present, it doesn't work.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So take it with a little
bit of baking soda.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And finally, to directly
stimulate nerve growth factor,

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:90%
there's two things you could do.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:10%
One of them is a
lion's mane extract

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:10%
that includes heat and
alcohol extractives

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:10%
or you could do a green
coffee fruit extract.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Both of those have studies
that show that they

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:90%
increase neuroplasticity.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you're into
meditation, you're

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
into improving your
brain, you might consider.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Those are some of the big guns.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But there are so
many more supplements

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that can change your
mental function.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to take them all.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a race to
see who takes the most.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a race to
see how quickly

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and how far you can
transform yourself.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why biohacking
is so important.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
this without taking

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:90%
any of those supplements.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.435 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is that you know

00:30:25.435 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:90%
you have the power to do this.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
very, very affordable,

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
like vitamin DAKE
and minerals are

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
low cost things that transform
every system in the body.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And others like
lion's mane mushroom

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:90%
are very micro-focused.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know there's
a big world of nootropics

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I share a lot of information
about this online for you

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is Biohacking.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:90%
