By tuning our spiritual antenna to gratitude, activating states of bliss and joy becomes a potential holistic healing strategy with possible reinforcement by biofeedback and meditation. Other techniques to access somatic states for spiritual reset include EMDR, holotropic breathing, and tantric sex.
