00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Biohacking, it's not
just about being well,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
it's about being more than well.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is Biohacking.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Dave Asprey, the
Father of Biohacking.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
I created the biohacking
movement more than 10 years ago

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
so that we could all have
control over our own biology

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:10%
because my body wasn't doing
what I wanted it to do.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'll
teach you about hacks

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to improve the
quality of your sleep.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.506 align:middle line:90%

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
My sleep was terrible.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I would go to bed.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I started sleeping with a
monitor about 15 years ago,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I would get 5 minutes
of deep sleep per night.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:90%
You want at least 90 minutes.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would just always
wake up feeling almost

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:90%
like I hadn't slept.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out I had
terrible sleep hygiene,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
but no one talked about
hacking your sleep.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't such a thing.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And as I started
getting data, I looked

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
at what I could do to
change my sleep quality.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed all the
experts in the field,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and here's what's going on.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Your lack of quality sleep
accelerates your aging.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Just one good night of sleep
can improve your ability

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to learn new motor
skills by about 20%.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're
learning basketball or ping

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
pong or whatever it
is, 20% improvement,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that goes for your
teenagers too.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And getting regular
quality sleep

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
increases your ability
to gain new insight

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:90%
into complex problems by 50%.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I can do what I do as the leader
of the biohacking movement

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
because I learned
how to sleep better,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:84%
so I can get all this
information, I can crunch it.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you take away my good
quality sleep for a week,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of useless.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that sleep also
improves your skin health.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:90%
It makes you look younger.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And one night of bad sleep
impairs glucose control.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Even if you slept 8 hours,
if it was poor quality sleep,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
the next day you could
look like a prediabetic.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And that same meal that was
fine the day before, now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:90%
puts you in a blood sugar spike.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you get less
than six hours of sleep,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:90%
your hunger hormones change.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Your ghrelin, which
is the hunger hormone,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
increases, and leptin, which
is the fullness hormone,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
goes down.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Scientists also recently
discovered a new organ system

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:10%
in the body called
the glymphatic system,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:10%
and this is the way your brain
gets rid of waste products.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:10%
So every night while
you're sleeping your body

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:10%
uses mitochondrial energy
to pump cerebrospinal fluid

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:10%
into your brain, and then it
washes all the brain toxins

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:10%
out, and then it
flushes them out.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
have enough sleep,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the neurotoxins that
build up during the day

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
stay in your brain.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that gets cleared

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
by your glymphatic system
is amyloid proteins

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that are the hallmark of
Alzheimer's when they build up

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you get good quality
sleep with 90 minutes of deep

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.425 align:middle line:84%
sleep and 90 minutes
of REM sleep--

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'll define those for you so
you know what they are and how

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to get them--

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
magically you don't need 8
hours of sleep per night.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you might
not like this,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but studies show, three
studies of millions

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
of people over
multiple years, show

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that the people who
live the longest

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.877 align:middle line:90%
sleep 6.5 hours per night.

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's not because
you should sleep less

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to live longer, it's because
healthy people need less sleep.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you need 9 hours a
night, it means it's time

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to become better at
sleeping and maybe

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
listen to all of the
different episodes,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
so you can figure out how to
make your health more vibrant.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Every night when you're asleep
you cycle through REM and nREM

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%
sleep.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.333 align:middle line:90%
And nREM is nonREM sleep.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
types of that.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
There's stage 1 is light sleep.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Stage 2 is middle sleep.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:10%
And stage 3 is deep delta sleep.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
The most important
things to know

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
are if you get REM, the
dreaming state, and deep sleep,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
if you get those two
things, you've pretty much

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
had a good night's sleep.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
That stage 3 deep sleep is
when your breathing and heart

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
rate dropped to
the lowest level,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
your brainwaves slow
down and get wider.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
It's called delta brain waves.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's during that
delta brain wave time

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that your glymphatic
system kicks in,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and it cleans your brain out.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I say it cleans
it out, your cells

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:90%
in the brain literally shrink.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
They excrete water
full of toxins,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and then they suck in new water.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like changing
the tank in your aquarium

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:84%
except inside your brain
every single night.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing we
didn't know about this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
until about a decade ago.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
That slow wave sleep, it
reduces stress hormones,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
it triggers the release of
immune system supporting

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
hormones.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And unless you do something
about it, as you age,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
the amount of time you spend
in deep sleep goes down.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And that goal, again, is an
hour and a half of REM sleep

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and an hour and a
half of deep sleep.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about circadian
rhythm and what that is

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and how it's signaled
because biohacking

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is the art of changing
the environment around you

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and inside of you so
you have full control

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:90%
over your own biology.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.838 align:middle line:84%
Well, what in the environment
around you is controlling you?

00:05:27.838 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you change
that so then your body

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:90%
will do what you want it to do.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes have something called
melanopsin receptors in them.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Light goes into your eyes, and
you think you see all the light

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
because you're watching
this right now,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
but 5% of the light
that went into your eyes

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
went around your visual
cortex into the timing system

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of your brain, which is called
the super charismatic nucleus

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:90%
or the SCN.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
This is your body's
central controller

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that tells every part
of your body, hey,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
this is what time
it is right now.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
sleep issues, it's

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
very likely that you have a
problem with circadian timing.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, what sets your
circadian timing?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that light is
a major and most important

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:84%
contributor to
circadian dysfunction.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more important
than many other things

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that people might think
matter that do matter.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.333 align:middle line:84%
But if you, say,
control when you

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
have dinner because
you think it's

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
going to make you sleep
better, but then you

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.965 align:middle line:84%
get the wrong light
exposure, the light

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:26.085 align:middle line:90%
trumps the food timing.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
For light, it's the
intensity, it's the color,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's the angle of the
light coming into your eyes.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Those little cells in here
are looking at those things

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
because 2 billion
years ago when we

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
were mitochondria
floating in the ocean

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and another kind of cell,
well, in the morning,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
the sun came up at a certain
color and you had sunrise.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
middle of the day,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
we had bright sunlight
right overhead

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:90%
with full spectrum colors.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
there was the most

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
food available
because we were eating

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:90%
algae and things like that.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then at night, we
had more red color.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so our bodies are still
acting like we're that,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.862 align:middle line:90%
and that's annoying.

00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So what are we're
going to do about that?

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
change the lighting.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
What that means
is that blue light

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
during the day from the sun
can help wake you up, keep

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
you alert, and improve
mood because there

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is no blue light in the
morning or at night.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
What that also means, though, is
that if you overexpose yourself

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to blue light, you can
get brain stress from that

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:84%
because those little
cells are trying

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what time it is.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't like it when there's
a bright LED right overhead,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but it's 6:00 AM or 6:00
PM because that's not

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
where the sun should be, and
it creates a timing mismatch.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things you can
do that is really powerful

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:90%
is you can get morning sunlight.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
What that means is as
soon as you wake up,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
you have your cup of
coffee with minerals in it,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and go outside, Take
off your glasses,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
take off your contact lenses
and get some morning sunlight.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
20 minutes is all it takes.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
That morning light will
tell your mitochondria,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
tell your brain, tell your
SCN, hey, it's morning time.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And at night you will get
better sleep in less time

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
because of what you
did in the morning.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It actually helps you
to make serotonin,

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
which is known as the
happiness chemical,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and that helps you make
more melatonin at night

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
because melatonin is
made out of serotonin.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The newer artificial
lights like LEDs

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and compact
fluorescent bulbs, they

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:90%
don't have any infrared light.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
They have very little
violet and red light that's

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
found in the sun, so they are
the equivalent of junk light.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Big food companies
tried to tell you

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.282 align:middle line:84%
that high fructose corn syrup
was the same thing as sugar.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But sugar does something
different to your body

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
even though they
both taste sweet.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
You look at light
from an LED bulb,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.202 align:middle line:84%
and magically, you're not seeing
the same thing as sunlight.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And your body knows
the difference,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and it does create a
stress, and it does mess

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:90%
with your circadian rhythm.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why at night
it's particularly important

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that you turn down or turn
off that kind of lighting.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.918 align:middle line:84%
We're getting a huge
amount of that light

00:08:57.918 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
during the day from screens,
and normally, your pineal gland

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:84%
starts releasing melatonin
a few hours before bed.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you get even 5 seconds
of blue light from, say,

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
bright LED lights in your
kitchen or your bathroom,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
it messes with that system
because it stimulates

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cells called

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
ipRGCs in your retina.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Those light sensors send light
info to the circadian clock,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and then your body says,
well, in 2 billion years

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, there's never
been a source of light

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
like this except for
sunlight, therefore, it

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
can't be nighttime, therefore
the clock is scrambled.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Blue light before bed
suppresses melatonin the most,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
but there are four other
colors of light that affect it.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is why blue
blockers before bed

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
don't work very
well, and that's also

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
why blue blockers during the
day are too much because you

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
need some blue light to wake
up and be happy during the day.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The glasses I'm wearing
now are not blue blockers,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
they're partial blue
blockers because they

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
allow my brain to relax but
still get enough blue light.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
If you work indoors all the
time or you have headaches,

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
you might consider partial
blue blockers like.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That you can get a 75% boost
in your melatonin levels

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
just by removing bright
lights especially

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
LED lights and blue
lights at night.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Blue light at night from
normal white LED bulbs

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is linked to rapid aging,
it stresses mitochondria

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
in your eyes, and it leads to
widespread metabolic problems

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and inflammation.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.392 align:middle line:84%
So when your timing
system is off the,

00:10:32.392 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
timing system tells
your cells when

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.725 align:middle line:84%
they should be making
energy versus when they

00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
should be repairing things.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you scramble it by
brushing your teeth before bed

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
under bright lights,
is it any wonder

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that you have metabolic
dysregulation that's

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:90%
even correlated with diabetes?

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
One study found that adults
who were exposed to blue light

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:84%
while eating in the evening had
higher glucose levels, slower

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
metabolisms even than
those who ate in dim light.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Get a dimmer switch
or get some candles,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:90%
that's what I do when I eat.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
People exposed to lots
of blue light at night

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
have higher risk of cancer.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Blue light exposure
is linked to obesity

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:90%
and other metabolic disorders.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We also have this
problem that blue light

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:90%
leads to macular degeneration.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
More than 11 million
people over age 60

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
have some form of
this visual problem.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So I keep saying blue light,
but what am I talking about?

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about LED lights
because all of the lights that

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:10%
have white spectrum in them
are actually blue LEDs modified

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:10%
with coatings to have
less blue, but they still

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:10%
have way more blue
than sunshine.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at a light
and it's an LED light,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
there is no guarantee
that your body

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to respond the same
way as it would from sunlight.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we know that it won't.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The colors that affect your
circadian rhythm are blue light

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
obviously, yellow light, green
light, and violet light all

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
will stop you from
getting quality sleep.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:84%
This is why my house
has dimmer switches,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and we have red
nightlights at night

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
because with those you
can still go to sleep.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note, though,
that bright lights, even

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
if they're red will affect
your circadian rhythm,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
but the color of the
light is very important.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Once this biohacking
knowledge becomes commonplace,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
we are going to change the
way we do lighting in cities.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
With the exterior
lighting like streetlights

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
you can make them
a warmer frequency,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and then birds
don't die as much,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
insects don't die
as much, and people

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.005 align:middle line:84%
who are outdoors at
night can go to bed.

00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to change the
lighting inside our homes

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, it's up to
you to get dimmer switches

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
in your bathroom or just have
a little plug-in red LED bulb.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Red LEDs are just fine as long
as they're not super bright.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.615 align:middle line:84%
You have billions of
ancient bacteria embedded

00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
in your body trying
to figure out

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around you
before you can even think.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
They know that if there's a
little white or a little green

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.413 align:middle line:84%
LED or a little blue LED, that
it must be daytime because

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
in all of our evolution there
never has been such a thing.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're exquisitely
light sensitive.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Even though you might not see
them, they're still doing that.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take a little
bit of black electrical tape

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and you were to cover all
the LEDs in your bedroom

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
or better yet unplug them so
that it's completely blacked

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
out, you will sleep better
because your body will

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
relax more, you'll get
more sleep in less time.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And get some blackout
curtains that actually work.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.523 align:middle line:84%
They need to be
blacking out the room.

00:13:26.523 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
They should have
Velcro around the edges

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
so that truly no
light gets through.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
in Japan of 800 men

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and showed a 75%
increase in depression

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
from the amount of light that
comes around the curtains

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
at the edges in an
average city at night.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:10%
Let me say that again,
75% increase in depression

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:10%
from normal city lighting
levels coming around curtains.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
That means you have control
over your environment.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
You can make a one-time
change in the window coverings

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:84%
in your bedroom and tape
over the little lights,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.207 align:middle line:84%
and you will get better
sleep every night as long

00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:90%
as you sleep in that room.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.248 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the simplest
things you could ever

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
do to improve your
metabolic quality of life.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.185 align:middle line:84%
This is why biohacking
is so powerful.

00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You change your
environment around you,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and you get better sleep
without any effort.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
you might want to do

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
is roll up a towel or
a blanket and put it

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
underneath your bedroom
door, especially in hotels.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I've stayed in lots
of hotels where

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
it's like a spotlight
coming under the door.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You want to sleep in
a cave because that's

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:84%
where your body feels
safest, in a dark cave.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:10%
And you could use candles,
or even the little warm

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:10%
led candles can be just
fine but you want dim

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:10%
and you want warm frequencies.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
You also can consider glasses
like the ones I'm wearing.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can just google
Dave Asprey glasses.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%
All the details are out there.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And these are controlling
the color, the angle

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and the brightness.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've managed to completely
eliminate jet lag by using

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:90%
the right color of glasses.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes
to sleep temperature,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:90%
this is another big signal.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to this story
about mitochondria floating

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean 2
billion years ago,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
well, they knew that when the
sun first came up, it was cool.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it got
warmer and warmer

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and brighter and brighter, and
there was more and more food.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And then as the sun started to
set, it got cooler and cooler,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and there was less and less
food until it got to be dark.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you change the
temperature at which you sleep,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:84%
you can get up to
40% more deep sleep,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and you can fall
asleep 20% faster.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are huge
numbers because you

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
go to sleep for a third of your
life, unless you're like me

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and you only get
6.5 hours a night

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:90%
because that's all you need.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Still, that's a large
percentage of your life

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
so let's do it
40% better, right?

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
In order to improve
your deep sleep,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
you want to make it
colder and cooler

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of the night,
the first half of the night.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:10%
And then for the second
half of the night,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:10%
you want it to be at exactly
comfortable temperature, not

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:10%
warm, not cold.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can get special mattress
pads or bedding equipment that

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.867 align:middle line:84%
controls the
temperature, and you

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
can get things that
turn the thermostat down

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:90%
before you go to bed.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Studies show between
60 and 67 degrees

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:10%
Fahrenheit is the ideal
temperature at least

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:10%
for the first half of the night.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You might turn it up a
couple of degrees after that.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, you don't want
to wake up to do that.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So you get a system
that will automatically

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
change the temperature as you
go through your sleep cycles.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You will find profound changes
in how you feel in the morning.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're worried
about being cold,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
you won't be cold after
the first night or two.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a cool
pillow under your head.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.565 align:middle line:84%
You know it always feels
nice and refreshing,

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
your whole mattress
feels that way.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And that incredible
sensation when you wake up

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
after getting 40% more
deep sleep the night

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
before so your brain
could flush out toxins

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:84%
because your
mattress was cooler,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.548 align:middle line:90%
yes, you can actually do that.

00:16:52.548 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you just turn your
thermostat down, either one

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happens
at night when melatonin gets

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
released is that the
insulin-producing cells

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
in your pancreas shut down.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that as
soon as melatonin turns on,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
which happens as
the sun goes down,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
is that your body's insulin
response doesn't work

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
very well so you
get a blood glucose

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
spike which can cause
an adrenaline rush

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:90%
and it keeps you awake.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.055 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up at
3:00 to 5:00 AM,

00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and you have racing
thoughts, you

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
can't go back to
sleep, that's probably

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.832 align:middle line:84%
what's happening because your
body ran out of blood sugar

00:17:27.832 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
because you had a blood
sugar spike because you

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:90%
ate too late, then a crash.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
During the crash, you got
cortisol and adrenaline

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and that got your
blood sugar back up,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately, it also kept
you from going back to sleep.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So addressing your blood sugar
issues could change everything.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Another common
problem is caffeine.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I am the world's
biggest fan of coffee.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I've started two major
coffee companies.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I stopped drinking
caffeine at 2:00 PM,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and I switched to decaf then.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Because for most people,
you'll have cleared out

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
enough caffeine before
bedtime, and that's just fine.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 10% of people are
very sensitive to caffeine,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and you either need
to stop earlier or not

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
even drink caffeine.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:90%
But for most of us that works.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Espresso at dinner
even if you can still

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
go to sleep the sleep,
won't be very good.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Most fitness trackers
today will track sleep

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:90%
so you can get the data.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.728 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'm
saying here has been

00:18:19.728 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
validated on hundreds
of thousands of people.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It gets a bit
confusing because you

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:84%
know you want to stay away
from large meals near bedtime.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I've asked you to stop eating
when the sun goes down ideally,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
but you do need energy
to sleep because remember

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that glymphatic system
we talked about?

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, that needs energy to
pump clean fluids in and out

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So that cortisol boost between
3:00 to 5:00 AM is hackable,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to
understand this.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Here are some things you can
try if this happens to you.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
One of them is you could
try 1 teaspoon of C8 MCT oil

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in warm tea.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You blend it in there,
and you drink it.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:10%
The reason for this is that MCT
oil is a backup energy source

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:10%
specifically for the brain.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:10%
You also could try adding
some grass fed collagen

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:10%
or some glycine amino acid.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And those things
about a tablespoon

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
can have a profound effect
on your energy levels

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're asleep because
you need energy to sleep well.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
If those don't work, try adding
1 to 2 teaspoons of raw honey.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
It has to be raw, and you
can't put it in hot tea

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
because that cooks the honey.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Raw honey will build something
called glycogen in your liver.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how your liver
stores carbohydrates.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And when your brain
asks for more sugar,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
it asks the liver first.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So liver glycogen fuels the
brain before muscle glycogen

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that will
really harm your sleep

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:90%
is if you exercise before bed.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You go to the gym, you got
bright lights in the gym,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of music,
and you're exercising.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:84%
When you exercise, it
increases your cortisol levels.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
High cortisol at bedtime
equals poor quality sleep.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
So don't exercise before bed.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But you could go for
a walk before bed.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember, walking isn't
exercise, it's movement.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Movement before bed, good.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Intense exercise
before bed, bad.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is anyone
with a sleep tracker

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
has already figured this
out, alcohol in any amount

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:90%
is bad for sleep.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
That one glass of wine
that you just have to have,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
it might help you go to
sleep, but your sleep quality

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.343 align:middle line:84%
will always be
trashed by alcohol.

00:20:30.343 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are some things you
can do to help with alcohol.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I've written a lot about
that, but alcohol is just not

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:90%
good for sleep.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So if your goal is
improving sleep, replace

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the alcohol with something
else you like to drink.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Replace it even with
dessert if you have to.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Just don't drink if
sleep is the goal.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Also, turning off electronics
2 hours before bed

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
is a great goal.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't do that most of
the time because well, I

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
have stuff to do because
I'm watching a show.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:10%
But what I do is I use night
shift mode on my phone.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:10%
I change other
settings to increase

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:10%
the amount of red light
that comes out of my phone.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:10%
And if I'm watching
on a bigger screen,

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:10%
I will use the specific glasses
that are designed for sleep.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Changing the color of light
is really, really important.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that changes
your sleep that you probably

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't think about is
the presence of Wi-Fi

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
especially if your Wi-Fi
router is in the same room

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
or near your bed.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Your body is sensitive to
electromagnetic frequencies,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and Wi-Fi does create a
stress response in your body.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You want your body to feel
like it's totally safe

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and protected in a dark
cave and nothing on Earth

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:90%
could touch it.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So have a little
remote control switch

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can buy for $20
online that allows you to press

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
a button to turn off power,
and it turns off power

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:90%
to my Wi-Fi system.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So at night, I have
a more relaxing

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic environment.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
If you have your phone
in the room with you,

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the screen needs to be turned
all the way down on brightness,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be in airplane
mode at the very least.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this is that
if it's not an airplane mode,

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.760 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to be pumping
out EMFs all night long

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%
that affect your sleep.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to sleep,
there's something else

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that makes a big
difference, it's

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
how you breathe
when you're asleep.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Sleep apnea is a major
problem because it puts you

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
at risk of other diseases.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
apnea and you snore a lot,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that puts you at risk
of developing diabetes,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
obesity, and high
blood pressure.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't imagine
this but sometimes

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
mitochondrial dysfunction
is a cause of snoring.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
hack that I really

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
want you to know about because
it can change your life.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you use
sleep tape on your mouth.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So you close your mouth,
you put a little bit of tape

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
right here, just right
under your nose that gently

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
holds your lips together.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.962 align:middle line:84%
So when you're sleeping,
your mouth is closed,

00:22:51.962 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
your body will breathe
through your nose.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You might say, but I can't
breathe through my nose.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.467 align:middle line:84%
Your body has a reflex
to open up your sinuses

00:22:58.467 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:90%
when your mouth is closed.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You get more nitric oxide,
way more oxygen in the brain,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and you feel better
in the morning.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't get cavities.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.028 align:middle line:90%
You don't get morning breath.

00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It is a profound difference.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
You also might consider
using a custom bite guard.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
As you age, you grind
down your rear molars,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and it changes the
angle of your bite.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out having
lower teeth in the back,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
especially if you grind and
clench changes the stress

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
on the trigeminal nerve, which
changes your fight or flight

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:90%
nerve called the vagal nerve.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I do at night,
I put in a bite guard,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I put a piece of tape on the
front, and I sleep way better,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and I don't interfere
with my partner

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84%
because I don't snore because
my mouth is taped shut.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of people
who tape their mouths now,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and it just makes so many
parts of your life better.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It is so simple,
highly recommended.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that works
well for some people

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:90%
is a nasal dilator.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There are things that fit
right inside the entrance

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:90%
to your nose.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
They are silicone rings.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
They last for a long time.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And you put that in before you
go to bed, and you don't snore,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and you breathe better.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your body to get
oxygen when you're asleep

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.062 align:middle line:84%
is a pretty good
investment for biohacking.

00:24:05.062 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:84%
People also ask, hey, what's
the best sleep position?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
Dr. Peter Martone,

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
who I've interviewed
several times on my show,

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
his studies say that back
sleeping closes your airway.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people snore
worse on their back

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
but that the issue
is head support.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:84%
When you support
your head right,

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
you reinforce the wrong
curve in your neck.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
When you put a regular
pillow under your head,

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.875 align:middle line:90%
you're closing your airway.

00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:90%
See how it pushes on my head?

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It goes down.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
When you bring your neck back,
you can open up the airway.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:84%
When Dr. Martone
reviewed X-rays,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
he found 90% of his patients
had a loss of the cervical curve

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:90%
if they were side sleepers.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
When you sleep on your
side, you break down

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
your maxilla which can
cause TMJ dysfunction.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.455 align:middle line:10%
You get the right
pillow and one that

00:24:56.455 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:10%
looks at the distance between
your ear and your shoulder.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:10%
If you sleep on
your side, that's

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:10%
going to be a fat pillow.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And if you sleep on your back,
it's going to be a thin pillow.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you wake up and your
neck is cricked like this,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
it's going to inhibit that
cerebral spinal flow that is

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:90%
part of the glymphatic system.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to just pay a lot
of attention to your pillow.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.537 align:middle line:84%
Enough pillow between your
shoulder and your head

00:25:18.537 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:90%
if you sleep on your side.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If you sleep on your back,
you want a very thin pillow,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and you want it bunched
up under your neck.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Another hack is you can find
some cement blocks or wood

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
blocks and elevate the head
of the bed, just the part

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
where your head is,
by 5 to 7 degrees.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
That's 6 inches
for a normal bed.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So 6 inch blocks under
the head of the bed.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:90%
It improves sleep quality.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It helps your brain dump toxins
with assistance from gravity,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.587 align:middle line:84%
and there are crazy studies out
of Germany showing improvements

00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:90%
even in things like Alzheimer's.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, my bed at home
is at a slight angle

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:90%
and it works just fine.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.736 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:90%
There's also the mattress.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
What kind of mattress
do you want to sleep on?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Cotton or wool would be best,
but synthetics are not ideal,

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
even though there are so many
foam mattresses out there.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.543 align:middle line:84%
You want to get organic
latex unless you're allergic.

00:26:15.543 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
things you could do,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
though, is to put a dust-proof
pillowcase on your pillows

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and on your mattress
itself to seal

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:90%
in whatever's in your mattress.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So many mattresses today,
especially in the US

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
have 6 pounds of flame
retardant chemicals

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:90%
that are harmful for your body.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So you want a low-toxin
mattress or at a minimum wrap

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.588 align:middle line:10%
yours in a impermeable
membrane so

00:26:38.588 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:10%
that you don't have
to deal with that

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:10%
and make your body do
all the extra detoxing.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You might also
consider something

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:90%
called a weighted blanket.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
This is a blanket
that can weigh up

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to 30 pounds ideally full
of glass beads instead

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:90%
of plastic beads.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
this on top of you

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like a
noise-canceling headphones

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:90%
for your whole nervous system.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.525 align:middle line:84%
It reduces the amount of time
it takes you to go to sleep.

00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So you lay down, put on the
weighted blanket, you're out.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It takes your body out
of fight or flight.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.037 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is get
a blanket that's about 10%

00:27:09.037 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:90%
of your body weight.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It works through pressure touch
which stimulates serotonin

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:90%
like getting a hug.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.662 align:middle line:84%
So if you toss and turn
a lot, a weighted blanket

00:27:16.662 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:90%
can just be a godsend.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, a one-time
affordable investment

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that pays dividends every night
for the rest of your life.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:90%
I sleep with a weighted blanket.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:90%
I have for about eight years.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:84%
If you do end up getting
a foam mattress that

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
smells of chemicals, do
not sleep on that mattress.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You want to put it out in the
sun to get as hot as you can.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in a room with a heater
on all the way with a fan on,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and you want to bake the
chemicals out of the mattress.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It can take from two
days up to two weeks,

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:84%
depending on your mattress,
until it doesn't smell anymore.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Sleeping on a mattress
that smells like foam

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to expose you to a
huge number of toxins that can

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:90%
dysregulate your mitochondria.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Should you sleep with a partner?

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
show up to 39% of people

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
wish they could sleep
without their partner,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's because of snoring
and other sleep quality issues.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You have a partner
who tosses and turns.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the hacks you've already
learned will help that.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So partner sleeping
reduces sleep quality,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
but it increases
oxytocin levels.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
If you sleep separately, you
have less oxytocin, less pair

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:90%
bonding.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So you might want to consider
if your household allows

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:90%
for that, have it a share bed.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.585 align:middle line:84%
And nights when you
really need sleep,

00:28:28.585 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe you sleep separately.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to be all
of one or all of the other.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to do
is track your sleep

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and see how to get a great
night's sleep in the same bed

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:90%
as your partner.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:90%
If that doesn't work, alternate.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I've mentioned sleep quality.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I've mentioned REM sleep.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I've mentioned deep sleep,
but how do you know?

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can use an app on your
phone to track your sleep just

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
using the microphone.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not great, but
it's good enough.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you could even
go simpler than that

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and just keep a journal.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
In the morning when you wake up,
how did I feel when I woke up?

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Were my joints sore?

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Was I tired?

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Was I awake?

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And that can make
a big difference.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.800 align:middle line:84%
If you have a smart
watch, it probably

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
has reasonable sleep
tracking on it.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Any fitness monitor
likely does that already.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Your job is just to look
at it in the morning

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.715 align:middle line:90%
and see how you did.

00:29:17.715 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you get more
or less deep sleep?

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Did you get more
or less REM sleep?

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you have a baseline,
do any of the things

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
you've learned in this episode
and see how it improves.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:84%
After 15 years of tracking my
sleep data every single night,

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
these are the things that work.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is Biohacking.
