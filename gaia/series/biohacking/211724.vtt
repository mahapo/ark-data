00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVE ASPREY: Biohacking,
it's not just about being well.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It's about being more than well.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is Biohacking.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Dave Asprey, the
father of biohacking.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:10%
And people call me
that because this

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:10%
is a new movement
in society, and it's

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.437 align:middle line:10%
a new word in the English
language that I created.

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
you're going to learn

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:90%
about fitness and exercise.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But they are not what
you think they are.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about struggle.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not about suffering.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.762 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
forcing yourself to go

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
to the gym with willpower.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that muscle mass
is one of the greatest

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:90%
predictors of longevity.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you have more muscle
up to a certain level anyway,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to live longer
because you can handle whatever

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:90%
life brings your way.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to have that.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So in this episode,
I'm going to teach you

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
how to structure your exercise
routine to put on muscle

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and to lose fat in the least
possible amount of time

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
without over exercising and
overstressing your body.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Today, most people either
don't exercise at all

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
because they figured out
it doesn't work very well,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:90%
or people exercise all the time.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those is
where you want to be.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get great
returns on very small amounts

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:90%
of exercise.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.427 align:middle line:84%
Most of us were just
doing it all wrong.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that's confusing

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
is that exercise is not the
same thing as moving around.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
You can go for a
walk with your kids.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.473 align:middle line:90%
It's just not exercise.

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
You moved, and movement
is good for you.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And usually, more
movement is better.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
In order for something
to be exercise,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
it has to cause the
body to transform.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And that means it must be
brief, it must be intense,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
it must be infrequent, not
every day, it must be safe,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and it must be purposeful.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
you want to do this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:90%
is that exercise increases BDNF.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
That stands for Brain
Derived Neurotrophic Factor.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff in
your brain that gives you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:90%
a young person's brain.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It makes you a neuroplastic
so you can learn.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you exercise the
way I just described,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
infrequently, you'll have a
brain that can adapt better

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:90%
to the world you live in.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to cardio, people

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
think that cardio helps
you lose fat quickly.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
not how it works.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's true that having
better cardio capacity

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
extends your lifespan.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a measure
called VO2 max,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
which is how much oxygen your
body can use at one time.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:90%
That is a measure of longevity.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out more
cardio is not better.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard people saying,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
get your 10,000
steps per day in.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was the
CTO and co-founder

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
of the first fitness tracker
that could get your heart

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
rate from your wrist.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I went, and I
looked deep on the data.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, a Japanese
company, the first company

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to make a pedometer, invented
that 10,000 steps rule

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%
so they could sell their tech.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
There is no scientific evidence
behind 10,000 steps per day.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:90%
That's just marketing.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
When I weighed 300 pounds,
I believe that stuff,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I would push myself.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I made a sacred commitment that
I was going to lose the weight.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the gym six
days a week no matter what,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%
and I went for 90 minutes a day.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes of weights.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes of cardio.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I skipped Sundays.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I also cut my calories.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:90%
I cut my fat.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of 18 months
of this, 702 hours in the gym,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I still had a 46-inch
waist, I was still fat,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and I could max out
most of the machines.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know that steady
state cardio, the treadmills

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I like to do,
equals wear and tear

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:90%
on your joints and ligaments.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at Yale Medicine
found that at least 50%

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of runners are
injured each year,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and they think the number
may be much higher.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Running and chronic
cardio teaches your heart

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to beat faster and to
move less blood per beat.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a powerful,
healthy animal or human,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
the healthiest state
is to be able to move

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot of blood per heartbeat.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So cardio teaches your heart
to go blip, blip, blip.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you do weight training
and appropriate types

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:84%
of cardio, not the long distance
cardio, in a single heartbeat,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
you can transform
your blood flow.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So cardio doesn't
equal strength.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:10%
It also turns out,
we like to believe

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:10%
that doing more of something
gives us better results.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But what the body
really listens to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
is what I call slope
of the curve inputs.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that if
you can turn on a stressor,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
like sprinting, or picking
up something heavy,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
if you can do that very quickly
to the point of exhaustion

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and then recover faster than
mother nature would expect,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
then you're sending
this beautiful signal

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
into the body that says, a tiger
might have eaten you, that's

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
why you did something
hard, but now you're

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
really safe because you
return to baseline quickly.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's a signal to change.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you had
your minerals, as long

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
as you had your protein
and you had your fat,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
your body has what it
takes, and the signal,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
you put those together, you
get rapid transformation.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:10%
As an example, we know that
high intensity interval training

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:10%
works well in less time.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
We used to think just go
for a run for an hour.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But now, we
understand that if you

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
were to do five 1 minute
sprints with a break in between,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you get better
results in less time.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's still miserable.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
While using AI,
you can figure out

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
exactly what curve causes
humans to change the most.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And the results
ought to upset you.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
if you use AI, you

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
come up with something
called REHIT, which

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
is a core technology
behind my fitness franchise

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that's opening
across the country.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
REHIT stands for Reduced
Exertion High Intensity

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Training.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
In this kind of training,
it's two 20-second sprints

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
without sweating over
a five-minute period.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
If you do that
three times a week,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.495 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes per week,
that's as much time

00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
as you spend
brushing your teeth,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
you improve your
cardiac capacity by 12%.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
If you did an hour a day,
you would improve by 5%.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
REHIT improves
insulin sensitivity,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and it increases
your VO2 max, which

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
is the core fitness for
cardiovascular capacity.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:10%
But 15 minutes a week of
that kind of exercise,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:10%
which requires no sweating,
will increase your VO2 max

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:10%
by 12%, which is equal to about
two years of healthy lifespan.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
If you were to do an hour
a day of chronic cardio,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:90%
you would improve by 2%.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Six times more results in
15 minutes versus an hour

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
a day of suffering
on a spin bike.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
That is why this episode
is so important for you.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
go to the gym enough.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you do go to the
gym, you might go too much.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.003 align:middle line:84%
But you just learned a way to
get six times better results

00:07:02.003 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
in the amount of time you
spend brushing your teeth.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
This is what AI
and tech is doing.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
This is why biohacking
is so important.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The technical
details of REHIT is

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're causing very
rapid depletion of something

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
called glycogen in your cells.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the
carbohydrate storage.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And that releases signaling
molecules, including

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
PGC-1 alpha, which is a sign
that your body exercised,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
and something called AMPK.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And this tells your
cells to make more energy

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
producing mitochondria.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
This works best with the AI bike
that is used at upgrade labs,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
but you can do it at home.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
To get the full details on how
to do REHIT at home for free,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:90%
go to daveasprey.com.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all there for you.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:84%
There's another way to
speed up a cardio workout,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and I do it sometimes.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I strap on a mask, and
I Inhale pure oxygen

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to get more energy and
more exercise in less time.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that
breathing hyperoxic air

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
enables higher
intensity training,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and it creates significant
improvements in power output

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
compared to breathing
regular air.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
This is another hack that you
may have available to you.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And these biohacks
will become part

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
of how we transform ourselves
over the next 10 years.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
You just get early access
because you're here

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
on this episode.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
resistance training.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:10%
Inside your muscles,
you have something

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:10%
called proprioceptors.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And these are little
networks of intelligence

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that your muscles use to
know where they are in space

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:90%
and what's safe.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So your muscle
has its own brain.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Your elbow has its own brain.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
watching what

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:84%
you do to see how
much you're lifting

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:90%
in case it might be dangerous.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And since you might wobble
when you're holding a dumbbell,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.355 align:middle line:84%
then it knows that it
needs to hold back.

00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So your proprioceptors
are lying to you

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that you're safe.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
You have way more
strength than potential,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but your body won't
let you access that.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So you can use
technologies or techniques

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to show your body that you
can get past a certain level

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
so it raises your
strength threshold.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that if
you can remove or change

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that acceleration of
gravity, the things

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that your proprioceptors
are sensing,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
you can push your muscles
to those new levels.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you work out
say with dumbbells,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
you won't be tricking
your proprioceptors,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
but you can get better
results than normal

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on the
eccentric part of your lift.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
do a dumbbell curl,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
you want to go up at
whatever speed you go up,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
but you want at least 10
seconds to lower the weight.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So that means you spend
more time fighting gravity.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And you want to do
the number of reps

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
it takes to reach exhaustion,
which is usually about 10.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
do 30 or 40 reps.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
kind of exercise

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that works better than just
picking up rocks, which

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:90%
is what dumbbells really are.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
They're concentrated
rocks turned into iron.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
You can use isometric exercise.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So with this, you recruit
as many muscle fibers

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.445 align:middle line:84%
at once as you can It can even
help to lower blood pressure.

00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Isometric exercise means you're
pushing against something

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
that won't move.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You can push against
your hands like this.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
This is an isometric exercise.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can do all
sorts of things

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
even like a plank, where
you're just holding a position.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And that changes things so you
put on muscles more quickly

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
than doing things
with a normal speed.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You can stand in
a narrow hallway

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.232 align:middle line:84%
and push as hard as you
can against one wall

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:90%
or bracing against the other.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:90%
There is no gravity in there.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So your body feels that
it's safe to push harder,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
will push harder.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Another hack that
works ridiculously

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:90%
well is resistance bands.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So if now you're
lifting something

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're pushing against
a stretchy piece of latex,

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't act like
gravity, so the body

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
has to recalibrate and
readjust, and it grows muscle

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:90%
more quickly.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
My job is to teach you how
to build muscle very quickly

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
so that you can spend
less time exercising

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and more time becoming
conscious, more

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.712 align:middle line:84%
time with your kids, more
time in service to others.

00:10:51.712 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want
you to waste time

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
in the gym getting very few
results per minute of effort.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
If you just love going to
the gym, well, keep going.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.832 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
judge you for that.

00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But most of us are
balancing gym against kids,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.908 align:middle line:84%
against learning, against
work, against art,

00:11:06.908 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:90%
against all these other things.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You can do both.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And the data shows,
if you do what I just

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
said with variable
resistance elastic bands,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
you can grow muscles
about three times more

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
quickly than you would if
you were picking up barbells.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:10%
You can also use special
electrical muscle stimulation

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:10%
machines that have a unique type
of direct electrical current.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this on your
things, this is not tense.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
designed for building muscle.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You can also build muscle
three or maybe even five times

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
as fast as traditional
weightlifting.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So should you find a clinic
that does that because you

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:90%
could go there 20% as much?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that EMS does is

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to preferentially
reprogram your muscles so

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that they lengthen, so
they're more relaxed,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.495 align:middle line:84%
they're more pliable,
they're more resilient,

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and you can move through
a greater range of motion.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.828 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, if
you're all the way out here

00:11:58.828 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and you want to pick something
up, it's really hard,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to pick
it up right here.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But if there's
electricity stimulating,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get stimulated
all the way out here

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
and all the way back here.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.332 align:middle line:84%
So you're changing
the input signal,

00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
so your body will
transform more quickly.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the height of
all these technologies,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
there's something called the
Cheat Machine at Upgrade Labs.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The Cheat Machine
uses AI to monitor

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.282 align:middle line:84%
how your body is resisting and
to change the resistance based

00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%
on how you're fighting.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So instead of fighting gravity,
you're fighting an AI machine,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and your body will adapt
the quickest possible level

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.975 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever seen.

00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
that isn't really

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
in the fitness realm
when we think about it

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but belongs in
the fitness realm.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's called movement.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And so with movement, you
said, go for a walk, Dave.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, movement is about
moving in a way that

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
works to maximize your workouts
and works to reduce stress

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
If you're alive, you
have movement problems

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're likely unaware of.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a practice called
functional movement that

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
allows you to download new
software into your body's

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
operating system so that you can
access a muscle you don't even

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:90%
know is there.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you stood on
a stool, just a little stool,

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and you straighten your legs
so they're not quite locked,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
you bend down and
reach with both hands.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
If your arms aren't
exactly the same length,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.742 align:middle line:90%
something is holding you back.

00:13:23.742 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
muscle in your leg,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:90%
or your back, or your shoulder.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that it's tense
because it's invisible to you,

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
but it is.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And a functional
movement specialist

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
can help you turn on full
access to all of the muscles.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The other test that works really
well is an active leg raise.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Lay flat on your
back on the floor

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
or on a very firm surface,
and you raise one leg

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
straight as high as
you can while you

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
keep your back and
your butt on the floor.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.362 align:middle line:84%
If one or both of
your legs are weak,

00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:84%
it means you don't know
how to turn on your hip

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
flexors all the way, or you
have hamstring problems.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Limited neck mobility
is another thing.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
It comes from looking down
at your phone all day.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You can train your neck
muscles with a head

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:90%
harness with a resistance band.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that'll strengthen
the deep neck

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.545 align:middle line:84%
flexors that help you
maintain proper posture.

00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take very
long to fix your posture

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:84%
if you strengthen exactly the
right muscles in your neck.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way
to do all of this

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
is to see a functional
movement expert

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
because you'll get a very high
return on investment for this.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They'll assess you
in about an hour.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.337 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you where
your problems are

00:14:23.337 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and what specific exercises
address the muscles

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
that your body forgot about.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, just make
sure you move every day.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And play is the
best way to do that.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Walk your dog,
play with kids, do

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:90%
yoga, whatever makes you happy.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Just remember,
that's not exercise.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:90%
That's movement.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The other reason that
lifting things is important

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:90%
is bone density.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
In order to be fit and
to live a long time,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
you need to have bones
that are hard to break.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:10%
If you have a fragility
fracture after the age of 50,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:10%
you've got about a
50% chance of dying

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:10%
within one year based on
complications of that fracture.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
That means higher
bone density is

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a much better
chance of living a long time,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.505 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you better
blood glucose regulation.

00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
don't have diabetes

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
because you have dense bones.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You have a better
metabolic profile.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And how do you get denser bones?

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, strength training
is the way to do it.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
All of the hacks you
just learned about

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
will increase bone density.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
As an example, as I'm
recording this, I am 50.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd have bone
surgery a year ago.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor couldn't
cut through the bone

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:90%
with his normal saw.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, he said,
Dave, what are you doing?

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I operate on people
half your age,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and their bones cut like butter.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:90%
What's your secret?

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The secret is what you're
learning in this episode.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:10%
I also practice something
called whole body vibration.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And this is a platform you
can stand on that vibrates.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:10%
NASA uses this to cause
astronauts to build bones

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:10%
after they come back from space.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
whole body vibration

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.545 align:middle line:84%
works is that most cells in
your body are piezoelectric.

00:15:58.545 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
That means when
you vibrate them,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
they generate a little bit of
electricity on their membranes,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and that stimulates growth.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you stand on
a whole body vibration

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
platform or the
cheap version on one

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of those small mini trampolines,
although it's not as effective,

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
it unleashes piezoelectricity
in your bone cells

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:90%
so that they grow.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Even wounds can heal faster.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Another hack that is
one of my favorites

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that you'll go to a
clinic for is called PEMF.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:10%
And this is bursts of low
level magnetic frequencies that

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:10%
heal damaged tissues
and especially bone they

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:10%
can relieve injury related
pain and even stimulate organs.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
This will build
bone more quickly

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:84%
than anything else
I've ever seen.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.960 align:middle line:84%
These pulses that are
at low frequencies

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
go through your
skin and penetrate

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
deep into your muscle, into
your bones, into your tendons,

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and even organs to
activate your cells energy

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and encourage natural
repair mechanisms.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But even if you do all
of these things that

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
signal the body to
make stronger bones,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:84%
it won't work unless you have
two things that are important.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
One of them is called
vitamin DAKE, D, A, K,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
E. And this is a special blend
of vitamin D3, real vitamin

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
A that's preformed, and
specific forms of vitamin K,

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and a specific
type of vitamin E.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So vitamin D, A, K, E,
vitamin DAKE and minerals.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.045 align:middle line:84%
There are more than 20
minerals in your bones,

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:90%
and they all work together.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not about just calcium.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So vitamin DAKE tells the
minerals to go into your bones,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
the minerals present.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:84%
There is a supplement that
is magic for bone density

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that everyone should know about
if they have osteoporosis.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The supplement is called
calcium fructoborate.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It reduces inflammation,
and it protects

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
against the way inflammation
disrupts your bone.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So try calcium fructoborate if
you're working on bone density.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It takes about 30
years to lose the bone

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that you built up
when you were young.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Unlike muscle, bone
sticks around for a while.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep doing what
you learned in this episode,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
you can have bones that are
as strong when you're 80

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.087 align:middle line:90%
as they were when you were 20.

00:18:04.087 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's the goal.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's say now
that you've learned

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
how to put muscle on faster
than picking up rocks.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You've learned how to improve
your cardiovascular system

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
six times better than what
you're likely doing or not

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:90%
doing today.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And you've learned how to
build those dense bones.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
So you can become ripped.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
As I'm recording this,
I am 8.6% body fat,

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I have exceptionally
strong bones,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm lean and very muscular
but not hyper muscular.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes a week is
my exercise routine

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:90%
using all of the hacks in here.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And if I spent 40
minutes, I probably

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:90%
put on a little bit more muscle.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a big
priority for me.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy with
the way I look.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I look like I play
water polo, and I don't.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So how could I go from
weighing 300 pounds

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:90%
to going down to 8.6% body fat?

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:84%
It turns out it wasn't
from the exercise.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It was from the
episode on nutrition.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine nutrition
with fitness, magic can happen.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the mistakes
that people make

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is they believe that if you
can just exercise enough,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you'll get results.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
If you exercise every single
day, especially the same way,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
like I wake up, I go
for a five mile run,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and then I start my day.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it because you
believe that discipline,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and repeating this, and
grit and determination

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
are the things that
create results.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that getting
the right signal into your body

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
at the right time at
the right frequency

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is what causes rapid change
without the struggle,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
without the grit.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.198 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
this is triggering.

00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean I
don't have to work hard?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been working hard for
10 years on my exercise.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
What are your results?

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
If you've been exercising
consistently for 10 years,

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:90%
you probably look pretty good.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But you also spent thousands
of hours in the gym

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
spend on something

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that might have been more
important for you if you

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:90%
could have done it.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I want
you to do is to be

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
able to build the body and
the resilience of someone who

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
has exercised a lot and
didn't get very good results.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to do a
much smaller amount of time

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can spend that
extra time, maybe doing

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
public service, maybe
just spend it meditating.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you'll learn more
about that later as well.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
For every single thing you
think you have to work hard on,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
there is a way to
not work as hard.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make
the argument for you

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that you have a moral obligation
to not waste energy exercising

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
because your precious
energy can be used anywhere

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
you want to use it.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just not the highest
return on investment.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And yes, maybe I'm a little
bit upset by the fact

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that I spent 702
hours in my mid-20s

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
at the gym desperately
trying to lose weight,

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't work.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.693 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that, I believed

00:21:07.693 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
it was because I
didn't work out enough.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should have done
it seven times a week.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I had
too much lettuce.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I had
already thrown away

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
the chicken and the
dressing from the chicken

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
salad because I was
watching calories.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you change those
two things around

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
that if you exercise

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
two times a week, that
that's enough to get results.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to do
exercise every day,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
but you do need
to move every day.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So you could replace intense
exercise with a yoga class

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
because you love the
community of yoga,

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
because you like the breathwork.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
You can replace it with a
walk, which is not exercise.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:10%
These are activities
that involve movement,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:10%
but they're not brief.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't create that signal
that causes the body to change.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
yoga for a minute.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It isn't exercise.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But it is so good
for stretching,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:84%
for creating that ability to put
your ankles behind your head.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I
can do this on camera.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But how many people do you
know who, without warming up,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
can just sit like this and talk
and look completely ridiculous?

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can do that because
I learned how to eat,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
because I learned
how to stretch,

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and I learned
functional movement.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I walk around like
this all the time.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not bragging at all.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
What I'm telling you
is that if I could

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
do this as a 300 pounds computer
hacker who couldn't touch

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
his toes, who had three knee
surgeries before I was aged 25,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
if I had to come
back from all of that

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and I can do this on
20 minutes of exercise

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
a week coming from behind,
imagine what would happen

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
if you learned a little
bit more about how to eat

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and you actually spend
less time at the gym

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
than you do now with
the right tools,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if
you had more energy

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and you had more results
at the same time?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is such an
important episode for you.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So go back through it and think
to yourself, do I want cardio

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:90%
or do I want muscle?

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Where will I start?

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Which of these hacks
looks most interesting?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll start with REHIT.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll find a place that
can do the cheat machine.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, just
understand, you don't

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
have to exercise with grit and
sweat on yourself at 5:00 AM

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
every single morning.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You can if it makes you happy.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It's just not the fastest path.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Today, the world
needs people who

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
are healthy, high energy,
strong with time on their hands

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:90%
to do good work.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is Biohacking.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:90%
