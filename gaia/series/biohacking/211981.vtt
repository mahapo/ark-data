>>DAVE ASPREY: Biohacking.

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about being well.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It's about being more than well.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is Biohacking.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:10%
A part of biohacking is
resilience and recovery.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
this is that people

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
who are attracted
to biohacking, we're

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
the people who want control
over our own biology.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to bring it no matter

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:90%
what life brings our way.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to
the temptation, one

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that I've certainly fallen
to at times in my life--

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
you do more than your body
really is ready to handle.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And with biohacking,
you can do it

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
as long as you use
biohacking to then recover

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
faster and further than
mother nature normally

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:90%
would have let you.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can still hit the wall.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But with biohacking, you can
move the wall really far out.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So this episode is
all about teaching

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
you resilience and
recovery techniques

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because you may be
burned out right now.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And you may need this right now.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Or you may learn how to
stress your body even

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
more with exercise
to get great results

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
but only if you
recover properly.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So these are the things
that let you recover faster

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
in less time.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They'll let you go out
of fight or flight mode

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
into rest and reset mode
so that you can reduce

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:90%
your overall stress levels.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And that just makes you happier.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to live a long time?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.008 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how
to be happy and not

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:90%
be stressed all the time.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn how to
handle stress like a boss.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, for the first
time in recent history,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:84%
in surveys, people are
asking for stress management

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
more than they're asking
for abs or weight loss.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
This is unprecedented
because we are more

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
stressed than we've ever been.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's social media.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's government
interventions.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your mother-in-law.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Only you know what the
source of your stress is.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But, societally, it seems
like everyone has more stress

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
than they did before.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at is resilience.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Resilience means that you can
choose your state regardless

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of what happens in
the world around you.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So you can take a hit.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And you can bounce back.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And the hit could be a
change in your employment.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be some bad news.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:10%
It could be got sick
and then you recovered.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But resilient people, they
can handle hard times.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And they come back either
stronger or just as good

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
as they were before.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
weak, because they

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have the resilience
built into their biology,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
are more likely to
take a hit and then

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
fall into a victim mindset,
to fall into chronic illness,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
to fall into
depression and anxiety.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And if that's happened to
you, you can climb out.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can build a
resilient body, which

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
then leads to a resilient mind.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're someone who could
use resilience right now,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:90%
here are some signs.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a hard time going
to sleep or staying asleep.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Your resting heart rate is high.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
If you track your heart rate
variability on a sleep tracker,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
you have low heart
rate variability, which

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
is a sure sign of burnout.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel
overwhelmed all the time,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you just
can't handle whatever

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%
life is bringing your way--

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.023 align:middle line:84%
and today wasn't
even that bad anyway.

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
But you just can't handle it.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.632 align:middle line:84%
This anxiety and overwhelm,
it's not a moral failing.

00:03:43.632 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
you're a bad person.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.715 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
that you're weak.

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It means that your body
is highly stressed.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's sending
you signals to make

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you can't handle
things because it's worried

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that it can't handle things.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.467 align:middle line:84%
And that is because your
body has figured out

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't going to
take very much to throw you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:90%
into a state of disequilibrium.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Normally, your body manages
everything in the world

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
around you automatically.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.592 align:middle line:84%
But when you get tipped
too far in one direction,

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
the body feels like it
can't recover from that.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.137 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
get stuck there.

00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:16.258 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you feel
a sense of unease.

00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to make you
change what you're doing.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are good
types of stress.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of biohacking,
especially the fitness episode,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is about using stress
to craft the body

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and mind and nervous
system that you want.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.293 align:middle line:84%
Instant on or
quick on, quick off

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
stress that allows your body
to leave equilibrium and then

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:90%
come right back quickly.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
That builds more resilience.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.017 align:middle line:84%
Bad stress is when
you say, well, I'm

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
going to start exercising.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do two hours
a day for 75 days

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
straight because
I saw it online.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
That's going to put your body
into a state of disequilibrium,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
where your body doesn't return
back to equilibrium because it

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
was more stress than
you could handle then.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Or it might return.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But it might take you a year
or six weeks or six months.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:10%
Most of us get stuck in
fight or flight mode.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
When your sympathetic
nervous system is turned on

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and stays on-- sympathetic
is the part of your body

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that says, get ready for stress
and optimize for instant energy

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
availability.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't build up health.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't build up resilience.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.292 align:middle line:84%
Don't build up strength
because there's

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
a tiger in the room with you.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.083 align:middle line:84%
And why would you
invest in the future

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.498 align:middle line:90%
when there's a danger right now?

00:05:22.498 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Even though you know
there's no danger right now,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system
and your body

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:90%
believe that there's a danger.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're in
charge of themselves

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
until you take charge
of them with biohacking.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the easiest and
most surprising ways

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to build more resilience is just
to give the body the minerals,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the vitamins, fats,
proteins, amino acids

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.308 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
be able to handle

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%
what's in the world around you.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
feel stressed, make

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
sure you have nutrient
deficiencies because then

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:90%
the body feels helpless.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
there's a stressor.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I want to build more resilience.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.762 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have the
materials to build it.

00:05:59.762 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, anxiety.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Body feels anxiety
from lack of nutrients.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
You feel anxiety.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But you might blame
someone at work

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
even though your
anxiety came from you.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The number one fastest
way to build resilience

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
get better sleep.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
episode on that for you.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'll summarize some
of the things for you.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
When you sleep, especially
the first half of the night--

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
going to bed earlier
helps for this--

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
your body releases
signaling substances,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
like human growth
hormone and testosterone.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And it tells your cells
to repair and grow.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So going to bed a little bit
earlier, even if you don't want

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to, and doing some of the sleep
hacks from the episode on sleep

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
can radically improve
your resilience.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Just one night of sleep,
that's good quality sleep,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
can help you handle things
40% better the next day.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
will drive resilience

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:84%
is giving yourselves more energy
because the body with more

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
energy is less stress.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can use light
hacking for this.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:10%
Certain frequencies
of light activate

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:10%
a part of your
mitochondrial network

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:10%
called cytochrome c oxidase.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:10%
That causes your mitochondria to
make better use of ATP energy.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
don't know this.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:10%
But cytochrome c oxidase is
what's called a chromophore.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:10%
That means it's a color
sensing molecule that absorbs

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:10%
specific wavelengths of light.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it absorbs
between 600 to 800 nanometer

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
light, which means
red and infrared.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a red or
infrared light therapy device,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
you can do 20 or 30 minutes
a day with a red light panel.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It reduces inflammation,
pain, increases collagen,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
speeds wound healing.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But for resilience, put a red
light panel, and better yet

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
a red and amber light
panel, over your stomach.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And let it sit there
while you're working.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And just watch what happens
because your vagal nerve that

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
controls a lot of stress,
it goes through the gut.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can calm the body and
reduce your stress response

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.282 align:middle line:84%
just with red, infrared, and
amber light over the abdomen.

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a square
light panel that's

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
lightweight that you can get
that will go into your shirt.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can just do
that for a few minutes

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:90%
a day, even before bed.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
you're turning off

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
fight or flight using light and
turning on energy production.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:90%
More energy equals less stress.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.305 align:middle line:90%
More nutrients, less stress.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
kinds of stress

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:90%
that are not emotional stress.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But they feel like
emotional stress.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Next up, you could do what
ancient Chinese and Russian

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:90%
militaries learned to do.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
They found herbs that would
help their soldiers turn

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
on the stress response
when they needed it

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and then quickly turn it
off when they were done.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
Those herbs today are
called adaptogens.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And they can help
you resist stress.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, when
you need a stress response,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
it's effortless
to get some stress

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and effortless to turn it off.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So it makes stress feel
like less than it is.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And it helps your body
maintain that stable state.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Adaptogens will re-regulate
your endocrine system,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system,
your immune system,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
even your digestive system.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
The top three that you
should consider taking,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
things that I take, are
ashwagandha, ginseng,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and rhodiola.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
If you find a supplement with
some combination of those

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
in it, you might find
results like you'll

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:90%
find in the studies.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
One study shows
ashwagandha decreases

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
stress by 14.5% to 27.9% in
healthy but stressed people.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And eleuthero, which
is Siberian ginseng,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
amplifies immune function
and suppresses stress.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Holy basil is my
all time favorite.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
It's anti-stress.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
It even helps with high
cholesterol and depression

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:84%
if high cholesterol
is even an issue.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Adaptogens are safe for the
vast majority of people.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you're under
a lot of stress,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
you may want to
increase your doses.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And as always, check
with the doctor

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
if you're on
prescription medications.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
You could also consider
teaching your body

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.055 align:middle line:84%
to be more resilient using
cold and heat therapy.

00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
When your body
realizes you could

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
go from normal temperature to
very, very cold, as in an ice

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
bath or cryotherapy, or
to a very hot temperature,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
as in a sauna or infrared sauna,
it can improve your resilience.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Because during that
extreme cold temperature,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
only three minutes,

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:84%
your body, with
its own awareness,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of thinks, I might
die, and I might never

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
have babies if I can't
figure out how to stay warm.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So it turns on the capability
to become really warm really

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, why would that matter?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
do that, your body

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
has to go in and
find the weak cells

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and remove them and replace
them with stronger cells.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And three days of cold showers
or ice baths or cryotherapy

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:10%
is all it takes to change
the amount of cardiolipin

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:10%
in your mitochondrial membrane.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
the science behind that.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But what that means is
your body becomes better

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
at making heat, which
means it becomes

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
better metabolically,
which means

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
you can handle more stress.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
For more than 10
years, I've been

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
writing about how you
can cool specific body

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
parts to increase endurance
and strength output just

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:90%
for local areas.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But a whole body ice bath
or whole body cold shower

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
can do wonders for you.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing
saunas and then ice,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:84%
you always do the
sauna first and the ice

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
last so that your body has to
learn how to warm itself up.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you're completely
blown out by stress today,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe you don't need to
freeze as well because cold

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.837 align:middle line:90%
is a stressor on the body.

00:11:32.837 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're already at
the very end of your rope,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's not what
you need right now.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:90%
And here's a hack for you.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.753 align:middle line:84%
It's expensive to go to
the convenience store

00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and buy a bunch of ice and
throw it in your bathtub.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.795 align:middle line:90%
It takes a long time.

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And almost no one's
going to do that.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And if there's not
a local clinic that

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
offers cryotherapy,
which is what I prefer,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
here's the hack for you.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Get a salad bowl as
big as your face.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Put an inch of water in it.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Freeze it.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The next morning or
the next evening,

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:84%
whenever you want
to do ice therapy,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
put some cold tap water
in on top of the ice

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.812 align:middle line:90%
until the water is very cold.

00:12:06.812 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:90%
You take a deep breath.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.645 align:middle line:90%
And you bend forward.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And you stick your face,
just your face, in the water.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And keep it there
as long as you can.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.618 align:middle line:84%
And then when you need
to breathe, take it out.

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:16.418 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Put it back in.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.743 align:middle line:90%
Aim for doing a minute or two.

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
You won't make it
a minute or two.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll make it about 20
seconds if you're lucky.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And after that, you'll
say, cold headache.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Why did Dave tell me to do this?

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, just keep doing
it for three days.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And on the fourth day, it'll
magically be just fine.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when your mitochondrial
membrane became more resilient.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you're using sauna
as part of your resilience,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:10%
a sauna will create something
called heat shock proteins that

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:10%
help to repair
misfolded proteins that

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:10%
make you stronger.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We used to think you had
to replace bad proteins.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
with enough heat,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
the body will unfold
a protein that's

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
malfunctioning and then
refold it properly,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:90%
which is super cool.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It also lowers blood pressure,
improves circulation,

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:84%
helps relaxation, and
increases tissue oxygenation.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
All of those decrease anxiety
and increase resilience

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So should you do 20 minutes
of sauna three times a week?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Should you do one to three
minutes of cold shower or ice

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:90%
or cryo most days of the week?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to
make you live longer?

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Almost certainly.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.735 align:middle line:84%
It'll certainly make
you live better.

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:25.015 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
breathwork that can have

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
profound effects on resilience.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the gold standards is
used by special forces and Navy

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:90%
SEALs.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's called box breath.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it right now.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%
You're going to breathe out.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
breathe in for five seconds.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
You can hold for five.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to breathe
out for five slowly.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:90%
You're going to hold for five.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:90%
1 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you continue that
cycle for 6 or 10 breaths,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
it will take your body out
of fight or flight mode

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
and put you into rest and reset.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It literally resets
your nervous system.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a more advanced breath
called ujjayi breath from yoga

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:90%
that works very, very well.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
To do this, you breathe
in through your nose.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And you constrict
your throat, kind

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:90%
of like you're about to snore.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds like a seashell.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people call this
the seashell breath.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do this,
it'll sound like this.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You breathe slowly
through the nose.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You can breathe
out the same way.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
That will very quickly
put you to sleep at night.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take you out of
a very stressful situation.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do it a
little bit quieter,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
even in a meeting with your
boss when he's being a jerk.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So remember box breath
and ujjayi breath.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
You can do either one
of them at a stoplight.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
doing cold therapy,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.325 align:middle line:84%
there are specific
styles of breathing

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to teach
you in the time we have here,

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
things like Wim Hof style
breathing or Tibetan fire

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
breaths that can make
cold therapy easier to do.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:10%
Another thing that
works really, really

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:10%
well is if you're carrying a
lot of stress in your body,

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:10%
you can lie on the floor
on your back, which

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:10%
allows your blood pressure
to return to baseline more

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:10%
quickly.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And you do box breathing
at the same time

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:90%
only through your nose.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.588 align:middle line:84%
That is sort of
the very big gun.

00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to do this
at work probably unless you

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:90%
have a place to lie down.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
On your back, in and
out, five seconds

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:90%
on each side of the box.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.295 align:middle line:84%
And you will very quickly
feel like you took a nap.

00:15:48.295 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's controlling all
of this stress in the body?

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a nerve
called the vagus nerve

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:90%
or the wandering nerve.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest
nerve in your body.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And it controls fight
or flight and rest

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and reset, your sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And it starts in the brain,
goes down through your neck,

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and innervates your entire gut.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's a single nerve.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And when that's working well,
then you have less stress.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.112 align:middle line:84%
When it's not working well,
your heartbeat changes.

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And a bunch of
other things happen.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to teach you
here how to change your heart

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
rate variability because that's
something that matters greatly.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you control
over your vagal nerve.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So your heart beats
are not all equal.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
In a healthy person
without stress,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
your heart rate
isn't evenly spaced.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.587 align:middle line:84%
If you have 60 beats per minute
and there's one every second,

00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:90%
you're actually really stressed.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you have 60
beats per minute

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're kind of
randomly distributed

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
over that 60 seconds, you're
exceptionally healthy.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
changing your heart rate.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
changing how your heart

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:90%
rate is spread around.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So increasing your heart rate
or lowering your resting heart

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.305 align:middle line:90%
rate, that's not this.

00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a measure of stress.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
And you can teach
yourself to adapt

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
to sudden physical and
psychological challenges

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
by having a higher
heart rate variability.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That directly correlates to
an adaptable nervous system.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
If you have an anxiety
disorder, excessive cortisol,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you have inflammation, or
you're just overtraining

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and under sleeping
or drinking a lot,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
your heart rate
variability will go down.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't recover
from your last workout,

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:90%
heart rate variability is low.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:10%
And you can measure
heart rate variability

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:10%
in the morning on most
sleep trackers today.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
You can even find technology
online with biofeedback

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that lets you directly train
your heart rate variability

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:84%
if the breathwork
you just learned

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't already do it for you.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
If you target your vagus
nerve, as a biohacker,

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
you can raise heart
rate variability.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:10%
If you increase the strength
of your vagal nerve, which

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:10%
is called vagal tone, it
increases your heart rate

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:10%
variability.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways to
increase your vagal tone

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is cold therapy on
your face and neck,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
like the trick you
just learned about,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:90%
also singing and humming.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.293 align:middle line:84%
Literally, [HUMS],, that
can make a difference.

00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, do it for five minutes.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.793 align:middle line:90%
And see how you feel.

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
This is something I think
people used to do in the shower.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like now we
just listen to something.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:90%
But maybe you should sing along.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, deep breathing,
like we just did,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
will also help target
the vagal nerve.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
There are new technologies
on the market now

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that use vibration over
your wrists or ankles

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
or sternum to stimulate
your vagus nerve.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And they have profound effects
on your stress response.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling like
you need a hug, like you're

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
lacking touch, sometimes
that stimulation

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:90%
will replicate a hug.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Or you could always increase
your heart rate variability

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
with a really good eight-second
hug that raises oxytocin.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
That always works if you
have huggable friends.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Another hack for making
your body resilience

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
is called whole body vibration.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, NASA's been using
this to train astronauts

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to recover better after
they lose muscle and bone

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
mass in space.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
So they come back.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they get on
these vibration platforms.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You can find them at some
biohacking facilities.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And you might have one at home.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Cells in your body
are piezoelectric.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:10%
It means when you vibrate
them or flex them,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:10%
they generate a little
tiny bit of electricity

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:10%
that can help your
body be more resilient.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Whole body vibration promotes
wound healing and bone density,

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
moves oxygen around
inside the body.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It helps to drain
your lymph system.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
When you do those things,
your body feels less stress.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.355 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, you
feel less stress.

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Another big gun is
hyperbaric oxygen.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
This is when you go into
a pressurized chamber.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And you breathe 100%
oxygen. Speeds up

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
wound healing, heals
traumatic brain injuries,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and it briefly increases the
production of reactive oxygen

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is oxidative stress.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's brief.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So it stimulates your stem
cells to make more stem cells.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They're using this
in doctor's offices

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
now after stroke
and brain injuries.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But it can help healthy
brains work better.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And studies in humans
who are perfectly healthy

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
showed daily hyperbaric
improved memory performance.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And it enhances functional
connectivity in different parts

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Also, it'll turn on
mitochondrial biogenesis.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The more mitochondria you have,
the more resilient you are.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it actually reduces
pro-inflammatory markers

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that
vibration or other therapies

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
like that that briefly cause
stress but allow the body

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to recover, they
build resilience.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to understand how
to take yourself out of stress

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.953 align:middle line:84%
and how to briefly introduce
stress and then take it out

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's also ozone therapy.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
This has been used
for over 150 years

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
for sterilizing wounds
and treating infections.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a source of mild
oxidative stress.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is
activate a pathway called Nrf2

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:90%
that's important for longevity.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And it helps your body make more
antioxidants, like glutathione.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:10%
It upregulates
heat shock protein

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:10%
much like doing a sauna does.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And that helps to
fix protein folding.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:10%
It stimulates flow of
oxygen across cell membranes

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:10%
so your cells are
more oxygenated.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And it makes your
mitochondria more efficient

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:10%
at making energy.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:84%
In order to access
ozone therapy,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:90%
you can go to a doctor's office.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can do 10
pass intravenous ozone

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
for systemic effects.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do ozone therapy
at home via variety of ways.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
There's videos on
my page about that.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
information online

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
about doing ozone therapy.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Do not breathe ozone gas.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not good for your lungs.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do
is stimulate your body

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
with these intense stressors
for very brief periods of time.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And then make sure you
return back to baseline.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:90%
These build resilience.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you're already out
of the resilient state

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're stressed,
use what you just

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
learned in this episode in
order to bring yourself back

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:90%
down into an unstressed state.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Become comfortable
in that state.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then do these
little stressors.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:90%
And then recover quickly.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
We are wired, especially
as biohackers,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, if some stress
is good, more stress is better.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just going to lean in.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to push through.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
grit and determination.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
that we all want.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And these are good things
to be able to turn on.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:10%
But when you turn
them on and leave them

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:10%
on all the time, which is
what I did in my early career,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:10%
you are guaranteeing burnout.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So your job is to
dance with the edge

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and to constantly
move the edge out

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
so you have more and
more and more capacity.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And one day, you wake up
and go, I have way more

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:90%
energy than everyone around me.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
As a biohacker,
you get to dial in

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
whether you're going to have
more stress that's good for you

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
or more stress that's
not good for you.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.340 align:middle line:84%
You get to choose how your
body responds to stress.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you taking adaptogens?

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Or are you not?

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Did you catch yourself getting
stressed for no good reason

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and do a box breath?

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
These are tools that are
available to all humans.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:10%
They don't cost very much.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:10%
And many of them are free.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
The reason I want you to
become a devoted biohacker

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no
faster path to putting you

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:90%
in charge of your own biology.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So you get to decide
how you show up.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, who
knows what you might do?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And this is biohacking.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:90%
