Nutrition isn't just about
carbs and fats and proteins.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the type of
carbs, the type of fat,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and the type of protein that
makes all the difference.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Different proteins
do different things

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.685 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to learn
which ones you want to eat.

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You need fat because it's
what makes you feel full

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's what your
hormones are made out of.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And not all fats
are created equal.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Different fats have
different properties.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And when oxygen atoms
can stick to a molecule,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:90%
it can create a free electron.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called reactive
oxygen species.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where inflammation
comes from in your body.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Some fats are more subject
to that than others.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Animal fats are different
than plant fats.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Saturated fats don't have
places where oxygen can stick,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:90%
so they're very stable.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
polyunsaturated fats, or PUFAs,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of places where
oxygen molecules can stick.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
They're less stable
and they're not

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
what your body is built out of.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the less stable
the fat that you eat is,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the less stable the
fat in your body

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
is, including your white fat,
which means more inflammation.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you want
to shift your fats

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
towards the ones that work
better because they keep

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:90%
your body from being inflamed.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Monounsaturated fats are less
stable than saturated fats,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but you still need some of
those, things like olive oil.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Polyunsaturated fats, like corn
oil, vegetable oil, canola oil,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
all the nut and seed oils, the
plant-based oils, for the most

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:90%
part, are polyunsaturated.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you minimize
those in your diet,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you find that suddenly,
everything works again.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very important
point that a lot of times people

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:90%
don't talk about.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So high fat or low
fat, it doesn't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
matter if you don't
know what kind of fat.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Although those omega-3s
and omega-6s are unstable,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
your body needs a
small amount of those,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
but a very small amount.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And today, because
they're cheaper,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
restaurants and
big food companies

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
feed you a lot of
omega-6s and that's

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
behind a lot of the problems
you're having right now.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The best saturated
fats you can eat

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
are grass-fed tallow, butter,
ghee, MCT oil, coconut oil,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
or, if you're not allergic,
raw, full fat dairy products.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:90%
That can change your life.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The good monounsaturated fats
would be whole avocados not

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
extracted avocado oil,
extra virgin olive oil,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
or there's a new kind of oil
called cultured oil, which

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is highly stable and purely
monounsaturated-- a lot

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
of restaurants are
starting to use that.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Polyunsaturated omega-3s, the
things that you want to take,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
are high-quality krill
oil, wild seafood,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually get
omega-3s from grass-fed beef

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
or lamb because fish has a lot
of mercury and microplastic

concerns that it didn't
have 25 years ago.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It turns out,
grass-fed ruminants

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:90%
are your secret weapon.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to polyunsaturated
omega-6s, seconds

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:10%
you really want to avoid canola,
soybean, sunflower, safflower,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:10%
cottonseed, and peanut oils.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Limit the amount of pork
you eat, and chicken fat

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and poultry fat also is
high in the kind of fat

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:90%
that leads to inflammation.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Our Western diet has become
very high in omega-6 fats

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
over the past 30 years
right as our obesity levels

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%
went through the roof.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:84%
There is so much omega-6
in the Western diet

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
right now that you don't have
to make sure you get enough,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
the trick is to eat
as little as you can

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and you'll still get
some no matter what.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
You'll even find omega-6 in
foods like grass-fed beef

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's there in a
couple percentage points.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you need omega-6s, but
not as much as you're getting.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
There are also
artificial trans fats.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
These are
chemically-modified seed oils

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and you never want to eat those.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And right now, most foods
in the United States

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have those taken out except
they leave small amounts.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So if it says
vegetable oils, you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
don't really know how
much of it is trans fat.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Trans fats and omega-6
fats will increase

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
your risk of stroke, heart
disease, type 2 diabetes,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and obesity.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They also change a ratio
that's really important.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Your total
cholesterol isn't that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
well-correlated with
any kind of disease,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
but what's very
important is how much

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
HDL do you have versus LDL.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Trans fats wreck the
ratio so that you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
don't have the protective HDL.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
If you eat the way I'm
teaching you in this episode,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
you will raise your
HDL levels, which

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
are the protective
kind of cholesterol.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
There are also studies that
link artificial trans fats

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to various cancers, pregnancy
complications, and even

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.565 align:middle line:90%
less brain function.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about protein.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Protein is found in
every part of your body.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It builds and gives structure
to tissues, organs, and muscles.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
It also forms antibodies so that
you can fight off infections.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It makes hemoglobin so
that your blood works,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and it creates your
hormones, and so much more.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Here's what you need
to know about proteins.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:10%
Proteins are made out of
something called amino acids--

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:10%
you've probably heard of
those on an ad somewhere.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Amino acids are like
letters in the alphabet.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you string letters
together to make a word,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that's something
called a peptide, which

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
is a fraction of a protein.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
When you have a whole
sentence, that's

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
actually a piece of
protein, like a piece

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:90%
of chicken breast or something.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So you have letters, you have
words, and you have sentences.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And normally, we
eat the sentences

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and then our bodies
break them down

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:90%
into peptides or amino acids.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And different types of proteins
have different peptides,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
different words that tell
your body what to do,

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and they have different amino
acids-- building blocks.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a
plant-based protein that's

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
not very similar to
yours, you might not

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
have the amino acid
letters you would

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
need to build up the kind of
proteins you want in your body.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
You want at least 20% of
your total daily calories

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%
from protein.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Another way of looking
at that is about 30 grams

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
of protein per meal.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:10%
And this needs to be
good-quality protein

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:10%
because high-quality
protein comes

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:10%
from grass-fed beef,
lamb, eggs, collagen

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:10%
protein, grass-fed
whey concentrate, dairy

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:10%
if you can handle dairy, and
even a small amount of organ

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:10%
meat.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:10%
You could have A2
raw cow's milk.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:90%
You could have sheep.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:90%
You can have goat.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
You could even eat a little
bit of pasteurized pork,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
but not too much.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
You want to limit your
poultry because it

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
has too much of the bad fat.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And you want to limit
your farmed seafood

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because it has high amounts
of polychlorinated biphenyls,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:90%
or PCBs and mercury.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
What you do want
to eat is bivalves.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Mussels, oysters,
clams, or younger fish

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
that are smaller so they
have less time to build up

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
mercury in their bodies.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Wild sockeye salmon is one of
the best fishes you could eat.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
You want to avoid plant-based
meat substitutes, and that's

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
because they have
very little protein,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and the protein they
have comes from plants.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.355 align:middle line:84%
If you would eat 30 grams
of animal-based protein,

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
you would get the
benefits of it.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
30 grams of plant-based
protein doesn't

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
provide the same amino acids,
the same building blocks.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Big food companies will
tell you that this plant

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
protein is the
same as this animal

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:90%
protein "because protein."

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Plant proteins also
have the problem

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of being high in toxic
heavy metals, like arsenic.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Brown rice protein is
usually high in arsenic.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And all plant proteins come
packaged with anti-nutrients.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:84%
This is how plants protect
themselves from us eating them.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Since they can't run away,
they coat their proteins

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in things that
inflame our bodies.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
You can have some plants--

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
you eat the plants, but to
concentrate those proteins

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
instead of eating the proteins
that are compatible with us

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.935 align:middle line:90%
isn't a great idea.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And then we get to carbs.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Your main source of carbs
should be vegetables.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that most
plants are out to get you.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't have claws
or legs to run away.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.298 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
believe me, if you

00:08:57.298 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:84%
were to go outside
right now and just

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
pick a plant from your front
yard or from the forest

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and eat a couple bites
of it-- don't do this,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
profound stomach aches

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and could even go
to the hospital.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.548 align:middle line:84%
That's how plants
really treat us.

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that something is
plant-based or not plant-based,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
You need to know exactly what
it is and what it does to you.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
anti-nutrients that

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is just running havoc
across our society right now

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:90%
is called phytic acid.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Plants use phytic acid to bind
to calcium, iron, magnesium,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:90%
chromium, manganese, and zinc.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the minerals that
your body needs in order

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:90%
to function every day.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So the plants know if they
steal these minerals from you,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
over time, they'll
be less humans,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
so therefore, there
can be more plants.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And phytic acid
creates phytate when

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.882 align:middle line:84%
it binds to those
minerals, and then

00:09:45.882 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
your body can absorb the
minerals in your diet,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
but it'll literally suck
them from your bones

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:90%
and from your tissues.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is why a lot
of times as people age,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
they start breaking
their hips, they

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%
start breaking their bones.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing an epidemic
of bone density problems

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
even in young people because
we're eating plants high

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
in phytic acid and we're not
getting enough minerals even

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to make enzymes.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Where does phytic
acid come from?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Nuts, seeds, beans legumes,
whole grains, soy, corn.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And most of all, oats.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Your oat milk is
not a good decision.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
osteoporosis, we're

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
seeing an epidemic of
metabolic dysfunction

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
because when your body
needs a mineral in order

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to make your cells make
energy and the mineral just

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
isn't there because a plant
stole it because someone

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
tricked you into eating more
plants and less meat, well,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to be
tired, and your system

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:84%
won't work well, and you will
be metabolically dysregulated.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what happened to
me when I weighed 300 pounds.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that plants make
is something called lectins.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.535 align:middle line:84%
And lectins are something
that may interfere

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
with your absorption
of minerals,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
but these are
little proteins that

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
stick to the types of sugars
that line your joints, line

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:90%
your arteries.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone is sensitive
to every type of lectin,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
but most of us have
some sensitivities.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If you eat a food that
your ancestors never ate,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:90%
you're likely to have problems.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
If you eat a food that
your ancestors have

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
eaten for thousands
of years, you're

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:90%
less likely to have problems.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:10%
But if you're
sensitive to a lectin--

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:10%
and lectins can come in any
of those types of plants,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:10%
but specifically nightshade
vegetables and nuts

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:10%
and seeds and grains
are very high in them,

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:10%
those lectins can
create microscopic holes

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:10%
in your intestinal wall.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Nightshade vegetables,
which is one of the largest

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
sources of lectins
that are aggressive,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
they make lectin that
can stick to glucosamine

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the compound
found in your joints.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:10%
So if you find you always have
joint pain and inflammation

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:10%
and sore muscles, you
might want to look

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:10%
at whether white potatoes,
eggplants, peppers,

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and tomatoes, and chili
peppers, maybe that's

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.653 align:middle line:10%
kryptonite for you,
but maybe it isn't

00:11:51.653 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:10%
kryptonite for someone else.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
suspect foods.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Another major
problem and something

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that affected me when I
was a raw vegan before I

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
learned better is something
called oxalic acid or oxalates.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:84%
If you look in raw spinach,
kale, rhubarb, even

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
raw almonds, these are
relatively high in oxalic acid,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
which, when you eat it, it
circulates in your blood

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and it finds calcium.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And it binds to
calcium and forms

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:90%
tiny razor-sharp crystals.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And those get deposited
in your joints.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a major cause of gout.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
In your kidneys it's a major
cause of kidney stones today.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And they can cause systemic
pain in other ways.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that raw
spinach and raw kale

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.072 align:middle line:84%
smoothie or that
green powder, you

00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
thought because it
was plant-based,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:84%
it was good for
you, but it may be

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.793 align:middle line:84%
why you get that
afternoon brain fog, why

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
your joints hurt all the time,
why your muscles are always

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:90%
tense.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes getting rid
of the suspect foods

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel better.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So what vegetables
should you eat?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Steamed broccoli,
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
carrots, cucumbers, squash,
those work for most people.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And now let's talk about
the other sources of starch

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
or carbohydrate because
your body does not need

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:90%
to be in ketosis all the time.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%
That is a myth.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.148 align:middle line:84%
You can use ketosis
to lose weight,

00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
but then you want
to have some carbs.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you do
for long periods of time

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
because it breaks almost
everyone's biology eventually.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So where do you get your carbs
without getting all those plant

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:90%
toxins?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a major problem.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best source
of carbs is white rice.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And white rice has the toxic
aggressive part, the brown part

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of the rice removed.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, fiber was removed,
too, you ate some broccoli,

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
you have plenty of fiber.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Plantains are very good.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Butternut squash is good.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Sweet potato is
good unless you're

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:90%
very sensitive to oxalates.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And the fruits that are lower in
fructose, like berries, lemons,

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
limes, and even raw
honey is a good source

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
of carbohydrate for you.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that you don't
hear much about these days

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
is prebiotic fiber.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's heard of fiber
because of ads for Metamucil

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
that are like sawdust.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something different
called prebiotic fiber,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is food for
the good gut bacteria

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
grow in your stomach.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
When you eat
prebiotic fiber, you

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
grow the good guys that
produce short-chain fatty

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
acids, something
like butyrate, which

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
is shown in studies
to strengthen

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
your brain and your gut.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So eat the stuff that's
food for the good guys,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:84%
more good guys grow, and
then they make things

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:90%
that your body needs.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty amazing thing.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a
study in the Netherlands

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that showed there
was a 9% reduced risk

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of total death for every
10 grams of prebiotic fiber

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:90%
in people's diets.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.582 align:middle line:84%
So 10 grams is not a
lot of prebiotic fiber.

00:14:36.582 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You can get it from food or
you can even take a supplement.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:10%
Prebiotic fiber is going to
be found in Brussels sprouts,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:10%
asparagus, even coffee.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
If you make it with a metal
filter, it has prebiotic fiber.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate has prebiotic fiber.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think you should consider
using a prebiotic fiber

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.452 align:middle line:84%
in a powder form because
it makes it very easy,

00:14:55.452 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and then you know you've always
got food for the good guys.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That alone could
shift your weight.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
There are other food toxins
that are part of my diet plan

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
because some of us are
more sensitive than others.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
ones is histamine.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:10%
And we've all heard of
histamine because you take

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:10%
Benadryl as an antihistamine.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:90%
We all hear about allergies.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But histamine is a
signaling molecule

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
in the body that
says, get inflamed

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
because there's a threat.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, bacteria in
food make histamine.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So some foods, when they start
to break down-- even just

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
leftovers overnight in the
fridge, things like fish

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
or pork or soy,
overnight leftovers

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.388 align:middle line:84%
can have histamine
because bacteria got going

00:15:33.388 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and the bacteria
are making histamine

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
so that we won't eat them.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
If you eat a food that's
high in histamine, it's

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
going to trigger your own
body's allergic response,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and many people,
especially post-pandemic,

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
if they're dealing with long
COVID or any other things

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
like that, people
who've had toxic molds,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.518 align:middle line:84%
those high-histamine foods
are seriously a problem.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And you eat one, you get brain
fog, you get itchy, you cough,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
your nose runs, and you
can even become inflamed

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and get muffin top from that.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So knowing this
may be in your food

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
helps you know why that food
created that feeling in you.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.273 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that people
get sensitive to histamine

00:16:06.273 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in food is because
they don't make

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
enough DAO, which is the enzyme
that breaks down histamine.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And you could test
yourself by eating

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of histamine-rich
foods and seeing how you feel.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Cook some fish, let it sit
in the fridge for two days,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and then eat it.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
You also could just
eat fish sauce.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%
You could have smoked meat.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You could have shellfish and
leftovers or soy sauce, which

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
is also very high in histamine.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
If you get heartburn, runny
nose, nausea, coughing,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
sinus issues, itchy skin,
rashes, sensitivity to light,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
inability to sleep,
brain fog, you

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
can take the DAO
enzyme as a supplement,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
or you could even take a small
piece of a Benadryl capsule

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:90%
if you know you've been exposed.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
My goal is that when
you're done eating a meal,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
you feel better than
before you ate the meal

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get a
crash and a sugar craving

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
a half hour or an hour
later, and sometimes knowing

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:90%
about histamine is the trick.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.925 align:middle line:84%
The other problem
that's in food,

00:17:02.925 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and something I'm
very well known

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
for because I made a coffee
that was free of toxin mold,

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:84%
is that mold toxins are
common in our food supply.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
Aflatoxins are the
most famous ones.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They can cause DNA damage
and liver cancer in humans.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the most
cancer-causing substance

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:90%
we've found so far.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It's made by mold that
grows on peanuts and wheat.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
Common sources of mycotoxins
include grains, corn, peanuts,

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
nuts, coffee, chocolate,
and beer and wine.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
In the US and Canada,
there are no limits

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
on mold toxins found in coffee
even though in Japan and China

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and Europe, there are limits.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes the
world's lowest-quality,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
highest-mold foods
get sent to the US,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and then we drink our
coffee or we drink our wine

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or we eat our grains, and
then we don't feel very good,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and our gut is off, and
it's just not a great day.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It can be because
of mold toxins.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
If you eliminate high-mold foods
like grains, nuts, legumes,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and even alcohol,
and you replace them

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
with organic grass-fed
beef and dairy,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and you get high-quality,
lab-tested, clean coffee,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe even with added minerals
that would be really, really

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
good for you, the difference
in a bad cup of moldy coffee

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and a good cup of
coffee is profound.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:10%
You also find that glyphosate
is in a lot of food,

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:10%
especially in the US and Canada.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Glyphosate, also known
as Roundup, is a toxin.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It destroys soil.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:90%
and.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It accumulates in fat
and neurological tissues.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It disrupts your gut microbiome.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's linked to cancer, in
fact, in multiple lawsuits.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Even worse, it modifies
your mitochondrial membrane.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
This is an internal
part of your cell

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that makes electricity
and makes sex hormones.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're poisoning
ourselves with small amounts

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of glyphosate in our food, our
energy production goes down,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and then you just don't feel as
good in everything feels hard.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to eat food that
makes everything feel easy.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Glyphosate also acts
as an anti-nutrient

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because it binds to essential
minerals that your body needed.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So the plants are already
doing that to you, we're

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.650 align:middle line:84%
adding glyphosate
to them so that when

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
you eat that wheat that was
sprayed with glyphosate,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
you're losing even
more minerals.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, it does
kill bacteria and topsoil,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately, it
also kills earthworms.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So you really want to
choose organic food.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
You want to avoid grains,
especially in the US,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
because even organic
grains now can

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:90%
have high levels of glyphosate.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
we're using so much of it

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that it gets into the water
and gets recirculated.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Wash your vegetables well.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Choose organic, grass-fed,
grass-finished beef

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because it has the
lowest glyphosate.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Another thing
that's really going

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
to change your brain
function and make you fat

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
is artificial additives
like sweeteners.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
They disrupt your gut bacteria,
things like sucralose,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
things like Nutrasweet
or aspartame.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.352 align:middle line:84%
They are provably bad
for you and there's

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
no reason to eat
them because there

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
are natural things like
monkfruit that work

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:90%
just fine that don't do that.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Artificial colorings are
linked to brain problems,

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
especially in kids.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
to use fake colors

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:90%
except that they're cheap.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not worth trading
off your ability

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to focus and pay attention to
have a special color in a food.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Artificial flavors almost
universally disrupt

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
systems in the body,
you don't want them.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
MSG, even when it's not
labeled as MSG on a label,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
will cause food
cravings after a meal.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is that MSG

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:90%
causes your neurons to fire.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And too much glutamate,
which is the G in MSG,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
will overexcite your
neurons even to the point

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that some of your
brain neurons can die.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And how do if it's MSG?

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, MSG has about 75
different code words,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:84%
but if it says "natural
flavorings" or "spice

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
extracts," there's MSG in it
even if they don't tell you.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So more grass-fed animals,
less bad oils, less chemicals,

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and the right kinds
of starch, but how

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
do you know how
much of this to eat?

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you follow
this type of diet,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
your body will naturally
regulate your hunger.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
There is no benefit to
counting calories at all.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.662 align:middle line:90%
Here's proof.

00:21:19.662 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
When I was creating
The Bulletproof Diet,

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just
disrupt this idea

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that calories in and calories
out made a difference.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So I said I was going to
eat 4,000 calories a day,

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I was going to stop
exercising, and I

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
was going to limit my sleep
to five hours a night.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was only going
to do it for a month.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And for that month, I thought I
would maybe gain 2 or 3 pounds,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
but the math would say I
should gain a lot more,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to talk about
how different calories do

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I lost weight.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And I kept doing it
for more than a year

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and I grew abs, which is
completely ridiculous.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not good for
you to overeat,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm telling
you is if you

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
eat the right kinds of foods,
you will regulate your hunger,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's very, very
hard to gain weight.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
A cyclical keto diet
is a really good idea

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:90%
if you're trying to lose weight.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Now unending keto
trashes your thyroid

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
because it lowers
your T3 hormone.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this over and
over in men and women.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.615 align:middle line:84%
You go on the Keto
diet, including me.

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You feel really
good, so then you

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
decide you'll always be on it.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while,
things aren't good anymore.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
This is why I've been teaching
for more than 10 years,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:84%
go into ketosis,
go out of ketosis.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Go in, go out.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And this allows your body to
stay in a lower stress level

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get a
big spike in cortisol.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You can become metabolically
inflexible to the point

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
where your cells don't handle
carbohydrates very well if you

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
never eat carbs.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Before we called it that,
I tried The Carnivore Diet.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And I went for three
months on meat only.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, meat and coffee.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And I did not have enough carbs
to maintain my gut lining.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So what I ended up
with was leaky gut,

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
my sleep quality
was dysregulated,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
my cortisol levels
were too high,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and it took me a while
to recover from that.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why I highly
recommend that you schedule

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:90%
a carb-up a few days a week.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you're an athlete
training heavy or a woman,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:84%
you might need to have
carbs twice a week

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.295 align:middle line:84%
even though your lower-carb
on the other days.

00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And you might do
a week of ketosis,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
but don't do months of ketosis
because it will break you.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So keto is like a
scalpel, you don't

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:90%
want to use it all the time.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But most important
of all this, you've

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
got to find your
personal kryptonite.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Not all people respond
the same way to all foods.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So you may be sitting there,
and your husband or your wife,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
they can eat something,
and when you eat it,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
like wow, I get inflammation
and I get muffin top.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm bloated, my
brain doesn't work.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
the food is good or bad,

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.995 align:middle line:84%
it means it was compatible with
you or not compatible with you.

00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing
The Elimination Diet,

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:10%
you will need only Green
Zone foods for two weeks.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:10%
And you can download
the diet for free.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:10%
Go to daveasprey.com/roadmap.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:10%
And what that'll do is tell
you everything on one page.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Good proteins, bad proteins.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Good carbs, bad carbs.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Just eat from the top of it.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of two
weeks, see how you feel.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And you might feel amazing.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you can add
some foods back.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you add
those foods back in,

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
you can test your pulse to see
if you're allergic to them.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So you get your pulse
when you wake up,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or even a pulse before
a meal-- usually

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
your watch will do
that these days.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And then 30 minutes, 60 minutes,
and 90 minutes after a meal,

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
take your heart rate.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:84%
If it goes up by
17 beats a minute,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
you were sensitive to something
in the meal that you just had.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:90%
You can also get blood tests.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
There are other
ways of doing this,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but seriously, two weeks
of eating super clean,

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
limited, just to get
rid of all the suspects,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
see how your brain works, see
how you feel, see how you look,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:90%
see how your pants fit.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You might be amazed
to realize something

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.242 align:middle line:84%
that you enjoy is
really not good for you,

00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
so you want to find something
else you enjoy even more that

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel amazing.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
The best test of
all, though, is when

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
you wake up in the morning,
is your brain turned on?

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Are your joints stiff?

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Does your back hurt?

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like crawling out
of bed or jumping out of bed?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:84%
When you dial your food
in at lunch, at dinner

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the day before, when you wake
up, your body feels amazing.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.220 align:middle line:84%
By now, you might have
noticed that a lot

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
of the foods that advertisers
have told you are healthy,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
things like plant-based, which
is another word for highly

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
processed, things
like plant-based oils,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
those are not doing
you any favors.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you look around, we
have more obesity on the planet

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
than we ever have before,
and we're eating less meat

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands-- actually,
tens of thousands of studies

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:84%
looking at protein
quality, and the reality

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is that when you add
more animal-based protein

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and animal-based fats to your
diet, you will be healthier.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:84%
There's an orchestrated campaign
to convince you to give those

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
up, and when you do it
reliably, you lose muscles,

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you lose bone density, and you
become a weaker human being.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:84%
My job is to teach you how to
eat the foods that give you

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
so much energy that
at the end of the day,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
you still have some left over.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can use that energy
to upgrade yourself,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:90%
to transform yourself.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:90%
That's why eating is important.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about how much energy you
have to bring to the world,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
it's not about how you look.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
You will lose weight
as a side effect

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
if you need to lose weight, if
you eat to have maximum energy.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:90%
And it is so liberating.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Having lost the 100 pounds
myself, but more importantly,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
having turned my brain back
on, your brain requires energy.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And if your body is hoarding
energy by storing fat,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because you're giving it
toxins, because you're

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.053 align:middle line:84%
eating the wrong stuff for
you, then of course your brain

00:26:39.053 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to have all the
energy you want to have.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to feel
amazing all the time.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is such an
important episode for you.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is "Biohacking."

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:90%
