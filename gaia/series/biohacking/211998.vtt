00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Biohacking.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
being well, it's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
about being more than well.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is Biohacking.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:10%
People call me the
father of biohacking.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Part of that's because I
did all the things that

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to work to help
me lose 100 pounds to learn

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:90%
how to be happy.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I became famous.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make me happy.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I became wealthy.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make me happy.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Lost all the money.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Didn't make me any
more or less happy.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, I
went to Nepal and Tibet

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and I studied with various
gurus around the planet.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I did daily breathwork
advanced practices, for more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:90%
than five years, advanced yoga.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:84%
And I studied Native
American practices

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and South American practices,
traditional Chinese practices.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that
spirituality is intrinsically

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
linked with being human.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not you
have a religion

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
or you don't, there's a
spiritual side to being human.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's also tied to longevity.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of the
famous spiritual practices

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
out there like Taoism
or TCM or Ayurveda

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
were very focused on
extending human lifespan.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So there is no biohacking
without acknowledging

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
What you find is that
when you deliberately

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
build a body and a
mind that is resilient,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that has more energy than
it ever did before, that has

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
more than enough
energy to just survive,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
you will naturally
and inexorably

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
be pulled into a
spiritual direction.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because when there's
enough energy for that,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
that's what the
body's designed to do.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
What this episode is about
is about teaching you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
how to create automatic
kindness and forgiveness,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
because those are states
that are beneficial for you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
biologically and
neurologically and emotionally

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's hard to do that.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Many different practices around
the world will lead you there.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of the
practices you'll find on Gaia

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
help to create these states.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But as a biohacker, I'm
interested in getting there.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also interested
in getting there

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
in the fastest possible time,
with the least possible effort.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can save
that time and that effort

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and I can apply that
somewhere else, whether it's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
in service to other people, to
my family, or just doing stuff

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that brings me joy,
why would I do anything

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's harder
than is necessary

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:90%
in order to get those results?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And around my
spiritual practice,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I believe the same thing.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
As you build
physical resilience,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
as your body becomes
better able to sense

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
the environment around you,
your spiritual resilience

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:90%
grows as well.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:10%
In the model that
I use, you have

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:10%
mitochondria, billions of them
embedded inside your cells.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
way more of them

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
than there are
cells in your body.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria serve as antennas
for the world around you.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:90%
They're environmental sensors.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
They're tiny little
computers that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:90%
try to make sense of reality.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Then they are a collective
consciousness inside your body

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that decides whether
to make energy,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
whether to make stress
hormones or sex hormones,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
or to fold proteins
or to make melatonin.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It can manufacture anything.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Whether just to make a ton
of electricity for you.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it filters out
a bunch of information

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and sends the rest of
it up into neurons,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
which eventually
makes it to your brain

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
a third of a second later.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So your mitochondria are your
frontline spiritual sensors.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
If you can use
spiritual practice

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to program your
mitochondrial networks

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to find the reality
that you want,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:90%
they will help you do that.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you leave them
up to their own devices,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
they will find things
that are fearful.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
They will find lack.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
They will find anger.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
They will find hate because
they think it makes you safer.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's your job to
program your mitochondria

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to behave themselves in order
to create the world that you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
want to live in.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.167 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there is science
showing that mitochondria

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and other parts of
your nervous system

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
are filtering out reality so
that you can just see enough.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you had a life size
map of the state of California.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You just unroll it and
then you could use it,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
except it would be useless.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a tiny map that's
maybe on your phone that

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
represents the state
but it's not the state.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Bad news for you.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you see and
feel and sense right now

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is actually a map of reality
because your brain and my brain

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
are nowhere near big enough
to pick up all of reality.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We just can't process
that much information.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies, as we're
born, as we evolve,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
they filter out
almost everything

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
so that we can pay attention
to a tiny little drop.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:90%
You can control the filter.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what spiritual
practice does for you.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come by this
knowledge intentionally.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I came by this knowledge
because I grew up

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
in a science minded family.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Both of my grandparents were
PhD level nuclear engineers

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
and chemists.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up without a
religious or spiritual

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I grew up
believing that anyone

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
who believed in a spiritual
practice was provably an idiot.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It was only after I
tried all the things that

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to work, and
I was profoundly unhappy.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I was anxious.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.342 align:middle line:84%
And I did all the things that
were supposed to bring you joy.

00:05:50.342 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't work.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered when
I started going deep

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
in personal development
and spiritual practice

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
about 20 years
ago is that trauma

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is the primary programmer
of your mitochondria

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
and of your nervous system.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It affects long-term operations
of that nervous system.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It affects the balance between
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Trauma gets stored
in your body, I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:84%
believe in those mitochondrial
networks, in your fascia.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And unprocessed emotion
that you've held on to gets

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
stored there, and it affects
your lens on reality.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is why emotional
healing is part of biohacking,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
because if you can be triggered
by anything on the planet,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.435 align:middle line:84%
it means you're walking
around with a loaded gun.

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:90%
You think about that.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what triggered means.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
When you do your
spiritual work, when

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
you do your biohacking
work, you unload the gun.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot be triggered.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, what unloads your bullets?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's forgiveness so what
I'm going to do here

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to teach you how
to turn off these bad pattern

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
matches where your mitochondria
are looking around.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to keep you safe.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're triggering you
to feel an anxiety response

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
from something.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, it's just
an inappropriate connection

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
between something
happening around you

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and an emotional response
that's not serving you anymore.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So a spiritual practice
allows you to go in and edit

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:90%
your operating system settings.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
These are non-ordinary
states of consciousness.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And they can look very
different for each of us.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You can have entities
you work with.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You can have non-entities
you work with.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You can have all sorts
of pictures or views

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:90%
of the reality.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, what you can do

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is you can go in and sense
different parts of the world

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
by using a variety of
spiritual practices.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I know beyond a
reasonable doubt because I

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
have worked with world
class gurus you've heard of.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I help them
with biohacking,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual practice,
their meditation practice,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
their ability to
perceive things radically

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
improves, because
their mitochondria

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
that drive that improve.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So biohacking gives you
stronger mitochondria,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
which gives you better antennas
for the spiritual reality

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
bathed in every day.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So do the foundational
hacks that you'll

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
find in the other
episodes of this series.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to eat so
you have clarity.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:10%
Make sure you get your
broad spectrum minerals,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:10%
your vitamin D.A.K.E.
Learn how to exercise

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:10%
in ways that give you
more energy instead

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of sapping your energy.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And magically, your
clarity goes up.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And along the way as
you become more powerful

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
or just as things
happen in your world,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not uncommon for
people to have what's

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:90%
called a spiritual crisis.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
an emotional crisis,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it happens
at the same time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you lost your
house in a flood,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:90%
which has happened to me.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you went
through a bad breakup

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
or you fell in love with a
narcissist or a narcissist

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
destroyed a company
that you worked at

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you have to
do something different.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
can cause you

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to question your
reality, which is

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.752 align:middle line:84%
different than an
emotional crisis.

00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
If you have this kind
of spiritual stress

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
where you really feel like
the world is not right,

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you can operate from a
place of disorientation,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:90%
from weakness, from confusion.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And what you want
to be able to do

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is learn how to handle
spiritual stress.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are
techniques to do that.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If you think spiritual
stress sounds

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
sort of like an airy fairy
conceptual concept, no.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
People who are experiencing
this have physical and emotional

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
responses.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.227 align:middle line:90%
You get mad at people.

00:09:32.227 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You get rashes, pains,
fatigue, a lot of brain fog.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So here's what
you do about this.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to
learn automatic kindness

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And your body will automatically
default to behaviors that

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:90%
are meant to keep you safe.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And this basically
makes you mean.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you selfish.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems that we
have in the world right now

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:90%
is empathy.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:90%
What, Dave?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Did you just say that
empathy is a problem?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Empathy is the first step on
building a spiritual practice,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
because the ability to feel
another person's emotions,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
positive or negative,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.043 align:middle line:84%
that's very, very
important for you.

00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
feel that, you're

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:84%
not going to be a
very nice person.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But once you feel empathy, if
you feel everyone's pain all

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:84%
the time, you will be
disabled by your empathy.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is a major
problem today.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.022 align:middle line:84%
So what you do when you
create automatic kindness,

00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm about to tell
you how to do that,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
is you learn to
wish well for others

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
without having to
take on their pain.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And that is called compassion.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And compassion is a
higher spiritual state

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
than just empathy.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:90%
So they're both good.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.255 align:middle line:90%
But compassion is a lot better.

00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can see
someone suffering.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
You can decide to help them
if it's within your means.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not
yours to handle, you

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
don't have to suffer for the
rest of the day on behalf

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:90%
of someone else.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I've just
mentioned forgiveness.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us, including
me, have been

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:90%
through substantial traumas.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:10%
Forgiveness is a specific
neurological, spiritual state

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:10%
that I've taught 1,500
entrepreneurs and actors

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:10%
and pro-athletes how to do using
neurofeedback and neuroscience.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is not saying that
something that happened to you

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
is OK.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:10%
It is not saying that something
bad that happened was OK

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:10%
or telling the person who did
it to you that you forgive them.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is about you
turning off an automatic fear

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety response
to something.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:10%
It means letting go of a
grudge so that it no longer can

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:10%
trigger you.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:10%
So you can be non-reactive.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:10%
When you forgive, which is part
of the reset process that's

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:10%
in my books and in
my content online

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:10%
at my neuroscience company,
it's a structured process.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And it permanently removes
automated unkindness.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this in
people's brainwave patterns.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Think about it like this you're
driving in traffic and someone

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
cuts you off.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the normal
response that I've

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
had for the first
half of my life

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.192 align:middle line:84%
involved having very built up
muscles around my middle finger

00:12:12.192 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
because I probably would
have flipped the person off,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I would have got mad.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And my body would have
automatically created

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.098 align:middle line:84%
a story that this
person cut me off

00:12:20.098 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
because they think they're
more important than me

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter
and how unjust it is

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of whatever.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not a
very healthy response

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
because it didn't make me happy.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It made me unhappy.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't change the fact
the person was in front of me.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So an equally valid
story is that the person

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
is on the way to the hospital
for the birth of their child

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
or to see their mom
before she passes away.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.100 align:middle line:84%
What's going on here is I get
to choose my state because I'm

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
no longer triggered by someone
cutting me off because I

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:90%
changed the story around it.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the way you activate
this forgiveness and the way

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
you do what I call a spiritual
reset is you actually seek out

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
a triggering memory.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
What's the first time you felt
the way that you feel when you

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:84%
get triggered by
something, something

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
you just really have
a hard time handling.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you just sit with
that and you feel into it,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see a
picture in your head.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Something's going to appear.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It's usually something
from childhood

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't make
any sense sometimes.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you'll say,
Oh, that is the first time.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I forgot about
that all the time.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, Oh, that's weird.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
My nervous system as a
40 something year old

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
is still running
programming from first grade

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
that I had forgotten all about.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:90%
None of this is conscious.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
This is all in your
operating system.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And a spiritual practice
around forgiveness

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
allows you to go in
and find those states.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And you actually re-experience
the pain as best you can.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to be able
to do is then literally sit

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%
the person across from you.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You visualize them across from
you with your eyes closed.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And you see it from
their perspective.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And you ask yourself, what
did that person's parents

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:90%
do to them?

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:84%
What had to happen
to that person

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to make them do whatever
it was they did?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Like how bad is their life?

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you see it from
their point of view?

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is
that if you look

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
at it from their point
of view, they probably

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't even what they
were doing or maybe they

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
knew what they
were doing but they

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.410 align:middle line:84%
did that because their
operating system was programmed

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
by all kinds of abuse and
other things like that.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So what you realize is that
it wasn't about you at all.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
forgive the other person

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
once you see it from
their perspective.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is
you felt the pain,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
you allowed yourself,
Oh, God that really hurt.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You've seen it from
their point of view.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you
actually do your best

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to generate a sense of
feeling of forgiveness

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that actually comes from your
heart to the other person.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:10%
And when you're feeling
that acceptance,

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:10%
you want to turn on the most
blissful state you can imagine.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:10%
And this is a state where you
feel your heart physically

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:10%
open, your eyes are
closed, your attention

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:10%
is on your third
eye, which puts you

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:10%
into a specific brain state
that makes it easier to forgive.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And you sit there and
then you bring a feeling

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.532 align:middle line:84%
in the hairs on your body,
in your thighs, in your hips,

00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, in your neck,
in your arms, your whole body.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:90%
A feeling of glowing.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
A feeling of happiness.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:90%
A feeling of gratitude.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when your body
feels the painful state

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and the blissful
state, it realizes

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:90%
that it was making a mistake.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And it brings the two together.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
But here's the magic.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
During this process, you
have to find something

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:90%
that you're grateful for.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have worked through this
with people who are actually

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
tortured when they come to
my neuroscience clinic in war

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
combat veterans.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with people
who had incredible losses

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.407 align:middle line:84%
And the hardest thing is to sit
there and say you just talked

00:15:52.407 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
about all the bad
stuff that happened.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Name one good thing
that came out of that.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be a big thing.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It can be I'm thankful
I still have my legs.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
One good thing, because the way
your operating system is set up

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
is you cannot forgive anyone or
anything until you experience

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:90%
gratitude.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is the thing that
allows you to do forgiveness.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.932 align:middle line:10%
So you sit there, you feel the
pain, you look for gratitude.

00:16:18.932 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:10%
You look at it from the
other person's point of view.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:10%
And then you consciously turn
on the best feeling you've ever

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:10%
had, the feeling of bliss.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:10%
And the bliss will
cancel that out.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:10%
I like to do this with
neurofeedback because I can

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:10%
guide you into those states.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But what you're learning here
is a shortcut to something

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that would be called
loving kindness meditation.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
allows you to selectively go

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
through and edit out the things
that are your biggest triggers,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
so that someone
can say something

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to you that would normally make
you just clench up and maybe

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
yell at them and act
like a crazy person

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:90%
and you regret it later.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:90%
You can turn all that off.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So the next time they do it,
you can just look at them

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and just look at them.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.328 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a
negative feeling.

00:16:59.328 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:90%
There's not a positive feeling.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:90%
There's just no charge at all.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I've spent six months of
my life with electrodes

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
glued to my head learning
how to do this practice

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and doing it over and over
on every single trigger

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I can find in my life.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you meet me and you
can find a way to trigger me,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.473 align:middle line:84%
I will thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

00:17:16.473 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that
is that I will go in

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.432 align:middle line:84%
and I will do this reset
process that I just taught you

00:17:20.432 --> 00:17:21.997 align:middle line:84%
and then it won't
bother me anymore.

00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:10%
So you can live
your life that way,

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:10%
where every time
something happens,

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:10%
you have automatic kindness.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You wish well for
others no matter

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
what they do to you because
you can teach your mitochondria

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Before your mitochondria
has a chance

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to automatically think negative
things and look for threats

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and look for bad things.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
If you look for threats and
bad things, you will find them.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
If you look for good
things, you will find them.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get
to do the looking.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You get to configure the
system that does the looking.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
practice gratitude.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
practice forgiveness.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
This works whether you
have a religious practice,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
whether you have a
spiritual practice

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:90%
from any lineage on the planet.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:10%
You can practice forgiveness.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I have done this with
advanced monks, with gurus,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've done it with
football players.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:84%
This forgiveness state
is part of being human.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.563 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way you
program your networks

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:17.855 align:middle line:90%
to do what you want them to do.

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Now that you understand
this process,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand
there are spiritual hacks.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do a spiritual
practice all by yourself.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's much harder
to do it by yourself.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that has
worked for thousands of years

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:90%
is you find a guru.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's lots
of them here on Gaia.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And latching yourself to a
single guru has some benefits.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It also has some risks because,
well, gurus tend to die.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
get into a state

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
without your guru,
when your guru dies,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a spiritual crisis.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And you don't want to do that.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
So learn from a guru.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
there's benefits

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to learning from multiple
practices at the same time.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And just please practice
gratitude and forgiveness

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
no matter who you're
studying with.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It will help you
in your practice.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:10%
And there are some things
that will very rapidly put you

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:10%
in advanced non-ordinary
states of consciousness.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ones
that's very powerful

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:10%
is holotropic breathing.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I did this first 20 years ago
with Stan Grof, the guy who

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:90%
invented holotropic breathing.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've hosted breathwork
sessions for my community

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Holotropic breathing
is something

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that Stan and his wife
invented many years

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
ago because Stan used
legally LSD in his practice

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:90%
in Czechoslovakia.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
When LSD became
illegal, he found a way

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.772 align:middle line:84%
to enter the same states using
a yogic breathing technique.

00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's taught hundreds
of thousands of people

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
He's considered to be the father
of transpersonal psychology.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way
to access this.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.247 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
you about four hours.

00:19:57.247 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
You do it with a
partner or a therapist

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or a group of people as best and
special breathing techniques.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can access very, very
altered spiritual states.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't take a lifetime.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It takes four hours.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You can also learn how to
practice really, really

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
good spiritual sex as
a spiritual practice.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Things like Taoism,
things like tantric sex,

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
or even things
conscious BDSM are ways

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to access the somatic body.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The feelings in the
body, because when

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
you go into the
body, that's when you

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:90%
can go into a spiritual state.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Working with a partner
to go into your body

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is a way to do that,
that is very, very

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:90%
valuable for some people.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
There's another
technique or technology

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
called EMDR, eye
movement desensitization

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and reprocessing.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Just remember EMDR.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:10%
EMDR is a spiritual
reset mode where

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:10%
you go in with a therapist,
they have move your eyes back

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and forth in a very
specific pattern,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:10%
and then all of a
sudden, whatever

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:10%
you're working on, whatever that
trigger was it'll just pop up.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
this unusual state,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
you can just let it go
similar to the gratitude

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness process
I just taught you.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.473 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, sometimes it

00:21:08.473 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
just takes one or two
sessions to get over something

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:90%
that you're really stuck on.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it takes a year to
clear out a lot of your trauma.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:10%
You can also, as a
spiritual hack a way

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:10%
to get there more quickly, you
can use psychedelic therapy.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:10%
And these have
biological and there are

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.555 align:middle line:10%
very definite spiritual risks.

00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to use psychedelics,

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
do them with an exceptionally
experienced shaman or therapist

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:90%
who's licensed for that.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And start with the light ones.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go do
ayahuasca right away.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is that if you

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
don't have the right people
holding space for you,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that some
of these things

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
have a downside that's
greater than the upside.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:10%
So just be careful.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:10%
Don't rely on psychedelics.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have to do
ayahuasca 100 plus times

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and you talk about it
incessantly on your podcast,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
you probably didn't
get the message

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that it didn't work
after the fifth time.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
open a doorway for you

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:90%
so that you can do the work.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you rely on
psychedelics to do the work,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
they are not a
spiritual technology.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
They're actually a spiritual
bypassing technology.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
This is rampant in
the world today.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're an important tool.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Follow properly trained
people, not podcasters.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.493 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one of the most
impactful spiritual hacks

00:22:28.493 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that I've come across
in my life, the reason I

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
started a company that does
this is EEG or neurofeedback.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
You can see the patterns
of trauma and PTSD

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in someone's brainwaves,
even if they don't tell you

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:90%
they have trauma.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I do then is I train
the brain out of that pattern.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of
simultaneously doing EEG,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
so you can see what
your brain's doing

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and a personal
development practice

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:84%
allows you to examine everything
in your life, including trauma.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:10%
And it lets you choose
the state you're in

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:10%
based on what the EEG is doing.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about just hooking
your brain up and trying

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
something, it's about
hooking your brain up

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
while I teach you
the reset process

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about earlier.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see
how your brain changes.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can correlate, oh,
when my body feels like this,

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:90%
my brain is doing that.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Now I know how to do it.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
That now I know how to do
it could have taken you

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
10 years of daily meditation
practice to master.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is such an
amazing spiritual technology

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
if you have the right
personal development

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
process and the right
neurofeedback equipment.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
You can edit the
invisible patterns

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that you use to
interact with the world.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:90%
And I mentioned gratitude.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is a part
of doing forgiveness.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But gratitude itself is
a way to turn off fear.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to tell
you a little story.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
When I did my first personal
development event many,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, I was
feeling really uncomfortable.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And the very, very
wise woman who

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
was running this event
she said, well, you're

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:90%
not feeling your feelings.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
feeling my feelings.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm angry.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.357 align:middle line:90%
This is really stupid.

00:24:07.357 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I signed up
for this dumb event anyway.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I said that.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:90%
I was a jerk.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me
and she said, well,

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
do you feel anything
in your body?

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said Yes.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I feel something in my stomach.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's
a name for that.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is it?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And she said, it's fear.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I looked her right in
the eyes and I said Barbara,

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason
for me to be afraid,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:90%
therefore I'm not afraid.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And she laughed and she
said, fear is an emotion,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to be rational.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And those are really
important words for you,

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:84%
because if you think you're
a rational being, it's wrong.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You are an emotional
and a rational being

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And your body has the ability
to change what you see

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and to change the emotional
tune of what you see

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and then you act rationally
based on bad information

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:90%
from your operating system.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you turn on gratitude,
it takes your body out

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of fight or flight mode,
out of find problems

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:90%
in the world mode.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:10%
And it turns off fear even if
you don't think you have fear.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Fear can be hidden.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So a practice of
gratitude makes your life

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:90%
feel like it takes less work.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning, you can
write down three things

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%
you're grateful for.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And that will prime your brain
to look for more good things

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
At night, you can write
down three good things

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:90%
that happened to you that day.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go to
sleep without fear.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll go to bed more easily.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:90%
You can do a gratitude walk.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
You go for a walk and just pay
close attention to everything

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
you see and you can be
grateful for the flower.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You can be grateful
for the clouds.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even matter.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
turn on gratitude

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's something you can
practice like a muscle.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly, U.J. Ramdas
who's a behavioral change

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:10%
specialist figured out that you
need to experience gratitude

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:10%
in your mind cognitively
and physiologically

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.792 align:middle line:10%
for it to be effective.

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you can't
think about being grateful.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel grateful
and think grateful.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn to turn on any
feeling in your body you want.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Turning on gratitude
is the most valuable

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
because you need it to
turn on forgiveness,

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:90%
which is also valuable.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And get this, a
gratitude exercise

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:84%
as part of your
spiritual practice

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:84%
can boost mitochondrial
enzymes that

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
make you happier, more positive,
and more emotionally open.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And it takes two weeks of
gratitude practice to do that.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you
have my gratitude

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
for spending the last
half hour with me.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is Biohacking.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
