[CHEERING]

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Biohacking, it's not
just about being well,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:90%
it's about being more than well.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave Asprey, and
this is "Biohacking."

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
When I started the Biohacking
movement, a big part of it

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
was supplements,
because supplements

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
can give you direct control
over your own biology.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
They can make you feel normal,
and they can give you abilities

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't otherwise have
without specific supplements.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'm
going to teach you

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
about supplements that can
increase your lifespan,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
as well as baseline supplements
that we all need to improve

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:90%
your metabolic processes.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind
of two categories.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
One is I want everything to work
the way it's supposed to work,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
another one which

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
is I want things to work better
than they're supposed to work.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.163 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do my best
to tell you, look,

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
this is what everyone needs just
to function in the world today.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.038 align:middle line:84%
And if you want this
superpower, try this supplement.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:84%
We still have this
idea that we're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
supposed to get our
nutrients only from our diet,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
even though the
stresses in our lives

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.738 align:middle line:84%
and the toxins in our lives are
not coming from mother nature.

00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:10%
So if you have that
belief, it's time

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:10%
to set it aside because
it doesn't make any sense.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:10%
Why would you only get
nutrients from food?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:10%
You don't even know what
nutrients are in your food.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.117 align:middle line:84%
Your modern lifestyle--
you're indoors,

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:90%
so you don't get sunlight.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
You're surrounded
by synthetic toxins.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
categories of nutrients

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that are baseline for
everyone and most of us

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough, and
they play with each other.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:10%
One of them is called broad
spectrum minerals or what I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:10%
call minerals 101
and vitamin D.A.K.E.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
That's vitamin D-A-K-E.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And just about everyone
needs to be taking these.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:10%
The reason is that the fat
soluble vitamins in vitamin

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:10%
D.A.K.E, they drive
minerals into your cells,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:10%
into your bones so that the
minerals know where to go.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:10%
For your exercise to work,
for your meditation to work,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:10%
for you to get a
response for your efforts

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:10%
to improve yourself, you
have to have vitamin D.A.K.E

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:10%
and minerals so the
raw materials are there

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:10%
for self-transformation.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter what age you
are, you just need these,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're not in
our food anymore.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Some people will say, why don't
I just take a one pill a day

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:10%
multivitamin?

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:10%
It says, I only need one a day.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's a problem there.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Those supplements are
almost always low quality.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:10%
They don't provide good forms
of vitamins and minerals.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:10%
The ratios are off, and
it is impossible to fit

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:10%
the right amount of
the basic minerals,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:10%
much less all the other
vitamins in a single pill.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So someone selling you a bill
of goods and a single one

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
pill a day multivitamin just
isn't going to do much for you.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.814 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Minerals are the least
sexy of all the supplements

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:90%
you could take.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.722 align:middle line:10%
I want to talk to you
about the supplements

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:10%
that increase libido
and make you live longer

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:10%
and improve your vision or make
you sleep better, but honestly,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:10%
don't waste your money
on those if you're not

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:10%
taking a broad spectrum
multi-mineral formula

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:10%
and your vitamin
D.A.K.E. And your body

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:10%
will allocate minerals
throughout your tissues

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:10%
to build components of your
cells, especially enzymes.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
For your body to
be alive, you have

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
to make enzymes that allow
biochemical processes to happen

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
without a lot of heat.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So all biochemistry
depends on the enzymes,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and they depend
on trace minerals.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that's happening now

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
is, well, we've been tilling our
soil for more than 100 years--

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:90%
that's plowing.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
We've used industrial
fertilizers for a long time,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and now we've put
glyphosate on the soil.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things, in combination,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
mean that the soil
has lost its minerals.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, well,
I'm eating some spinach.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Spinach has iron.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I know I saw it on that old
cartoon called "Popeye."

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality is that
your spinach may or may not

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
have iron depending on
what was in the soil.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And even if the spinach
has iron, it's only 1.7%

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.073 align:middle line:84%
absorbable because
leafy greens are

00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
terrible source of minerals
because the minerals are

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
all bound up.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on there?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.848 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
every plant you eat,

00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't know how many
minerals are in it?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But you can bet that
it's less than you think

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because our soil
has been mistreated

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and plants have been mistreated.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Another thing has
happened in the world--

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
we've seen big food
companies trying

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to market subsistence
level survival

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
foods like oats and grains and
whole grains and whole seeds

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:90%
as superfoods.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And they contain high levels of
something called phytic acid.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
When you eat these foods that
are marketed as health foods--

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
even things like corn flakes
and puffed rice are very high

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
in phytic acid--

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
they suck minerals out of
your bones and your cells.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:10%
This is how plants
protect themselves.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So our diet is higher in phytic
acid than it was 100 years ago.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Our plants and even our
animals are lower in minerals

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
than they were 100 years ago.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder there's an
epidemic of low minerals.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So they're the least
interesting of the supplements,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're the
most broad spectrum

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
foundational supportive things.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So vitamin D.A.K.E and
broad spectrum minerals.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:90%
That is foundational.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Start there before
you do anything else.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.338 align:middle line:84%
And if you're curious
about what I just

00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
said about plants--
what do you mean,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.255 align:middle line:84%
plants might not
be good for you?

00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Plants can be good and not
good for you at the same time.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I was-- in my journey of
developing a diet where people

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
have lost millions of pounds
and losing 100 pounds myself,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I was a devout raw vegan.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So I sprouted, I
blended, I soaked--

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff you do--
giant salad bowls.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
balanced vegan diet.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting
cold all the time.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:10%
I developed autoimmune issues.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:10%
I got joint pain that
took years to get rid of,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.505 align:middle line:10%
and I cracked teeth.

00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They got temperature
sensitive and then

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
they just started breaking
because my vegan diet was

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:84%
sucking minerals
out of my bones,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
out of my teeth
and my joint pain.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
All of that was
fixed with minerals

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and saturated fats that
you can't get from plants.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
As things stand today,
about a year ago, I

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
had to have a yoga injury
surgically repaired

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and it required cutting
through the bone in my foot.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm a
biohacker, I was awake

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:10%
and I talked to the
surgeon during the surgery

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:10%
even I couldn't feel it.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
And I heard the bone saw start.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It goes bzzz.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets to the
bone and it goes vrooo

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and it almost stopped.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor
looked at the nurse

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:90%
and he said, what is going on?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a hard time
getting through the bone.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:10%
Is this guy even human?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And after the surgery, he
said, Dave, before you,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I operated on
someone half your age

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and the saw cut through
their bones like butter.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
What are you possibly doing?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:10%
Bone density is a sign
of metabolic health

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:10%
and bone density is a sign
of getting enough minerals

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:10%
into your body.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:10%
I practice what I preach, so
I've been taking minerals 101,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:10%
like the broad spectrum
mineral type of supplements.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been taking
vitamin D.A.K.E for years,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:84%
as well as the other things
you learn in these episodes,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
including the types
of exercise and all.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can have bones
that are really strong.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that weak bones
because you don't have minerals

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
are a major source of
death for people over 50.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You fall down, you break a
hip, and you die within a year.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it so that
you don't fall down,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and if you do fall
down, you have

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
bones that don't break because
you have enough minerals.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You also have more energy
and a better working brain

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and better sleep and better
sex, and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm so into vitamin
D.A.K.E and the big minerals.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's more than
just big minerals,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
there's three kinds of minerals
you want to pay attention to.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
There's the big ones
that we've all heard of,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
then there's trace minerals,
which you need small amounts.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
ultratrace minerals

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.442 align:middle line:84%
that are present in
the Earth's crust

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that your body uses
teeny tiny amounts of.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You're probably
missing all of those.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about a broad
spectrum mineral thing,

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I just mean the big minerals.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
These are, calcium,
magnesium, sodium, potassium,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and phosphorus.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Calcium-- you need about
1,000 milligrams per day,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're probably
getting enough

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:84%
if you eat any dairy products
or if you eat bone broth.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
If you are a vegan or after you
watch this series of episodes,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
a former vegan like
me, you may decide

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.282 align:middle line:84%
that you include some dairy
or some meat products,

00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably
get enough calcium.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's a form
of calcium called

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
calcium fructoborate
that radically

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:90%
promotes bone density.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.258 align:middle line:90%
It's a super power calcium.

00:09:05.258 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the big
reasons my bones are dense.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
That plus broad
spectrum minerals.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
There's also something called
calcium D-glucarate, which

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
is another form of
calcium that gives you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:90%
extra liver detoxing abilities.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So those two calciums
are preferred ways

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to get calcium because they
give you extra powers with it.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But most of us,
even though we have

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
enough calcium from
the foods that we eat,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:90%
don't get enough magnesium.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium is a cofactor
in more than in 300

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:90%
enzymatic processes.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
When you have enough magnesium
that your body can use,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
it helps to control
glucose, blood pressure,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
even helps with
sleep and stress.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But there are about a
dozen forms of calcium,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and they don't all
work very well.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Any form of calcium that
ends in "ate," an A-T-E

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a form you
want, like citrate or glycenate

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
or the form that I like the best
is called magnesium threonate.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And that can cross the
blood brain barrier,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and you want somewhere between
500 and 1,000 milligrams

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
per day.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And you may need
to split the doses

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because your body
naturally wants

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.672 align:middle line:90%
the most magnesium at noon.

00:10:14.672 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you take some in the
morning and some at night,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:90%
that works best.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You can go higher
than 1,000 milligrams.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
If you take too much magnesium,
you can expect disaster pants.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Then there's sodium.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
what do you mean?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I thought sodium was bad.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Minerals are not good or bad.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They're just useful, and you
can have too much or too little.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have an epidemic of too
little sodium in people today.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You may hear that and say,
but I just saw an ad on TV

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
from a big food company telling
me that they had a low sodium

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:90%
product.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, big companies are
oftentimes stuck in the 1970s.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
We know now that the more
stress you are under,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
the more your body needs sodium.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But we're almost all
potassium deficient.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So if you take more sodium--

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I take about 8 grams a day,
almost four times the RDA,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
which absolutely
improves my life.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're on a low carb
diet or you exercise a lot

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
or you sweat a lot,
you need more sodium.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.955 align:middle line:84%
But I also take
potassium because you

00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
want to have a balance
between the two.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Most people who think that
salt causes high blood pressure

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
are just deficient in
potassium and magnesium.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
To add sodium to your diet,
especially in the morning,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
use high quality desert salt
or microplastic-free sea salt.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can put it in water, you
can sprinkle it on your food.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
If your taste buds want
more salt, there's a reason,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
and you should give it to them.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You also might want to
consider increasing potassium,

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
another one of
the macrominerals.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It works well with sodium to
keep body fluids in balance

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
and even to make nerve impulses.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
A good target is about 5,000
milligrams per day from food

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and supplements like potassium
citrate, potassium aspartate,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:90%
or potassium bicarbonate.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is important-- do
not take all your potassium

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You spread it out and
always take it with meals.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take a lot
of potassium without sodium,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it can cause fluctuations
in your heart rate.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why most potassium
pills are very, very small,

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:90%
like, 100 milligrams small.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So you would need
many of those pills.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Most people take
potassium in a powder form

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:90%
in order to get enough.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:10%
Just don't take it all at
once, take it with food.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
After those big minerals,
we get into trace minerals,

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and these are things
that are almost

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
universally deficient, but
not always in the same way

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:90%
in every person.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Things like copper, which is
toxic if you have too much.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
enough, you'll have anemia.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Things like zinc, iodine,
which controls your thyroid.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:10%
Iron, which is toxic
in higher doses.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:10%
Manganese, which is toxic in
higher doses, but so necessary.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Things like
molybdenum, selenium.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
These trace minerals can provide
profound benefits for you.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And since you're
almost certainly

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:84%
in balance on some of
these, taking more of them

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
in a balanced formula
is a really good idea.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like this idea
of broad spectrum of minerals

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
101 formulas that have
all the minerals that you

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:90%
would want in them.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
As an example,
copper protects you

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
against allergies and
histamine intolerance.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:10%
Copper controls sex drive, brain
function, hair, bone health,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:10%
but you only need 1 to
3 milligrams per day.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people,
during the pandemic,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
started supplementing with
insane amounts of zinc.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:84%
If you take too much
zinc, it can actually

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:90%
suppress your copper levels.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:10%
So if your hair turned
gray during the pandemic,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:10%
stress might have played
a role, but it could

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:10%
have been problems with zinc.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Speaking of zinc, what
does zinc do for you?

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, it controls your blood
sugar, your blood pressure,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:10%
immunity, and some hormones,
especially the sex hormones.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people these days
are getting too much

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:90%
because of supplements.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't supplement
with anything that has zinc,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
you could be deficient.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The two forms of zinc
that are most interesting

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
are zinc orotate
and zinc carnosine.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:84%
You might also
consider zinc niacin.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:10%
Take about two to three
times as much zinc

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:10%
as copper up to about
15 milligrams per day

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:10%
and take your zinc and copper
far apart from each other.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:10%
If you can, if they're
all in a single formula,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:10%
it's still good to take it.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.572 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:27.572 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Iodine is absolutely necessary
for thyroid function and many

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of us are low in iodine,
especially if you're

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
using the higher quality sea
salts that don't include iodine

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
like industrial salt.
The recommended allowance

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
from the government
is 150 micrograms,

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
but the government
allowances are the minimum

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
necessary to prevent
you from getting

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:90%
a disease of insufficiency.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that
it's the level that gives you

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:90%
full power as a human being.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm not even sure
they want you to have that.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
But I want you to have that.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I like to take about
500 micrograms up

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to 1 milligram per day
from kelp powder or just

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:90%
straight potassium iodide.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:10%
And if you have kids who
don't like taking supplements,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:10%
you can actually paint
a little smiley face

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:10%
on their arm in iodine.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It'll absorb right in.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Iron is absolutely
essential to make energy.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
too much iron, it

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:90%
creates reactive oxygen species.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of iron in your
blood can increase cancer risk.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you have anemia,
you might say, well,

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
that means I'm low in iron.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not because your
body can't absorb iron

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:90%
without having copper.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So some people who
have anemia need

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to take copper and iron so
that it starts working again.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
You have more risk of having
too much iron versus not enough,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:90%
unless you know you have anemia.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And then there's manganese.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
This helps to maintain
blood glucose.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It keeps your blood
vessels working.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.815 align:middle line:84%
You need about 2
milligrams per day.

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:10%
You probably aren't
getting enough from food,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:10%
unless you eat a ton of plants
that have it bioavailable,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:10%
which is really hard to do.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend
supplementing it.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Molybdenum is a really
important mineral

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that should be in
your minerals 101

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of everything-in-it
formula,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and there are a
variety of companies

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that make broad spectrum
mineral formulas.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
A deficiency in moly
can change your mood,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
reduce your stress resilience
and interfere with your sleep.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the mineral
that recycles

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
glutathione, which is one of
your biggest detox molecules.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You only need 50
micrograms per day,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and it should be in
your supplements,

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:90%
but it probably isn't.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:90%
There's also selenium.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It increases stress resilience.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It helps your body not
have mercury poisoning.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Your thyroid needs it.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
But too much of it is toxic.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is one where
you might get a blood

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
test for your levels,
but you generally

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
want to take 50 to 200
micrograms of selenium

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
every other day,
or make sure you

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
eat a lot of meat,
eggs, and wild seafood,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:90%
you'll probably get enough.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And to get your
ultratrace minerals,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that's where you want
humic and fulvic complexes

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
from ancient deposits of plants.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I highly recommend
finding those already put

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:90%
into your coffee.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
Now, you probably didn't
know that minerals

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
were that important in
your body, but you do now.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get a
broad spectrum mineral formula,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
but then you've got to have
vitamin D.A.K.E with it.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D.A.K.E is a
specific combination

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin D3, real vitamin
A-- not plant-based vitamin

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
A-- specific types of vitamin K
and a specific form of vitamin

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
E. That combination will
drive all those minerals

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
into the right
places in your body.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So those are your two
foundational non-negotiable

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.507 align:middle line:84%
supplements before you get
into all the cool stuff, which

00:17:42.507 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:90%
is where we're going next.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.596 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
At this point, you're
taking your minerals 101.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You're taking your
vitamin D.A.K.E,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but what about living to
180 because I did talk

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:90%
about that earlier, right?

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the deal.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Today, we can live to 120.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think we might be able to
do 50% better than our current

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
best over the next 100
years because science

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.557 align:middle line:90%
is moving that way.

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I know I interview
all the scientists,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
like, this is really
happening in your lifetime.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that makes you live

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
longest is to have mitochondria
that work really, really well.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Most supplements that enhance
mitochondria also slow aging.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to tell
you the big guns.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
These are not all
cheap, but all of these

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
are shown to be very effective
and giving you more energy now

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and giving you more years
of life later, that's

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:90%
why I take these.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
interesting new supplements

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is called urolithin A. This is
a bacterial byproduct called

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:90%
a postbiotic.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to eat a
pound or two of pomegranate,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and you had the
right gut bacteria,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
you would make
urolithin A in a way

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that would give you way more
mitochondrial energy and better

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
gut.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Problem is most of us don't
eat that much, and if we did,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:90%
we'd have a lot of sugar anyway.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you get urolithin
A as a supplement,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.543 align:middle line:90%
it induces mitophagy.

00:19:09.543 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it makes your body

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
get rid of weak mitochondria.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It slows aging, and it
significantly, in studies,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:90%
increases muscle output.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and in fruit flies, which
is the model we use for aging,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
it only extends lifespan by 50%.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
500 milligrams of
urolithin A every day.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's about six times better
at triggering mitophagy

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
than drinking 8 ounces
of pomegranate juice.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is
you'd have to drink

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
48 ounces of pomegranate
juice and have the right gut

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:84%
bacteria to take one
little capsules worth.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Then there's calcium AKG.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
In mice, which are
remarkably similar to humans,

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
it extends lifespan by 12%.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And in humans, it improves
mitochondrial health.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It also is a form of calcium.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I take it every day.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's got great evidence
for anti-aging.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Then there's spermidine.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I first wrote about spermidine
when you couldn't buy it

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.692 align:middle line:84%
as a supplement, and you had
to take a probiotic to make it,

00:20:09.692 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't one you
could even get in the US.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But the studies are so
strong that spermidine

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
is good for you.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Today, you can get spermidine
in supplement form, in a pill

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:90%
or in a little sachet of powder.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
There's also some
present in chlorella.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it triggers autophagy.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you have
to fast in order

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
for your body to get rid of
zombie cells and old cells

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and to renew and
regenerate itself.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Spermidine makes
your body think it's

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
fasting, even if
you're eating, so you

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%
get the benefits of autophagy.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I take spermidine
every single day

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
because in studies, it can turn
on mitochondrial biogenesis.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So one effect is
get rid of old ones,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:90%
the other one is grow new ones.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.317 align:middle line:90%
It even reverses cardiac aging.

00:20:54.317 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You want a young
heart if you're going

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:90%
to live to 100-plus years.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
A 20-year long study
found that eating

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
more spermidine-rich
foods, correlated

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
with just a five-year
increase in life expectancy,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and it reduces markers of
aging in other animals.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Another powerful supplement
for energy and anti-aging

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:90%
is oxaloacetate.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
This is an intermediate
in your Krebs cycle,

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and you might not remember that
from seventh grade biology.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:90%
I barely do either.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I just wrote a book about it.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So in your cells, either
fat or carbs come in

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a little
cycle, like a little motor,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
you could think of it, that
turns and it makes ATP.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out one of
those intermediate steps,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
the last step before you can
take in new sugar in your cells

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:90%
is oxaloacetate.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:10%
When you take it
as a supplement,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:10%
it makes it easy for your
cells to make ATP very quickly.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:10%
You suck on a lozenge, you feel
it within a couple of minutes.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:10%
It activates brain
mitochondrial biogenesis.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:10%
In other words, more
power in your brain and it

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:10%
activates something
called A.M.P.K,

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
which helps with aging.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:10%
It also scavenges
glutamate, which

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:10%
can be neurotoxic in
the brain, especially

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:10%
if you ate a lot of MSG.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
There's another
anti-aging supplement

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that you might have heard about
if you listened to the detoxing

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:90%
episode.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:90%
It's called activated charcoal.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You can take it during a
fast or before a sauna,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:90%
and it has a huge surface area.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:84%
1 teaspoon has the surface
area about the size of a soccer

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It has a very strong
negative electrical charge.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So it'll draw toxins
out of your body,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:90%
which is why it's anti-aging.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that activated
charcoal extends lifespan

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.715 align:middle line:90%
even if you aren't fasting.

00:22:34.715 --> 00:22:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is something--
you take it away

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
from drugs and supplements,
but it's meaningful.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you could look
at that is commonly available

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is called quercetin,
which promotes

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.835 align:middle line:84%
destruction of senescent or
zombie cells in your body.

00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
These are cells
that aren't dead,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
but they aren't doing
their job either,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.495 align:middle line:84%
so you want to get
rid of those, so you

00:22:52.495 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
can have a better functioning
brain and live a lot longer.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Then there's luteolin.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It supports
autophagy, mitophagy,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.823 align:middle line:84%
and supports cellular
functions that cause your body

00:23:03.823 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
to just get rid of cells
that are overstressed

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and replace them with
young unstressed cells.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are some major
anti-aging compounds.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into some of the
more esoteric or unknown ones.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Then there's fisetin.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
powerful supplement

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that supports autophagy
and causes your body

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
to have fewer of
those zombie cells.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't absorb
that well, so you may need

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
to take a higher dose of it.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Since stress causes aging and
it lowers mental performance,

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
you could look at
the adaptogenic herbs

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
like, rhodiola, ginseng,
holy basil, and ashwagandha.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Those give you more
resilience, which

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:90%
makes you age less quickly.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of a large
list of supplements.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But remember, get a minerals
101 type broad spectrum formula,

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
get your vitamin
D.A.K.E. Start there

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.495 align:middle line:84%
and pick one or two of the list
you just learned about and say,

00:23:55.495 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:84%
you know what, that
sounds interesting.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to try urolithin A.
I want to try spermidine.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Or you might be like
me and say, this

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
thing in my life

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's going to
double my lifespan, at which

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
point, maybe you go in
and do several of them

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to work into it

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's all right, too.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I want you to choose the
result you're looking for

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and take several
supplements at the same time

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
the result. There

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is no point in taking just one
supplement to see if it works.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying, I
wanted to make cookies

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
so I threw just the
chocolate chips in the oven.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And I baked them, I
didn't get cookies,

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:90%
therefore, there's no cookies.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Take all the ingredients
you probably need

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.287 align:middle line:90%
to get the results you want.

00:24:32.287 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It works better that way.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And after that, you can
take away some supplements

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:90%
to see what you don't need.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But doing them
one at a time, you

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
will not live long enough
to try every supplement

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.775 align:middle line:90%
that there is one at a time.

00:24:42.775 --> 00:24:45.880 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing
about supplements is

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
they can interact with
medications if you're

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
on pharmaceuticals,
especially things

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.227 align:middle line:84%
like antidepressants
or blood thinners.

00:24:57.227 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Even vitamin D.A.K.E,
if you're on warfarin,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to take the
K part of vitamin D.A.K.E,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
except you might want to change
your medication so you can have

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
vitamin K2 because you need it.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It's also important that you
go with trustworthy brands.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of brands you
can find on Amazon and places

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:84%
like that, that no one
knows about who they are,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
generally very low
quality, and they

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:90%
can have toxic metals in them.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I generally don't buy
my supplements on Amazon

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
today because there's so much
basically knockoff behavior

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:90%
happening on there.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
You really want to get
something that actually works.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
There are also a
variety of brands who

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:90%
will use vanity ingredients.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.725 align:middle line:84%
So they might tell
you how excited they

00:25:35.725 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
are that they have
some supplement,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
but they put 1% of
what your body needs

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
in it so they can put in big
letters that it's in there.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you
check the label.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:10%
A lot of supplement
manufacturers

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:10%
now have proprietary
blends of the things

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:10%
I just talked about on here.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit of an
issue because if you

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
need to know how much you're
taking and you don't know,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
they ought to be able to tell
you what's in it when you call

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.457 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you want
a different brand.

00:25:58.457 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sure
about a supplement,

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:84%
reach out to the
support of a company

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:90%
and see if they respond.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, who's
running the company?

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Some supplements also contain
artificial ingredients.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:10%
They'll put things like
artificial colors, titanium

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.435 align:middle line:10%
dioxide, artificial flavors.

00:26:13.435 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't need
any of that stuff.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.643 align:middle line:84%
Supplements are supposed
to be good for you.

00:26:16.643 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The form of your
supplements really matters.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
B vitamins don't work for
probably half the population

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:90%
because they're the cheap forms.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
You want to have methylated or
activated forms of B vitamins

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.495 align:middle line:90%
because everyone can use those.

00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
You also want to do a little
bit of research online

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to see if something
is fat soluble or not.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
If it's fat soluble,
it's better with a meal

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
or maybe with coffee
that has butter in it.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Some supplements sit
better on a full stomach.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Fish oil and B vitamins, if you
take those on an empty stomach,

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
you're probably not going
to like what happens.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Also understand, I am 6'
4", 8.6% body fat and a male

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and in an aggressive
anti-aging program.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
If you took my
supplements, but you're

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
100-pound woman
who's 20 years old,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
something bad is
going to happen.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:90%
So don't copy someone.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Understand what your needs
are, understand where you are,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you've learned enough
just in this one episode

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to know you need
your vitamin D.A.K.E,

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
you need your minerals
101, but you probably

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
want to take some of
these other things.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
At least once a year,
I'd love to see you

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
get regular blood work done.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You can get it done at home.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.997 align:middle line:84%
It's become very
affordable online, just

00:27:29.997 --> 00:27:31.622 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you're
on the right track.

00:27:31.622 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Know if your levels
are high or low.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.753 align:middle line:10%
Don't be afraid to
switch things up.

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So you can track how you're
feeling, what's working,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:10%
what isn't.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:10%
And if you just reach
for a bottle of vitamins

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:10%
in the morning and you
just don't feel it,

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:10%
then trust your intuition
and don't take it that day.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good idea to cycle
most of your supplements.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Take them some days, don't
take them other days.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all right.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.835 align:middle line:84%
Except your minerals
and D.A.K.E,

00:27:52.835 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:90%
just take that all the time.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%
That is a ton.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You know the basic
supplements everybody needs,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and you know some super
powered supplements

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that are extending lifespan in
animals and in humans, maybe

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
even you.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
