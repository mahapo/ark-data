00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Biohacking, it's not
just about being well,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:90%
it's about being more than well.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the power to
transform yourself.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is Biohacking.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Dave Asprey.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
And in the process
of losing 100 pounds,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:10%
I had to learn more than I
wanted about the role of toxins

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:10%
in my body and our environment.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And that became a part of the
creation of biohacking itself,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because why would you go to
the trouble of removing toxins

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
from your body when you're
dumping a bunch more in?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could do something
on both sides of that.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode,
I'll teach you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
about the importance of
hacking your environment

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
so you can minimize the
amount of toxins that come in.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you exactly what you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
can do to make it
so your body is

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
better at getting rid of toxins
than mother nature intended.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason this
is so important is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that you get more toxins
from your environment

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
than your ancestors did.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
stuff you eat all by itself

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
probably isn't going to cut it.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.192 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
First thing you
need to understand,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:84%
toxins are everywhere and they
have always been everywhere.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
avoid all of them

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
because your body
works all day long.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It makes toxins in the
process of keeping you alive.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Your gut bacteria
make endotoxins.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:90%
And plants make a ton of toxins.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Spoiled meat is toxic.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Volcanoes have toxic gas.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to
be afraid of toxins.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:10%
But what you want to
understand is which toxins

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:10%
are likely to be
affecting you the most

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:10%
and what can you do to turn up
your body's ability to get rid

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.037 align:middle line:10%
of those toxins,
things you might

00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:10%
want to consider doing
so you can go through

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:10%
focused detox
periods so that you

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:10%
can avoid accelerated aging.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't like the idea

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
of detoxing because they
think somehow it isn't real,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
or they read something about
maple syrup and grapefruit

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:90%
or who the heck knows.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about things that
we know accumulate in your body,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
we know what they do, we know
what level of parts per million

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
affect you, we
know how your body

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to secrete
them and we know

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:90%
why your body isn't doing it.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Since this is real science, this
is the science of biohacking,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to worry
about the latest fad detox.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
This is not a juice cleanse
this is about controlling

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the environment around
you and inside of you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
so you have control
of your own biology.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Toxins can lower your IQ.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:10%
Toxins can make you
die more quickly.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:10%
They are a major cause of brain
fog, of emotional volatility,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:10%
and they mess with
your hormones.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
That crippling energy, times
when you just can't move,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you're so tired, you
want to do something

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
but when you turn on
button for your body,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
you just can't get going,
that's toxins a lot of the time.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And they even damage
your DNA, which

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.773 align:middle line:90%
increases your risk of cancer.

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a marker for aging.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you want to avoid
some or get rid of them

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:90%
if you've already taken them in.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Stop doing the things
that make you weak.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
That's oftentimes
easier than doing

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
things that make you stronger.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So for toxins, avoid the
ones you can easily avoid.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And for the other things, just
upregulate your body's ability

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of it.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
One major cause of toxins that
we just don't hear about very

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:90%
much is toxic mold.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Mold toxins, whether they're
in your food, your coffee,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
or more likely in your home
or school or workplace,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:90%
they cause DNA damage.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
They break down
myelin, that insulating

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
lining of your nerves that
allows electricity to flow

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:90%
through your nervous system.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
They can directly damage
your brain as they did to me.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:10%
And many of them are
known carcinogens.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:10%
They can be found
in your environment

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:10%
and they also can
grow inside your body.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So your sinuses or your GI
tract can have molds or yeast

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
growing that then creates toxins
that your body continuously

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:90%
has to deal with.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I grew up in a
basement that had been flooded

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and not remediated properly.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know that
that was an issue,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
but I had all the
symptoms of mold toxicity.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I would get nosebleeds,
sometimes 5 or 10 times a day.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:10%
I had strep throat
every month for 15 years

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:10%
or a sinus infection
some of the time

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:10%
and took antibiotics for it.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:10%
I had behavioral disorders,
OCD, ODD, Asperger's syndrome

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:10%
and constant rashes, asthma.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:10%
And by the time I
was in my late 20s,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:10%
I was diagnosed with high risk
of stroke and heart attack.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I had hit 300 pounds.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I still have stretch
marks from that.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I had a nice set of
manboobs, and basically I

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:90%
was suffering a lot.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
living under a wet blanket

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and being angry all
the time and tired.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
The thing is about half
of all buildings in the US

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:90%
have a problem with toxic mold.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I know about all this
because I had to heal myself.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:90%
I had to regenerate my brain.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to turn off the
xenoestrogen from toxic molds.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
This is a type of estrogen
made by a fungus that's

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
1,000 times stronger
than human estrogen that

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
was the cause of my low
testosterone in my early 20s.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you
could do, especially

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.983 align:middle line:84%
if something's not
right with your health

00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and you just feel like
it isn't working right,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
or if you can see water
damage on the ceiling,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
you can see mold
anywhere in the house.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
If it just smells funky, you can
test the environment for mold.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
If you have mold
in your house, you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
need to do a couple
of different things.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Either move or get it
professionally remediated.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
I didn't understand

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and so I would
keep my possessions

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from a moldy house that were
very clearly contaminated.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you use the same
pillow and the same mattress

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and the same couch
in your new house,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll have the same
symptoms as your old house.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So once I learned
how to detox it,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:90%
my health is profoundly good.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:10%
And learning about
the role of mold,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:10%
if you just have chronic
problems, including things that

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:10%
go by the names of Lyme disease
or EBV or chronic fatigue

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:10%
syndrome, there is a
common element there

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:10%
and it is toxic mold
in your environment.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And even worse, some foods
contain mycotoxins, especially

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
the plant-based foods.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Grains, the worst ones
are corns and wheat.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Nuts, the worst ones are
Brazil nuts and peanuts.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
When you eat meat and dairy
from cows that eat corn and soy,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
they accumulate the
toxins into their fat.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're getting
non-organic or non-grass fed

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
meat and dairy, you're
likely getting toxins

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:90%
accumulated in that food.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol is almost universally
high in mold toxins,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
and so is coffee and chocolate.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
we have especially

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
in the world of coffee is
that China, Japan, and Europe,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and most of South America
have standards on how much

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:90%
mold toxin is allowed in coffee.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Because coffee is
a fermented product

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
there's always some mold in it.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But problem is that when coffee
is too moldy to sell in most

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of the world, they send it to
the US and then we drink it

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and then an hour later we
get cranky and we want sugar

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and we want more coffee and
we yell at people around us,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
because moldy coffee makes
you feel anxiety in your body.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I quit drinking
coffee for five years

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and today, the
coffee that I make

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is lab-tested and
specially manufactured

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to not have those
levels of mold.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
this can't be real.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.178 align:middle line:90%
No, it is real.

00:07:47.178 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Why else would governments
around the world

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
put these standards in place?

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a 2003 study found
that 91.7% of Brazilian coffee

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
had mold.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:10%
I would just tell you,
if things aren't working

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:10%
in your body, in your
brain, in your life,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:10%
you can't lose
weight it is worth

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:10%
getting yourself tested
for mycotoxins or for mold

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:10%
or getting your
environment tested using

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:10%
a swab test and an air test.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes to heavy
metals, arsenic, cadmium, lead,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and mercury are the
most common heavy metals

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
be bothering you

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:90%
unless you eat a lot of kale.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
In which case, you can
add thallium to the list

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
as well, because kale
accumulates thallium.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
These toxic metals are found in
small amounts but small enough

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to matter in your drinking water
if you still drink tap water.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:90%
If you do, please stop.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
You need to get a
high quality water

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.992 align:middle line:84%
filter if you want
to live a long time

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:90%
and have a brain that works.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Amalgam fillings, if you
still have the silver fillings

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that for 75 years they swore
was safe despite the evidence

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
but now most dentists
have stopped using.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Many of the plant-based protein
powders, especially brown rice

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:10%
protein, pea protein,
they're accumulating

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:10%
large amounts of toxic metals.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Some supplements and
many forms of seafood.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:10%
And I mentioned kale
already but lead

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:10%
is a problem with those
plant-based proteins

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and Brown rice in
particular, whether it's

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:10%
brown rice protein or
just brown rice itself,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:10%
it has 80 times more
arsenic than white rice.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons you
might switch from brown rice

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to white rice, because
white rice and brown rice

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:90%
are both just a source of carbs.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There's negligible vitamins
in the outside of brown rice.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The fiber doesn't matter
because it's coated in arsenic.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly you
make some changes

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and you eat rice
that tastes better,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.555 align:middle line:84%
and now you have less
arsenic exposure.

00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that might
be a good trade off.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're having health
problems or you just

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
want to know where you are,
you can get a test for metals.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:10%
Usually it's a urine test,
but some people do hair tests.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:10%
If you can interpret that
properly, it'll work as well.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
led me down this path

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
is that in my 20s when I was
working on losing the weight

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and getting my brain back,
I did a heavy metal test

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and I had very high levels
of lead and mercury.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I was noticing

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
was that I did advanced
yoga practices back then.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of the harder things
to do is to stand on one leg

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and put your other leg
up like a Tree Pose

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and then close your eyes
because you just tip over.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I found is that if I
ate sushi, later that afternoon

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
if I did yoga, I couldn't
balance very well.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But if I didn't have sushi,
I could balance well.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the subtle
effect of mercury

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:90%
on my nervous system.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But if I took
something that bound

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to the mercury that
was in the sushi, then

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:90%
I could still balance.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I know
it makes a difference.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you're into
meditation and yoga

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
on the subtle
energetics of your body,

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
heavy metals have more
of an effect on you.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you're someone who's
electrically sensitive,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:84%
sometimes that's
because you have

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
too much metal in your
body that kind of makes

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
you act like a big antenna.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So getting rid of those
is really important.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Heavy metals are neurotoxic.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.560 align:middle line:84%
They specifically mess
with your thyroid gland

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
and with your adrenal function.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They can change your insulin
sensitivity, which basically

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
means you'll get diabetes.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
They can suppress
your immune system.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
worst of all, they

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
can inhibit
mitochondrial function.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
When your mitochondria
are at full power,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
your immune system
works and your brain

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
works and you can be happy
and you have willpower

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and you can go do things
that matter in the world.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of
biohacking is around

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
turning your mitochondria up to
their fullest possible energy

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
because when you do that,
who knows what you might do?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
running at half power,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.673 align:middle line:84%
we know what you
might do, just enough

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to get by because
you're just too tired.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where I
was and that's not

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
where I'm ever going to be
again and I want that for you.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
If you still have metal in
your mouth, amalgam fillings,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:84%
you need to go to a dentist
and have them removed safely.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:10%
This is a
dentist-certified in SMART,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:10%
it's called Safe Mercury
Amalgam Removal Technique.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a way of making sure you
don't reabsorb the mercury

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.745 align:middle line:10%
from your metal fillings.

00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
There's another class of toxins
that I'm more worried about now

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
than I was 10 years ago because
it's becoming really apparent

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:10%
It's called
endocrine disruptors.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, toxic mold makes
natural endocrine disruptors

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:10%
but those go away with
sunlight and they break down.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
The man-made
endocrine disruptors

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
are becoming--
there's everywhere.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:10%
Things like household
cleaning products

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:10%
unless you use a very good
brand that is organic-certified

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:10%
and also just non-toxic.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Cosmetics, almost all cosmetics
have endocrine disruptors.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So your testosterone,
your estrogen, they

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:90%
just don't work right.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Lotions and all
the body care stuff

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that you would use, synthetic
fragrances, perfumes.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
These are a problem because
right now, testosterone

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and men and women has dropped
50% in the last 20 years.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
What that means
is that you likely

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
have the same testosterone
levels that your grandparents

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:90%
would have had 20 years ago.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're walking
around saying,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, I just don't
have that much energy.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to do stuff but I
don't have the strong desire.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:90%
I just can't get up.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, testosterone, which is
important for women and men,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it's tied to dopamine, which
is the neurotransmitter

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of happiness, basically,
of getting things done,

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
of motivation.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And testosterone is the
hormone of motivation.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you have xenoestrogens
in that little thing you're

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
hanging in your car to
smell like fabric softener,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that stuff is messing with
your receptors for this.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So your levels drop
and now you don't

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.308 align:middle line:84%
have enough
testosterone, which means

00:13:25.308 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:90%
you don't have enough dopamine.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So you feel kind of
depressed and blah

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and you just can't be
bothered to get up,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
get rid of anything
that smells that's not

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
an actual essential
oil in your house,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and magically you may find
your happiness level goes up

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to be
marinating in xenoestrogens.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
There's also pesticides.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Glyphosate, which is
now something sprayed

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
on non-organic grains in the
US, so when you eat the grains

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
you're getting high
levels of this.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They like to tell you that
it doesn't affect people

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
because it only
affects bacteria.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
By now, I think you understand
that your microbiome

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and your gut is a major
influencer of your metabolism.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're eating wheat that
was sprayed with glyphosate

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the cycle,
right before it was harvested

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to make it ripen more quickly.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you eat it
and then you have

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.777 align:middle line:84%
a major problem in your gut
and you don't feel so good.

00:14:15.777 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then magically if you go to
Europe and you eat wheat there

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.402 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't bother you,
maybe it's the gluten,

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's the poison
that's legal in the US.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:10%
Another form of toxin
that you're exposed to

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:10%
is antibiotics in
industrial animal products.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to say
this straight up.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
If you are vegan, you should
switch to grass-fed animal

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
products because it kills less
animals than vegan agriculture.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat
industrial meat right now

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
or even worse
industrial fake meat,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
you are contributing to
environmental harm but worst

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of all, you're getting the
antibiotics and the bad fats

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
that come in there.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So your job is to figure out how
to demand grass-fed and grass

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.035 align:middle line:84%
finished beef whenever
you go to buy beef.

00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not at the level
where you can afford that,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
eat the leaner cuts
of industrial beef

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
because they have
less toxins in them.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And let's work on
changing the industry

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to grow animals in a way
that supports the soil

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and supports the Earth and
supports human flourishing,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
rather than eliminating
animals so we can

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:90%
have industrial food for all.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:90%
That won't work.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The other major issue,
especially in the US,

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
is monosodium glutamate or MSG.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And MSG excites
neurons in your brain.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat MSG,
which usually isn't labeled

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
in restaurants or even
in packaged foods,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
it goes by secret names
like spice extracts,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
organic spice extracts,
paprika extract,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
textured vegetable protein, and
the list goes on and on and on.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But what MSG does, it triggers
your brain to start firing

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and then it can't stop firing
so you get a sugar craving.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I've run a restaurant in LA for
8 years and I don't do this,

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
but I know because
I see the pitches.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the
catalog of things,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
all restaurants now buy
from the same company.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
It's called Sysco.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
spice mixes you can get

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and it says right
there, "no added MSG,"

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
but there are 74% MSG by
weight because you don't

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:90%
have to label it that way.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
When you add MSG to
a restaurant meal,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
your ticket goes up
by 30% because if I

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
was to give you
MSG in your food,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
you would say this
tastes really good

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.575 align:middle line:84%
but then you're going
to order dessert,

00:16:25.575 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
because it caused a
blood sugar crash.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you know about
MSG, you don't eat MSG,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
you have less headaches
and you have more focus.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a major toxin
in our food supply.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But maybe not as important
as artificial sweeteners.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
New research just came
out about sucralose.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It is terrible for
your gut microbiome

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:90%
and it causes DNA damage.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's still judged to be safe
by the regulatory authorities.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's an artificial
sweetener, don't do it.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I keep saying, maybe it's
even worse, artificial colors.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
These are things tied to brain
problems, especially in kids.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:84%
If your food has
artificial colorings,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.638 align:middle line:84%
it's not food anymore,
it's an industrial product

00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you could
paint something with it

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
but don't eat it.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
There are two more forms
of toxins to be aware of.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
One of them is chronic
stress, emotional stress,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and life stress.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.748 align:middle line:84%
And if you're under
endless stress,

00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you've got to learn
how to handle it better

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
or to change your environment
so that you have a chance

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to recover from the stress.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
And the final toxin
is something that we

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
talk about in another
one of the episodes,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and that is junk light.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.182 align:middle line:84%
If you're underneath
lighting at work

00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:34.682 align:middle line:84%
that gives you a
headache every day,

00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
that is a chronic stressor.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to classify
LED lighting that makes you

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:10%
feel unwell as a form of toxin.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Just be aware of that.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, there
is a fix for that.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do you do about this?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I just painted this scary
world picture for you.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff is
real, it's out there

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
but you don't need to be afraid,
you just want to be aware.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Your body has three
main systems for detox

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to hack those.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The first one is the
lymphatic system.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And its job is to
remove cellular waste

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't have its own pump
so you have to move your body.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
This is why 20
minutes of walking

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
every day or similar
movement is so important.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can also do lymphatic
drainage massage if you want.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:90%
The second system is your liver.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And your liver carries
out detox processes.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We call them phase
1 and phase 2 detox,

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to teach you how
to hack those in a little bit.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
is your kidneys.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
They regulate your electrolyte
and your fluid levels.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:90%
They filter your blood.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And they send waste
products into urine.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
in humans, we handle

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
a lot of toxins in our kidneys
but most animals, like rats,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:90%
handle toxins in their liver.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Your liver is better than
your kidneys at most toxins

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
so humans are more
susceptible to toxins

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
because of the way we detox
with our kidneys and our liver.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you do for
each of these systems?

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, for your lymphatic
system, light touch massage.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So as a guy, I'm like, yeah,
give me the deep Swedish.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Make it hurt.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like a feathery
light petting that moves lymph.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you get a lymphatic
drainage massage,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
it's strangely relaxing.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You can also learn how
to give one to yourself.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:90%
There's diagrams online.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.272 align:middle line:84%
If your face is puffy, you can
actually do lymphatic drainage

00:19:25.272 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
on your face, and magically
if you hit the right spots,

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:90%
it goes away.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I talked about walking.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Whole body vibration is
a great hack for that.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:10%
So what I do at home is I have
a whole body vibration platform

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:10%
and I stand on that
every now and then

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:10%
even between meetings,
because that also

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:10%
handles the I'm sitting for too
long if I'm working all day.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
necessarily go outside

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.768 align:middle line:90%
if it's raining or something.

00:19:49.768 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So whole body vibration works,
so do those little trampoline

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, a 2012 systematic review
of 50 different studies on lymph

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:10%
found that sweating helped to
remove lead, cadmium, arsenic,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:10%
and mercury.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:10%
So you really, really
want to consider

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:10%
doing an infrared sauna or
any kind of sauna really,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:10%
but infrared saunas
remove metals more quickly

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:10%
than a regular sauna.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But any kind of sauna helps
you live longer and helps

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:90%
you detox.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
The full spectrum infrared that
does near mid and far infrared

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:90%
is your best for toxin release.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
For your liver to do those phase
1 and phase 2 detox things,

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to have specific
vitamins and minerals.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people believe, oh
I should get all my vitamins

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and minerals from mother nature.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
that, then you also

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
should only get your
toxins from mother nature.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have to move
somewhere on the planet with no

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
artificial lighting, no EMFs
including from Starlink--

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:90%
thanks, Elon--

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and no toxins even though
the toxins we've made

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
are now in every
part of the planet.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So you're living in a cave,
maybe in the Antarctic,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.395 align:middle line:84%
and then you can get all
of your detox molecules

00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
from mother nature
because you only got

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:90%
your toxins from mother nature.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Since that's not you,
this is why you need

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to know what I'm sharing here.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
There are the 3Gs of detox.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And if this is all you walk
away from this episode with,

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you've got to remember
these because if you just

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
upregulate these,
you've got most

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of the problems
at least improved.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
The first G is glutathione.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And glutathione is the
primary detox antioxidant

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
in your liver and your brain.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:10%
The second one is glucaric acid,
and you take that in something

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:10%
called calcium D-glucarate.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is the secondary
way of getting rid of toxins.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And the third way of
getting rid of toxins

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is called conjugation
via glycine.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:10%
You take glutathione, you
take calcium D-glucarate,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:10%
and you take glycine, and you
get rid of most of the toxins

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:10%
that I just shared with you.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:10%
That whole long list, those
3Gs will handle all of them.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Even things like BPA, which is a
major endocrine disruptor, it's

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
found in women's
sports bras now,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:84%
it's in cash register
receipts, it's

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
in all the plastic
lining on everything.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The only way to get rid of that
is the second G with glucarate.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.373 align:middle line:84%
So you can do it now
because you understand

00:22:07.373 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:90%
that these are so important.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
I take those every day.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
There's also precursors
for glutathione

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that may work for you if
you have the right genetics

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and you have all the other
cofactors and minerals.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:84%
These are things like inositol
cysteine, glutamine or alpha

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
lipoic acid, which you
probably should take anyway

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
for energetic reasons
not for detox reasons.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:10%
Glutathione is
something that you

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:10%
want to take most days
but not every single day

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:10%
so your body doesn't get
used to just always having it

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:10%
externally.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I take it probably
five days a week.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You can get some glucaric acid
in oranges, apples, broccoli,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:90%
but you won't get enough.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:10%
I like a gram a day of
calcium D-glucarate.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:10%
This is one of those
just unrecognized,

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:10%
unsung detox molecules
that ought to be there.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things that
happens when you take calcium

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
D-glucarate is that
it helps your body get

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.255 align:middle line:84%
rid of excess estrogen.
So if you're a guy

00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and you have high
testosterone because you're

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
living the right
biohacking lifestyle,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
or like me, you supplement
testosterone to keep

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
your levels where you
want them, testosterone

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:90%
will turn into estrogen.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And some women have
excess estrogen.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So giving your
liver what it needs

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of
either xenoestrogens

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
or man-made estrogen, well,
maybe that's a good idea.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:90%
That's calcium D-glucarate.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that can
make a huge difference for you

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:90%
is taking more electrolytes.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I talk about minerals a
lot but potassium, sodium,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and magnesium help your liver
detox as well as your kidneys.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I put it in my water almost
all the time or drink mineral

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
There's another
form of calcium that

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
is unknown for most people.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:90%
It's called calcium AEP.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And it protects your
kidneys from damage

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and it helps you to maintain
cellular mineral balance

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:90%
so I take that from my kidneys.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
When I know I've been
exposed to toxins

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.888 align:middle line:84%
or I know I'm going
to a restaurant

00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and the food's a little bit sus
but I want to eat it anyway,

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I take activated
charcoal with it.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It works for many toxins,
including mold and some metals.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I also use activated charcoal
before I go into the sauna

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
so that as my body
starts to dump toxins,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I can catch it with charcoal.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.755 align:middle line:84%
Charcoal is like a sponge that
absorbs toxins in the gut.

00:24:08.755 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
That means those toxins
don't hit your liver,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
they don't hit your kidneys,
they don't hit your lymph.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You just poop them out
instead of processing them

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I notice a huge difference
with toxic mold.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm eating leftovers or
some food that maybe I think

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
isn't maybe kind of fast
food-ish, huge difference

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in how you feel later.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
In one study, activated charcoal
increased the lifespan of older

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:90%
animals by an average of 34%.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You think you want to
take that detox molecule?

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The one thing about charcoal,
take it at least 2 hours away

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
from your other supplements
because it'll absorb drugs

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.880 align:middle line:84%
like pharmaceuticals,
prescription

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.172 align:middle line:90%
drugs, over-the-counter things.

00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It'll absorb some vitamins
and some minerals but not all.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.473 align:middle line:84%
So I just like to take it
a half hour before meal,

00:24:53.473 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
then I eat some food,
then I take my vitamins,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm good to go.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:90%
But otherwise, 2 hours away.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
If you know you have mold as
part of your toxin problem,

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and many of us do,
I certainly did,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:84%
you can also take
something called

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:90%
zeolite and bentonite clay.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
These are both
specific clays that

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
will electrically
attract mold toxins

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:90%
so you can get rid of them.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take a drug
called cholestyramine

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
which is a prescription thing
that you work with a doctor

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Another massive detoxer
is something called

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Modified Citrus Pectin or MCP.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.385 align:middle line:84%
That will bind to lead,
cadmium, arsenic, and thallium.

00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You put a scoop of
it in your smoothie.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
That one is not for
kids or teenagers.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.310 align:middle line:84%
In one study, about 15 grams
of modified citrus pectin

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
per day for 5 days caused
significant levels of metals

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:90%
to be passed through urine.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You literally get
it out of your body.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
called fulvic acid, which

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
is present in danger coffee and
you can buy it as a supplement

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's small enough
to pass into cells

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
where it can bind to metals
so your body can excrete them.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
There's chlorella, which
is a fractured cell wall

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
algae that can bind to
mercury in your gut.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what I eat
when I have sushi so

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:90%
that I don't lose my balance.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you really have
problems with lead,

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:90%
you go for the big guns.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:84%
There's something
called EDTA, which

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
is a synthetic amino
acid that binds to metals

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and it diminishes their
reactivity with the body.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, EDTA is something that
you can use for self-treatment.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And to do that, you can take
capsules that are 5% absorbable

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:10%
or you can actually take
suppositories that work almost

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:10%
as well as working with a
doctor via intravenous recovery.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.007 align:middle line:84%
I will just warn
you with EDTA, it

00:26:31.007 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
will pull out the
good minerals so you

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
have to put them back in but
you need to know it exists.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
If you have calcified arteries,
if you have lots of lead,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.477 align:middle line:84%
lots of mercury,
probably you want

00:26:39.477 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to work with a functional
medicine doctor on that.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're dealing
with emotional toxins,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
you might want to pick
up a meditation practice.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia, there's so
much knowledge here.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.563 align:middle line:84%
Look at the
spirituality sections.

00:26:55.563 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
There's even an
episode here where

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I talk about ways to get into
spiritual states more quickly.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
It's important that
if you're trying

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of metals and
pesticides and all the things

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
that you know are in
there, if you're holding

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
on to a lot of chronic
stress, your body

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
won't let go of those either.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes the
emotional work has

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:84%
to happen at the same
time as the physical work,

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and this is a reality, and
any good functional medicine

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:90%
practitioner has noticed this.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The detox protocols
that I like best

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
include doing maybe
one thing at a time

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
or stacking things so you
get even greater effect.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So you might take
modified citrus pectin

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and you might take
glutathione, because they work

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:90%
via different pathways.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's good
evidence suggesting

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that if you exercise
and then hit the sauna,

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
you'll get even more benefits of
detoxing than either one alone.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So here's what you
might do on a day.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You could take 500
to 1,000 milligrams

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of liposomal
glutathione, and you

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
could take maybe a gram
of vitamin C an hour

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
before exercising.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep in mind,
this is for detox

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.073 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of vitamin C
can inhibit the muscle you

00:28:01.073 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:90%
might build from exercising.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is a different protocol.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.115 align:middle line:84%
If you just want to build
muscle, take out the vitamin C.

00:28:06.115 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You also want to take 1 gram
of calcium D-glucarate daily.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And move your body for at
least 20, maybe 30 minutes,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and you can do high intensity
interval training or any

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.582 align:middle line:84%
of the other hacks from
the fitness episode

00:28:17.582 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but don't do that
every single day.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Just go for a walk every day.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:90%
That's your default.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Take three to four activated
charcoal capsules away

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:10%
from your other supplements.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:10%
If you tend to get constipated,
back off on that number.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:10%
And then spend a few
minutes in a sauna.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.263 align:middle line:10%
Studies show 20 minutes
provide benefits.

00:28:34.263 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:10%
You might want to go
a little bit longer

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:10%
but don't go beyond an hour.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.225 align:middle line:10%
And remember, if you're
in the sauna for that

00:28:39.225 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:10%
long, lots of water, lots
of electrolytes in the water

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:10%
because water helps
your kidneys detox.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:90%
So here's the deal.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:90%
The world is full of toxins.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason to
be stressed about it.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But there is a reason to say,
I am aware of this toxin,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
therefore, I will minimize
my exposure to it.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK, sometimes
you're going to be exposed,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
you will survive
and you will thrive.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And because you will
be exposed sometimes,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to do the Triple G

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to do
some of the detox practices

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.698 align:middle line:90%
you just learned about.

00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
all of them, pick some.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to notice
your skin looks different.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to notice that you
don't get puffy in the morning.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Your joints don't get stiff.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Your back doesn't hurt.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:90%
You're happier.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:90%
You're more focused.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
This is biohacking.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why it matters
so much because when

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
you drop the toxins
you're exposed to,

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and you lower the
toxins in your body,

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:90%
your energy levels go way up.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:84%

this is Biohacking.
