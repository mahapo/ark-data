00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
shape of our future?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:10%
Are we racing for
ecological catastrophe

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:10%
and total surveillance, or will
technology liberate humanity

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:10%
from all constraints as
we learn to change our DNA

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:10%
and merge with machines?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.180 align:middle line:84%
On this episode, we're
speaking with John Peterson

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Arlington
Institute, a futurist

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:84%
think tank, and
Carter Cleveland,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the CEO of artsy.net,
about what lies ahead.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at how
social technologies can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
transform the art
world, and how art

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
could provide the model for how
we redesign society as a whole.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:58.932 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:00.465 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: What's
exciting you the most

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:90%
at Fashion Week this week?

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.835 align:middle line:90%
The outfits are amazing.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
We just saw J. Manuel
and June Ambrose.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been liking a
lot of the edgy looks.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of spikes and
rhinestones and diamonds.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The Thakoon show is
extremely exciting.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Organza.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Organza's everywhere right now.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Polka dots and some plaid,
like all mixed together.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Men with skirts.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Leather boots or sandals that
go up to-- above the knee,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
wrapped in leather,
that probably

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.337 align:middle line:90%
take 10 minutes to put on.

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Did you make the clothes
that you're wearing?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.674 align:middle line:90%
No, not today.

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:90%
I made the headpiece, though.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Sohan design coat jacket.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.511 align:middle line:84%
$2,800 purse?
Wow.

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:90%
This one?

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
My gloves are by
Patricia Fields.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself
a walking canvas.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You guys have a
spiritual belief?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.875 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's something
inside of us-- there's a kind

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:90%
of a spirit or an energy.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
all connected.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're from the
Bay Area, so we're really

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:90%
in touch with our spirituality.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
(LAUGHING) What do
you mean, spirituality?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:90%
I follow my ancestors' path.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I've grown up Catholic,
so I believe in heaven.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you think our
immortal soul continues

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.544 align:middle line:84%
to dress itself up in
flamboyant, fashionable

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
outfits, even after death?
-Probably.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.298 align:middle line:90%
Yes, probably.

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Hello, people of the world,
and welcome to Mind Shift.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Today I'm talking with the
extraordinary futurist,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:10%
founder of the Arlington
Institute, John Peterson.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be looking at future
trends, what's happening

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.924 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmological,
technological, genetic future,

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
what do we have to
look forward to.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it'll
be an awesome,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
fascinating discussion.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: A naval flight
officers in the US Navy, John

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
L. Peterson has worked at
various military institutions

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
In 1989 he founded the
Arlington Institute,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
a futurist think
tank specializing

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
in predictive modeling
of future events.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The main objective of
the Arlington Institute

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is to discover the early
indicators of transition,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and to provide solutions.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
He was awarded Outstanding
Academic Book in 1995

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
by Choice Academic Review for
his work, The Road to 2015:

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Profiles of the Future, and is
acclaimed as one of the world's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.677 align:middle line:90%
most important futurists.

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.539 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.401 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
-Daniel.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
John, it's nice to see you.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.189 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for coming today.
-Thanks.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about-- how did you get

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:90%
so interested in the future?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Hmm, oh, that's a long,
kind of circuitous story.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:10%
But I was working
in the White House,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:10%
and looking out at
the kind of the future

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:10%
of the military and
national security,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:10%
and ended up going
out and looking

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:10%
at breakthrough technologies
and strange science,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:10%
and other kinds of things.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I figured
out was that there

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
was this convergence--
this was back 20 years

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.805 align:middle line:90%
ago-- there's a convergence.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There are these big things
that were all coming together,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
climate change and technology
and social value shifts.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They were all coming
together inexorably,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and going to fundamentally
change who we all were.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And then one day somebody
said, oh you're a futurist,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%
said I said, oh, OK.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But I've been fascinated
about it all ever since.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So how is the future looking
from where we are now?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary, Daniel.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We're at this amazing
kind of transition

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:90%
in time that's unprecedented.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That essentially,
in my opinion, we're

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
at a period-- we're at the
punctuation in the evolution

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:90%
of the species.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.124 align:middle line:84%
You can go back, way back,
to single cellular life,

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:23.671 align:middle line:84%
and multiple cellular life,
and vertebrates and mammals

00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a regular
predictable period,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
cyclical period,
that each time you

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
can predict that there's
going to be these major kind

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:90%
of transitions.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're at one
of those right now.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And what's going
to come out of it?

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be quite obvious.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
It's already mainline; science
is coming to the conclusion

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
that grandchildren and
great grandchildren

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
are going to be genetically
different than who

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:90%
we are right now.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's a new human
that's emerging out of this.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's enabled by a number of
things, including cosmic energy

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and technology and so on.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm a little confused.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a pause
on that for a second.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little confused
about what you're saying

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:90%
about this genetic change.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not
saying it's going

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to be caused by genetic
engineering, or biotechnology,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
or by us merging with machines
in a Kurzweillian sense, or a--

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil is
a friend, but I'm

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:90%
not a fan of that whole notion.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Which is not to say that
technology and science is not

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:90%
going to have its role to play.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The notion we're talking
about is the singularity idea

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that Ray Kurzweil has
populated, that somehow

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
humans and technology, man and
machine, are going to merge.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have, like, nanobots
in all of our organs--

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Right, running
around in your brain.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Do the breathing
for us, and so on.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't doubt that that's
all possible at some point,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and that it plays a role.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now, there're only
probably half a dozen organs

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
in your body that
cannot be artificially

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%
produced in one way or another.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're manufacturing
these things with 3D printers.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, sure.
Technology--

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I want to note
that John's-- the Arlington

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Institute publishes
The Future Edition,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
which is-- I totally recommend
people subscribing to it.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
compendium of news stories,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
essays, kind of really
gives you a sense

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
of the divergent potential
that we're moving into.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.901 align:middle line:84%
So what do you mean by
genetic transformation

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
of the human species?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really
quite interesting.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Because certainly there's
any number of things

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing to our
cells, and that science

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is doing, that probably
that's going to influence.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's genetic engineering
going on, forever, in every way

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:90%
that you can think about it.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But the most fascinating
thing, and the thing

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that's compatible with
this generational shift,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is that there are now
numerous sources that suggest

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that there's different kind
energy coming out of the sun

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
center of the galaxy

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't seen before.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.371 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming over a
period of time, over decades.

00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
What's the evidence
that backs that up?

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's NASA measurements
and other kind of things that

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
certainly show
that the energy is

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
changing, that there
are certain aspects

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of the energy that's changing.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, weren't we expecting
a solar maximum, that

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
kind of hasn't really happened?

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
The last week, as
a matter of fact,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
there just were--
for a number of days,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
there were almost
no solar spots.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading
that the heliosphere, which

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a protective
energy the sun puts out,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
has actually
decreased in strength,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
like 50% over the last decades.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It has.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a combination
of these kinds of things.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening,
also, to the earth's

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic field?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the magnetic
field is also decreasing,

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of
the problem as well.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Because what that does is effect
the amount of the cosmic rays

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that can come from
not only the sun,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
but also from the
center the galaxy.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any idea as to
why the electromagnetic field

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of the earth is decreasing?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Because a couple of reasons.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a regular
kind of magnetic pole

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:90%
shift that goes on.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we've been seeing
for the last 150 years

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.622 align:middle line:84%
is a decrease in the
amount of the intensity

00:08:15.622 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
in the definition of the
north and south magnetic pole.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.926 align:middle line:84%
And now it's starting to morph,
and it's a rapidly changing.

00:08:25.926 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And what they believe is
that in the next, maybe 20

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
years or something
like that, you

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:90%
might get a literal pole shift.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
When you say they, who
are some of the most

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
credible scientists or
researchers that people might--

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.453 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I couldn't tell
you individuals,

00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:90%
but this is broadly based.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's in NASA
and NOAA and it's

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
just not a question at all
about magnetic pole shift.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Well then, do you share,
kind of, the hypothesis

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of certain thinkers
like Jose Arguelles,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or more mystical
thinkers like [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe, that somehow humanity
is in an evolutionary process

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that involves this
transformation

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.861 align:middle line:84%
That somehow synchronized to
these larger cosmic processes?

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the-- and this
is the-- first of all,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not magic.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It's only magic if you
can't understand it.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So something is going on that's
understandable, if you're

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
able to understand it.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm suggesting is that
in the context of those kinds

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of philosophical, if you
will, kind of framework

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
or explanations is
some real science that

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
says, at this point, what it
looks like is that there's

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:84%
energy coming out
of the sun that

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is enabling dormant
aspects of your DNA, that

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:90%
have been dormant so far.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, the 90+%
they call junk DNA.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And that they're activating it.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And when that turns
on, what it does

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is it starts to facilitate
the emergence of capabilities

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't had in the past.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And we become a new species,
a new version of the species.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It would be great to figure
out who are the leading

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:90%
sources for that information.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Well on that side of it, it's
necessarily unconventional.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the
conventional guys are

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:90%
pretty much inside their box.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there are any
number of channel sources,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
like kryon, if you're
familiar with kryon, that--

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's so interesting,
because you began

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of government--
because you worked in the White

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.404 align:middle line:84%
House, I think you were
Naval Intelligence,

00:10:19.404 --> 00:10:20.869 align:middle line:84%
or something like that?
-No.

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Naval--

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I flew aircraft, airplanes.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
How do you make a shift
to accepting, at least--

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I had an out of
body experience.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I found myself on
the ceiling, sitting

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:90%
there looking at myself.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And once I figured out after the
fact what had happened, I said,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
god, this has got
to-- this doesn't-- I

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
can't understand this.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I went off, as
I said, and was looking

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
at these new science things.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured out that
new ideas would show up

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:90%
in these areas of new science.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down one
day to a workshop

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and heard Cleve Backster explain
to me how he had wired up

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
plants, and that they
talked, and they understood,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and they anticipated, and
they knew what he said

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and everything, and
it just blew my mind.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And the logic was right there,
made sense to this engineer.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it just drove
me into this space

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that said it was--
operates-- it's much bigger

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's much more
interesting, frankly,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:90%
than what we understand.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Well let's-- we'll
come back to the more

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:90%
esoteric aspects of it.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm also curious
about your analysis--

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
your book on 2012,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and your analysis that
there are-- you know,

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the inertia of
the current system

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to eventually
force some type

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.964 align:middle line:90%
of breakdown and reconfiguring.

00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether
it's the financial--

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We're watching it today.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
We're, you know, we're--

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Explain how.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.853 align:middle line:90%
Because in some ways it seems--

00:11:45.853 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the financial system
is going over a cliff.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's slowly
going over a cliff,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:10%
it's not going to just
have an abrupt failure.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But today our government has--
is unable to pay its bills.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're scrambling
around like crazy to try

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:90%
to figure out a way to do that.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, an article
I just read this morning

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
is about the dark
economy, which is

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
working itself toward
the self destruction

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:90%
of the financial system.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
1.2 quadrillion

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
dollars worth of value in
derivatives, none of which

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:90%
are regulated.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what you've got is
this whole unregulated thing

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
underneath that's
propping up the system.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And when it starts
to turn, and it

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
comes unglued, which
it's starting to do,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
then the whole
system comes down.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is open up a vacuum

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
for the emergence
of a new world.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I spend my
time trying to think about,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is what's this new world,
and what might it look like,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and how might it work?

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seemed leading
up to, for instance, 2012,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it seemed more likely that
this-- this disruptive event

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
on the financial scale
or whatever might happen

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:90%
more rapidly or radically.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, I think some
people, myself included,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
are actually kind of impressed
with how the system has

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
stabilized itself.
-Yeah.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
because I, too,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
thought that on a
number of occasions--

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't just me.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
A number of people said,
man, next week, the thing

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
can't maintain itself.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out that there
is a whole lot of people who

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
are trying to keep this thing
going, and keep it propped up,

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
and throw money.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, particularly,
we saw just money get

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.595 align:middle line:84%
thrown into the financial
system unlike anything

00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
had ever happened ever
before in history.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And nobody just-- nobody
thought that that was

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:90%
an option that was available.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of creativity that

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
goes into trying to
maintain the status quo,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
but they're going to run out--
they're running out of options.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
see in terms of what

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:84%
you study, in terms
of a climate change,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
where we're heading
in that area?

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Climate change is
interesting because I think

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's very
significant emerging

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:90%
indications from broadly based.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of it comes
from Russia, but it's

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:90%
more broadly based now.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
That is suggesting that we're
not in the global warming.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:90%
No global warming.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
The planet has not
warmed in 12 years.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:90%
That's solid science.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
and what we've seen

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is the rap-- the oscillation
before you get a state change.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been
hotter and it's been

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
colder on this planet, different
places, for the last few years

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.933 align:middle line:90%
than it's ever been.

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:90%
We've been-- we've got more ice.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.094 align:middle line:84%
There's more ice in the Arctic
that-- that grew this season

00:14:41.094 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:90%
than in any time in the past.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So you don't, for instance,
agree with somebody

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
like Bill McKibben?
-No.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
-No?
-No, I don't.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're not looking
at the full spectrum of things.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, what
you're moving toward,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I think, and it'll be obvious
in about three or four years,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
be a mini Ice Age.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And it'll last for maybe-- what
the best science now looks at,

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.500 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the trends,
the times in the past,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and how long it is,
and how it starts,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- that it'll
probably be about a--

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:90%
they call it about a generation.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:90%
20, 25 years or something.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It'll be really cold and
then it'll probably--

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll
come back probably.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought it was
pretty clear that the science

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
on global warming
was fairly convincing

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.761 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a million tons
of CO2 into the atmosphere

00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
every hour--
-Yeah.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Look at the new IPCC report
that's going to-- they

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
just leaked it yesterday.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding out is
that they-- all of their models

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
overstated the warming by
a factor of, in some cases,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:90%
a factor of three.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
The planet has not warmed
the amount that they all

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:90%
thought it was going to warm.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And now they're scrambling
around, trying to maintain--

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out some kind of way

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to maintain-- keep the
machine and the funding going.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:90%
And the ideas going.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, science has got
all of this vested interest

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in keeping their ideas doing.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And-- and-- that they're
very hard to-- they

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
don't back down and change
their mind very easily.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And particularly when there's
a lot of money involved.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's take another
area of prediction,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:90%
which would be technology.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective,
you mentioned

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that you don't buy into
the singularity idea

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of man and machine merging.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:84%
What-- where do you think
technology is heading?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of impact is that
going to have in the future?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know if I'd
quite say it that way, Daniel.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The-- the-- you--
you're clearly moving

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
yourself into an exponential
increase in technology.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Unprecedented.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you easily, in
Ray Kurzweilian terms,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
you could get yourself
out to a place and say,

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:84%
my, oh, my, the machines take
over, the computers, and we all

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:90%
start to work for 'em.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
necessarily going to happen,

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
but you can see that.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, you can see
that in terms of strong AI,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:90%
strong artificial intelligence.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Strong artifi-- we
all know about what

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence is.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.490 align:middle line:84%
That's when you pick up the
phone to call the airline

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and you get this voice
on the other that says,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
punch one, or two, or tell me.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:90%
That's artificial intelligence.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not real, but it
has a distinct kind of set

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:90%
of things it knows how to do.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Strong AI, real and
artificial intelligence,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is when somebody like-- when
you've got an agent, a computer

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:90%
agent, that acts like you.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Lord.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
What-- what-- what
would that be like?

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a human
being, like a research--

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
like a research
assistant or someone

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
like that, that goes
out to find things,

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and checks with somebody
else, and makes decisions,

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and comes back, and so on.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd-- I tell the story about--
you go to your agent and say,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:90%
I need some tires on my car.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And the agent says, well, OK.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the agent knows
what kind of car

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
you got, and knows
what size tires,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and knows how long
you've driven it,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and it goes, and
finds them, and says--

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So-- so in that
sense, you're seeing

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
a world where technology
is more responsive

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:90%
to human desire and need.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
can do, in fact,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is layer these things, so
that you can put it-- 100,000

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of them all on top
of each other to try

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
to solve intractable and
seemingly intractable problems.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.101 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does
is blow open the--

00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You have people like the
authors of that book Abudance--

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Saying that think
that technology

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
will evolve to solve all human
problems the next 30 years.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Now we only have a
few minutes before we

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
bring out our next guest.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.116 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to bring the two of you

00:18:18.116 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:90%
together to chat.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.565 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would ask
you also-- because I

00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
know you mentioned channeling.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're also
interested in kind

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
of the psychic, paranormal,
kind of extrasensory aspects

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of this transition.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain to me
how-- is the future integrate

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
or incorporate kind
of a deeper and wider

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the psyche?
-Yeah.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I think it's inevitable.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I back-- I back
myself up to the basic notion

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
is that it's going
to have change,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:90%
then it's going to change.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:90%
It is not going to be like this.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And every other time you have
one of those transitions,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
from the previous one, it would
be impossible to anticipate

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.414 align:middle line:90%
the succeeding one.

00:18:57.414 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
single cellular life

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.814 align:middle line:84%
and you look
around, you're never

00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
going to figure out
that there's going to be

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
multiple cellular life, right?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we are
literally at this place

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
where the future is, in
general terms, unthinkable.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It has the potential to be
so dramatically different

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
than anything we think.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy that and you're
able to kind of work your way

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
into that space to make some
sense out of it, what you

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
immediately do is
start to say, well,

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
what could we do differently?

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And you end at the
psychic and the-- the--

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
do-- do-- do telepathy,

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and to manifestation, and any
number of other kind of things.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And the indicators are there.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.001 align:middle line:90%
And there are many kind of--

00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
What-- what do you mean,
the indicators are there?

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
many, many sources,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
necessarily unconventional
because this is-- we're talking

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
unconventional things, who
independently come to the--

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
come to the same
conclusion and say, well,

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the characteristics
of this in the human

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the ability
to manifest faster.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the best
guess and understanding

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that I have about how reality
works is consciousness

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:90%
is causal.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And your consciousness in
time kind of manifests itself

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
into causality.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And you get this glass
came from an idea

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
that somebody first had.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And then in time, it
made itself into that.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, the whole notion of
accelerating the manifestation

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is to shorten that
period between the idea

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and the intention to the
physical-- physical form.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And if that starts to
happen, and many sources

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
say that that's kind of
what's going to happen,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
then what you start to get is an
acceleration of the whole kind

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.666 align:middle line:84%
of system, in terms of the
people being able to manifest

00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and-- and produce
the essential kind

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.761 align:middle line:84%
of functions and components
of the new world.

00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.126 align:middle line:84%
So what I get from you is
that all we've got to do

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is think the unthinkable and
accelerate the manifestation.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It-- it-- it's not
quite that simple,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.876 align:middle line:84%
but that's essentially it.
Yeah.

00:20:54.876 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
-Right on.
-Yeah.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:90%
There-- there's a process.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
process of intention.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.521 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with feeling,
and it has to do clear imagery,

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and so on.
But yes.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So do you feel that, in
terms of your own work,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of formulating these
models, or mappings,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
or predictions somehow
can help influence

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:90%
the future to come into--

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Ab-- absolutely.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's the
essential thing for people,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:10%
like you and I, who are
interested in this new world.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:10%
The whole objective
is to build a model,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:10%
build an image that
you can hold up

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:10%
that starts to make some
sense for a lot of folks,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:10%
so they can look at it.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.325 align:middle line:84%
And you get-- you
get entrainment.

00:21:30.325 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
You get lots of people
that are starting

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:90%
to say, yeah, that could work.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be blue
instead of green.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:90%
And you kind of shape it.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
does not exist now.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.800 align:middle line:84%
A model of what the new world
looks like does not exist.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what one of the
projects that we're working on

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
at The Arlington Institute--
is to start to build

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a simple model, that
you can hold up,

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can
shoot at, but at least

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
it starts the conversation.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.716 align:middle line:84%
Well, listen, when we
come back with you,

00:21:54.716 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to discuss
how art can contribute

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:90%
to formulating that model.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.401 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much.
-Yes.

00:21:58.401 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk
in another minute.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So our next guest is Carter
Cleveland, the founder

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:90%
and CEO of artsy.net.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
how social technologies

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
are transforming the art world
and the world in general.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little bit
about Burning Man.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.721 align:middle line:90%
And let's-- let's get on.

00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Carter Cleveland is
the founder of the website,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Artsy, which he created
during his senior year

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:10%
at Princeton University.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the
site is to quote,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
"be the place where every
single user in the world

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:90%
goes to discover art online."

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Son of art historian and
collector, David Cleveland,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Carter has successfully
fund raised over $7 million

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:90%
for his site.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:10%
Artsy created the
Art Genome Project,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:10%
a study of the characteristics
that distinguish and connect

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:10%
works of original art.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:10%
In May, 2010, Artsy
received the Yahoo

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:10%
Rookie Award in the New
York City conference,

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:10%
TechCrunch Disrupts.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.979 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:50.817 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:50.817 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you, Carter.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for having me.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.189 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor.
-Thanks.

00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And so tell me a
little bit about Artsy.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:10%
How you got started with
it and what your vision is.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So at Artsy, our
vision is we want art

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
to become as important
a part of human culture

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:90%
as music is today.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Our mission is to
make all the world's

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:84%
art accessible to anyone
with an internet connection.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
That's how we think we're going
to make our vision possible.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:10%
And our goal, as a business--
so we are-- we're a for-profit.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:10%
And the only way
something so ambitious

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:10%
would ever be
financially possible

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:10%
or sustainable is by
tapping into the market

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:10%
and also expanding
the art market.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So as a business, our goal,
certainly in the short term,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is to be the best place on
the internet to discover art,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and also to collect
art, and buy art.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
On Artsy, we have, by
far, the largest rights

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
cleared database of modern
and contemporary fine art

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
You can go there and you
can learn all about it.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have something called
The Art Genome Project, which

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is inspired by Pandora's
Music Genome Project, which

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is essentially
metadata that's applied

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to every artist and artwork.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
We call this metadata--
we call them genes.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But what they really
are is they are

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
scores for every
possible characteristic

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that could apply to art.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, you could
imagine a Mark Rothko work

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
having 100 in abstract
expressionism,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and 100 in New York school,
and maybe an 80 in color field

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
painting, and maybe a 40 in
geometric because of the sort

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:90%
of rough geometric composition.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And the average artwork
has between 20 to 30 genes.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We use The Art Genome Project
to recommend other works of art

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:90%
you might like.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.365 align:middle line:84%
And so people can sort
of trace paths through--

00:24:39.365 --> 00:24:40.665 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
if I go to Amazon,

00:24:40.665 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:90%
it will recommend books to me.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Or if I go to Spotify,
it'll recommend music.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And so on.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a way to
both learn about the art,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
but also discover new things
and kind of walk through space

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and time through art history.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
interested in buying,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
you can also see
what's exhibiting

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
at all the top galleries
around the world.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And you get a
personal specialist

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
who will work with
you, answer questions,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:90%
can help you transact.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But tell me a little bit about
like your personal passion.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I understand your father
was an art critic.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was there--
did you come into this

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
with some particular
mission or sense

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.355 align:middle line:84%
that there was like a need
that needed to be met here?

00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's interesting.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't have the typical
background of an entrepreneur.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I was not selling
lemonade as a kid,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.011 align:middle line:84%
but it really does-- it really
does come from my parents.

00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So yes.
My father is an art writer.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And from a very young
age, I was extremely lucky

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that I got-- well, often
dragged to galleries

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and museums as a kid.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And he would, very patiently,
talk to me about the art.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this very kind
of strong passion for art

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:90%
from a young age.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But actually, my
mom's side of family

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is all sort of a long line
of physicists, some of whom

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:90%
are quite famous.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I really excelled at,
as a kid, was math and physics.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.541 align:middle line:84%
And my goal was actually to
be a theoretical physicist

00:25:55.541 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:90%
when I grew up.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I originally went
to school for physics,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
but I ended up falling
in love with programming.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, I saw a course
called Artificial Intelligence.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I read a lot of
science fiction as a kid.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when I-- when I saw
that I could actually now

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
learn about it and
like build AI myself,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
it was-- I basically
switched my major just

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:90%
to be able to take that course.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And I fell in love programming.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was during my
senior year of college

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
when I was looking
around online.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there was
Netflix for-- for all

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:90%
the world's films.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was Pandora for
all the world's music.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And right around
the corner, Spotify

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
was coming out for
all the world's art--

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:90%
oh, all the world's music.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.701 align:middle line:84%
And it just felt like a
giant gap in the internet

00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
was missing.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Like where is the platform
with all the world's art?

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, what a fantastic
opportunity to work on the two

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:84%
things I was passionate about
because it seemed clear to me

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that whatever filled
that gap would

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
have a recommendation and
artificial intelligence

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:90%
component to it.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I really had no idea
about kind of business

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:84%
or how we would make
money at the time.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.735 align:middle line:84%
But I'm happy to say
that five years later,

00:26:59.735 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
it's-- it actually looks like
this could be quite a massive,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:90%
successful, commercial business.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I know you've gotten
some investment here

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.771 align:middle line:84%
from some major galleries like
[INAUDIBLE], and [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:09.771 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and so on.
-Mm hm.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So-- and do you think there's
anything about the art world

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in it's current form
that needs to change

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:90%
or open up in some way?

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think there's
any way that Artsy can help

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.095 align:middle line:90%
kind of bring about that shift?

00:27:23.095 --> 00:27:24.589 align:middle line:84%
You know?
-Yeah.

00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that there
are-- there are largely

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:84%
two things about the art
world that I think we would

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:90%
like to positively impact.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:84%
On the business level,
there's a lot of inefficiency.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want to buy or sell
art in the market today,

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:90%
it's very inefficient.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long time and
it can be very hard to find

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:90%
the optimal counter party.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And the transaction
costs are very high.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So we think we can
lower those costs.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:90%
We think we can speed it up.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We think we can,
most importantly,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
greatly expand the market,
which means more artists are

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to pursue their
passions in a sustainable way.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of on the business
and the economic side.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
On the cultural side, you know,
you'll notice a big difference

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
between, you know, if you
record the average conversation

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
about art and kind of--
you take out all the words

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and you just listen to the
tones and the frequencies.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you take the
average conversation

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
about film or about music.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Average conversation
in the art world.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:31.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot-- you'll just
notice a lot more-- I would say

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot more conversations
that are not even actually

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%
about the art.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
There are often people being
upset about how much money

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:84%
certain people are making,
or how much things cost,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.266 align:middle line:84%
or there's a lot
kind of like meta

00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
conversation about the
state of the market itself.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in-- you know,
you can talk to anyone

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you want on the
street about music

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and get into this
passionate conversation

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
about the last concert
you went to, or about how

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:90%
this song made you feel.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.134 align:middle line:84%
And no one's afraid
to ask questions.

00:28:59.134 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, I didn't
really get that movie.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not-- I don't
really understand

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:90%
why the director did that.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, I just didn't
really like this movie.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
In the art world,
there's a lot of fear.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people are afraid
to ask questions, to admit

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
understand things.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.531 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
critical jargon also.

00:29:14.531 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you find it in the
art magazines and so on.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.929 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:16.929 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
telling you, you know,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:84%
if you don't understand all
these fancy words we're using,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
you sort of don't
deserve to be part of it.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:90%
So there's this intimidation.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
There are all these
negative emotions.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It almost has like a magical,
religious language that's

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
formulated around
it, which maybe has

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to do with the enshrining
these objects at such

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous level
of value, you know.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And we very much
believe in notion

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of-- of the sacred
nature of the art

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and how important the art is.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And-- and in the same way that
there are beautiful museums

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and churches erected
to honor art,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
we believe-- we take that
same level of seriousness

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
with the digital product we
are creating on the internet.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We really believe
Artsy-- or we are trying

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to make Artsy the
most beautiful place

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:90%
on the internet to house art.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:10%
That being said,
this notion of art

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:10%
being something that some people
don't deserve to have access

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:10%
to, or that should
be intimidating,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:10%
or that you should--
that the notion

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.810 align:middle line:10%
of having the-- these negative
emotions, these-- the fear.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, art is fundamentally
about human expression,

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and love, and you know.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
the art market today,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:90%
you don't find as much of that.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.282 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of that comes
because there are-- there are

00:30:29.282 --> 00:30:31.650 align:middle line:84%
these latent sort of
issues and scar tissue

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:90%
beneath the surface.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
the market was more

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
open, if everyone
had access-- I mean,

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:90%
look at music 100 years ago.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
If you could talk
about going to concerts

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:84%
or-- or having seen
professional musicians play,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.160 align:middle line:84%
it was very much a sign that you
were part of a certain class.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
You are differentiating
yourself from the common

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
who didn't have that access.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But now that everyone has
access to music today,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.194 align:middle line:84%
all of those tensions
have evaporated.

00:30:55.194 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that by creating
access in the art world--

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.661 align:middle line:84%
They're very different
economic models, right?

00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:84%
What you have in the art
world and the music world.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.890 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of-- they're
kind of opposed to each other

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:84%
almost.
Or, I mean--

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
In the early days of
music, the economic model

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
was paying for a performance
and it was quite expensive.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And now you can pay
for the performance

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
or you can listen to online for
a small monthly fee to Spotify.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So we think there
are also-- the point

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
is that different
business models emerge.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, I agree with--
I haven't read the book,

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
but I guess-- I'm guessing
that the thesis of Abundance

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
is that we will live
in a world of abundance

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:90%
when information becomes free.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think in an
abundant world,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
business models will emerge to
service all social and economic

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.615 align:middle line:90%
classes.

00:31:36.615 --> 00:31:37.681 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that will happen
in the art world as well.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
In terms of a context where
art is maybe experienced

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in sometimes sacred,
sometimes as play,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
you and I share a connection
to the Burning Man Festival.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
ask you, you know,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:84%
how that has impacted your
vision and also your sense

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:90%
of the role of art in society?

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.785 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's interesting.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Burning
Man the first time--

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, how would
describe Burning Man for people

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.376 align:middle line:90%
who never have been there?

00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
What would you-- what
would you call it?

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.791 align:middle line:84%
Well, I describe it
differently than, I guess,

00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:90%
how most people do.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So I describe Burning Man
as a week long experiment

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:90%
in intentional community.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is saying, what if
we threw out all the rules, all

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the social norms, all
the legacy software

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:90%
that our society is built upon?

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Which, you know,
very useful software

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:84%
when you're out in
the jungle and you

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:90%
need to survive as a community.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, right
now, we live in this era

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:90%
of emerging abundance.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not there yet,
but we're getting there.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:84%
We can afford to-- to
try out some pretty

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
radical experiments.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think Burning Man is maybe
the best example of saying,

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:84%
let's throw out the
rule book, let's

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:84%
throw out all the
legacy software

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and start from scratch.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Just-- just one
question though.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:84%
When you say we're in a
situation of an emerging

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.170 align:middle line:84%
abundance, I mean, do you feel
that's true across the board?

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of activists
in like The Occupy Movement

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
feel that the abundance is
very, very unevenly spread.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It is, if you focus on
traditional definitions

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of abundance, which are tied to
material goods, such as money.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:84%
However-- and again
it's emerging.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But once you hit the point
where you have enough money

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a computer and
access to the internet,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the richest person
in the world spends

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
probably about 80%
of their waking

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:90%
hours in front of the screen.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in
front of the screen,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:84%
your experience is
exactly the same.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But-- but my joke is it's
like almost everybody really

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%
ultimately has the
same job these days,

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
just staring at a little
thing and going like that.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:84%
The point is money is
starting to really not matter

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:84%
for people, once they get to the
point where they have enough.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
Maslow's hierarchy.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:90%
You know, food, shelter, sex.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But then once you get
free Wi-Fi and a computer

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to access it from, the
differences really,

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:90%
really start to go away.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, it used to be,
oh my god, like how much--

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.350 align:middle line:90%
you have this much water?

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have this much water.
OK.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, water
comes out of the tap.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.014 align:middle line:90%
We stop caring about it.

00:34:13.014 --> 00:34:14.579 align:middle line:84%
It just becomes a default.
-Right.

00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, money and
physical resources

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
are moving in that same
direction as everything moves

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:84%
towards an information economy,
which can be infinitely

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.730 align:middle line:90%
leveraged by the internet.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:84%
All that's going to
matter at that point

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is, what gifts can
you give to this kind

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:90%
of information universe?

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
How can you-- you know,
it's interesting--

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is very much a
Burning Man ethos, right?

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
The gift rather than
the transaction.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.511 align:middle line:84%
And at Burning Man-- so it's a
sort of experimental community

00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
And you start
everything from scratch.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.535 align:middle line:84%
All the social norms
are completely gone.

00:34:46.535 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
You know, just to give you one
example, my-- one of my best

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
friends who's gay
complained that you can't

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:90%
tell who's gay at Burning Man.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
In the default world,
it's very obvious

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, they're
all a little better looking,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit more, you know,
ripped, and they dress better.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, at Burning Man,
everyone just looks crazy.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:90%
So you have no idea, right?

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's just one example
of when you remove

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:84%
the legacy software, one of
these beautiful, emergent

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.770 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember kind of having
this amazing experience with

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:90%
someone there the first time.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, for
her, Burning Man was

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:90%
this life changing experience.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And she was going to go back,
and she was going to leave

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:90%
her job, and move to India.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was also
life changing experience.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But for me, like I
got off the plane

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and I went straight
from the airport

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to our office still
covered in playa dust

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with like a bloody tissue
hanging out of my nose.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it was like
it gave me a vision of the way

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:84%
culture should be and the way
the world could be when it

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.330 align:middle line:84%
comes to human self expression
and how we relate to each other

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:90%
around that self expression.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And it-- and it gave me
a little vision of like,

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.150 align:middle line:84%
this is actually
what we could make

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the whole world like
if Artsy's successful

00:35:59.130 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to art.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.716 align:middle line:84%
Because in Burning Man
there's incredible art.

00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:03.416 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:03.416 --> 00:36:04.282 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly beautiful art.

00:36:04.282 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I think I-- I think I
mentioned to you that I

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:84%
wrote an article, an
essay, about Burning Man

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.599 align:middle line:84%
in the "Art Forum."
-For "Art Forum."

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:90%
For "Art Forum."

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.206 align:middle line:84%
Which ended up getting me
black balled from "Art Forum."

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I never was able to write
there again under that editor.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And partially, it was because.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I think, that I suggested that
this idea that you would just

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
have these pieces that are
much more about celebration

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:26.250 align:middle line:84%
for a whole community to share
in than the physical objects

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
future existence as an
archival work-- it was not-- it

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.170 align:middle line:90%
was not even an interest.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.290 align:middle line:84%
You actually burn the
work there, you know.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So that idea, I think, the
collector and critical base

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
for Art Forum found
threatening at that point.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Though I think that that's
beginning to change over time.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it seems to
me that contemporary art

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:84%
world a little bit supports like
a kind of egocentric worldview.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Like the ego of the
wealthy collector, the ego

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.200 align:middle line:90%
of the artist, and so on.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And Burning Man suggests
a different-- maybe

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
a more-- a healthier
relationship

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to art and creativity.
-Yeah.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, you know, I try
and always look for, you know,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.850 align:middle line:84%
what are very
tangible facts that we

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:90%
can ground these ideas in.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And it really is-- just
look at the conversations

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:90%
at Burning Man about the art.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:84%
There-- it's like
returning to this sort

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:90%
of childlike innocence.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.071 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, did
you see this one?

00:37:25.071 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It was so cool.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, yeah, it really, really
made me think about this.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Like, I didn't really get that.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Or what about this other one?

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know,
it's really cool.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, I couldn't quite
understand what the point was.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, did you
have any insight there?

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's
like these conversations

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that are just-- just-- it's
just the way it should be.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just very genuine.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It it's not like, oh, yeah, that
was-- oh, yeah, it was so deep.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, everyone pretending
like they understood it,

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:90%
but no one did.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.871 align:middle line:84%
Or like people being-- you
know, it's right there for you

00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's no--
you don't have to be

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:90%
invited to a fancy, VIP party.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Artsy does
plenty of fancy, VIP parties.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying those
things don't make sense.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:10%
But when you look at the
fundamental relationship

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:10%
of the human to the art and then
the inter-human relationships

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.300 align:middle line:10%
around the art, it's just
so positive and pure.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very tangible
thing you can feel.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, how
do you take that

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.861 align:middle line:84%
and how do you extend that
to the rest of the world?

00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So in a few minutes, we're going
to bring back on John Peterson

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and have little bit of a three
way dialogue around the future

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.761 align:middle line:84%
and what role art
plays in that future.

00:38:30.761 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We just thought maybe
talk a little bit

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:84%
about how you see
social technology,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
in general, kind of being part
of our evolutionary process.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And where you see that
that might bring us

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:90%
in 5, 10, 20 years, you know.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.925 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to.

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:10%
Do you see a trend towards
more sustainable design,

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.211 align:middle line:10%
and more sustainable
fabrics, and so on?

00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
The eco-friendly
trend is amazing.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a big turnout at
those shows, surprisingly.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's people
trying to feel good--

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Um-- it's a good question.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I never really
actually looked at it.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.065 align:middle line:84%
I think us, as,
you know, species,

00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
will always need
animals to live.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
When I source the
materials, you know,

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I do that responsibly.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.411 align:middle line:84%
All of our vendors have to
go through an audit process

00:39:12.411 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:84%
The designers are
already catching onto that

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.261 align:middle line:84%
and trying to do the best they
can to help the environment.

00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys ever get
worried that there's

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:84%
like a secret government
that's like in touch

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.230 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials?

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so
possible, but, I guess,

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter to me.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I-- I don't think
there's any aliens.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:84%
There are aliens among us
and we just don't know.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in it.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:84%
My only question is, are
you an extraterrestrial?

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Your only question.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.086 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to ask
questions, I'm the questioner.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think now, in
this time, that there's

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:84%
like a giant sort of tying
together of spirit and science?

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I definitely believe so.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm a, you know, biology
major and-- saying so,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've very
logical thinking,

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.095 align:middle line:90%
but very spiritual as well.

00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:58.795 align:middle line:84%
Why are people so focused
on all these celebrities

00:39:58.795 --> 00:40:00.240 align:middle line:84%
who have no meaning
or importance

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.820 align:middle line:90%
for their real, tangible lives?

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I feel like some people
don't have any meaning

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.995 align:middle line:84%
in their own lives, so they
look at other people's lives

00:40:05.995 --> 00:40:06.840 align:middle line:90%
for the answers.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:84%
People are going
to look and go,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:84%
wow, you know, you're
so-- what is that?

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.190 align:middle line:84%
That special, $50,000,
custom design suit.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean they are blazers
that are $15,000.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:84%
How is that different
from a blazer

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.449 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, $60 at H&M?
-Yeah.

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.059 align:middle line:84%
You tell me.
I don't know.

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:20.997 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing H&M head
to toe, my friend.

00:40:20.997 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:90%
This is Pacific Sunwear.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.250 align:middle line:84%
There you go.
I love it.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to, like, wake up and
just give thanks for everything

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that you do have,
but then always

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
realize that there's
something better

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
to keep bettering

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:90%
yourself and improving.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
If you don't make other
people's life better,

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:38.771 align:middle line:84%
you are not making a
good work in your life.

00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:40.204 align:middle line:84%
I think we should have
a little group hug.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.168 align:middle line:90%
Group hug.

00:40:41.168 --> 00:40:42.614 align:middle line:90%
Group hug.

00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:44.060 align:middle line:90%
(TOGETHER) Group hug!

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
-OK.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the
question of social technology,

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:90%
social networks.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.135 align:middle line:84%
How do you to see it
aiding in human evolution

00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:90%
in the next 5, 10, 20 years?

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see
it's going, Carter?

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I know that this is a-- people
are very divided on this issue.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:10%
I actually think that
while in the short term,

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:10%
we are experiencing a
lot of people struggling

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:10%
with addiction to
social networks--

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:10%
I think it's very similar to
when we first started using

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:10%
cars, and we didn't
have seat belts,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:10%
and we didn't understand not
to be drunk while driving.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think once we understand
how to discipline ourselves

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and deal with the increasing
distractions, which I think

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
largely will come through
people being more conscious,

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and meditating, and
understanding things like that,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I think social networks are
ultimately an incredibly

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.960 align:middle line:84%
powerful force for positive
change in the world

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and in civilization.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I think they are fundamentally
empowering people.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It will result in governments
being held more accountable

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to the people, people
having more power to rally

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.330 align:middle line:84%
against dictatorships,
and for people to stay

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:90%
more connected and positive.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think
it's going to help

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
reduce war and conflict.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Now we saw-- I'll ask
your opinion in one second,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted to follow
up on that for one second.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, some of the
Arab Spring, and the power

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of Twitter, and even with
The Occupy Movement-- Twitter

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and Facebook to
help people realize

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that they shared a common
interest in overturning,

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.030 align:middle line:90%
like, the current structure.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, those
social technologies

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:84%
were not of any use when it
came to kind of developing

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.054 align:middle line:90%
a new, shared power system.

00:42:29.054 --> 00:42:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
social networks--

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:84%
CARTER CLEVELAND:
What do you mean?

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.753 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:42:31.753 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean that,
you know, essentially

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
what happened is that this kind
of authoritarian government

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of reasserted
itself in a vacuum.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, is it possible
that the next evolution

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:84%
of social technologies
and social networks

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.610 align:middle line:84%
could actually take over some
of the function of a kind

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:84%
of ordering society, kind of
governing all the difference

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.950 align:middle line:90%
aspects of society?

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.480 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, even
supplant or displace

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the traditional
functions of government.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that for social
technology to have an impact,

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.461 align:middle line:84%
you need to have the basic
infrastructure in place

00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.559 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a country
that doesn't have

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:07.312 align:middle line:84%
basic infrastructure--
like social technology

00:43:07.312 --> 00:43:11.407 align:middle line:84%
is only once you have
the basics in place.

00:43:11.407 --> 00:43:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're dealing with
just the problems countries

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:84%
deals without infrastructure.
Yeah.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that, like, as social
technology allows more people

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
to be engaged-- I
think, like, in the US

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
we have, in theory, a pretty
good system of keeping

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:90%
government quite minimal.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem right
now is that the interaction

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.130 align:middle line:84%
between government and its
citizens is very inefficient.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like if I can get-- if
I can rally a lot of power

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.860 align:middle line:84%
around my cause, I
can get things done.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it breaks down
because then you have lobbying

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have sort of
special interest groups.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think social
technology is going

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to be reducing a lot of
the barriers to entry

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to the general population
engaging with the government.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
with that is what emerges

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.540 align:middle line:84%
is, like, these extreme
divides of one extreme

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.230 align:middle line:84%
or the other extreme
because that's only way

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:90%
you can rally people together.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I think social
technology is going

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to allow the average citizen
to engage more with government

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and have their
voice being heard.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So I actually don't think that
we need, in the US at least,

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:90%
a major revolution here.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I just think we
need more engagement

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:84%
from the average citizen to be--
so that they'll feel-- they'll

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:84%
be more knowledgeable,
and they'll

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.150 align:middle line:84%
feel more empowered, and more
in touch with their government.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
actually the solution

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of the power--
current, artificial power

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:90%
structures that have emerged.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I actually that's probably
the best solution there.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:90%
So John, what are you thoughts?

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I think social technology
is the current and last

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.420 align:middle line:84%
manifestation of the
emergence of a global brain,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:90%
of a global nervous system.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.510 align:middle line:10%
This is a track that's moving
itself-- that's clearly moving

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.400 align:middle line:10%
itself down toward
the integration

00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:10%
of-- the increasingly closer
integration of minds in people

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:05.330 align:middle line:10%
from all over the world, in ways
that will ultimately-- people

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.320 align:middle line:10%
like Peter Russell
and many others

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:10%
have talked about the
emergence of a global brain.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think social
networking is on the way to,

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:84%
clearly, the latest
kind of aspect of that.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.460 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple
of interesting kind

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:90%
of notions about that.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You raised the possibility
of the government

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and what it has to do
with the government.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, I would argue,
you're on your way

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to a truly
representative government

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:90%
where you represent yourself.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place
downstream-- where our present

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:84%
government's all designed for
somebody to climb on a horse,

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and ride to Washington DC,
and represent them, you know,

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:47.450 align:middle line:84%
from someplace where-- where the
populace can't-- can't go to.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's all-- that's
all going to break down.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:84%
What's also going to happen
with social networking is--

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say your perspective
is distinct from his where he

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.570 align:middle line:84%
doesn't-- he's
sort of suggesting

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that the social networks would
allow for a gentle reformation.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I get from your--
from your perspective

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
is that the inertia of
the-- of the old structure

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.460 align:middle line:84%
requires a deeper level
of transformation.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
I do.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Occupy, for instance,

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and you make a good point, is
that you get an initial kind

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.570 align:middle line:90%
of-- an initial push.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And-- of social networking
allowed that to happen.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the system
built-- breaks that down

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:90%
and pushes that back.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens,
ultimately, is somebody else

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:90%
figures out another to do it.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's WikiLeaks
or some other kind of thing.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And they each get
beat back originally.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, they start
getting smarter and figure out.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And what you're seeing
is the emergence

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of those kind of
capabilities that

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.390 align:middle line:84%
are going offset the kind
of a linear, vertical,

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:90%
vertically oriented aspect--

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So for as Napster
was to Spotify,

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.535 align:middle line:84%
Occupy could be to the next
iteration of that impulse,

00:46:59.535 --> 00:47:00.320 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a gazillion
different people all around who

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.350 align:middle line:84%
are figuring out--
trying to ways-- how

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to work their way
around the NSA and work

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:90%
their way around the whatever.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.600 align:middle line:84%
All of the problems--
the present system

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and the encrusted
linear kind of thing.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:84%
You-- you think the current
system will be overthrown?

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, ultimately--
but overthrow

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean radically.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that what you're
seeing is a accelerating

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:90%
degeneration of the system.

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:90%
An implosion of the system.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Necessarily, it's
bankrupt and it's

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.290 align:middle line:90%
unsustainable at its structure.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:41.520 align:middle line:84%
The basic-- the essential
nature of it is not sustainable.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they keep pushing
money and everything else

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.290 align:middle line:90%
to try and prop it a bit up.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether you look at
the financial system,

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.720 align:middle line:84%
or the geopolitics, or
the scientific system,

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:90%
or energy, or agriculture.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Work your way across it.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Every one of them is embattled.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're all-- there's
all these new ideas that

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.750 align:middle line:84%
are coming in that
are radical new things

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're trying to fight.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They fight them back,
but they're, ultimately--

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.730 align:middle line:90%
you know what you're watching.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole system is
going to degenerate.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.800 align:middle line:90%
A vacuum is going to open it up.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.512 align:middle line:84%
Comes the emergence
of the new world.

00:48:15.512 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit about the,

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, potential that
art plays a major role

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.192 align:middle line:84%
in this shift of values
in this transmutation

00:48:22.192 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:90%
or reformation of society.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
that-- what do you see?

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there a greater value
of art for social change

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.790 align:middle line:84%
than we've seen
up to this point?

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me build you
a theoretical framework

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.700 align:middle line:84%
for thinking about that, which
is really quite interesting,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.220 align:middle line:90%
to me at least.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a lot of
Angelican channelled,

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds of sources,
and you build a synthetic kind

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.720 align:middle line:84%
of framework about how they
say that reality works, what

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.360 align:middle line:90%
they say is, there's just one.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Everything is one.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of
the reality that we

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:84%
hear-- that we experience right
now is like a piece of paper.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's like six
reams of paper.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And each reality is
one on top of another

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and they all exist concurrently.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and so, in fact,
your past lives, for instance,

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:09.640 align:middle line:90%
are all existing right now.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And all your future lives.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is--
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:13.715 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:49:13.715 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And you could bleed
through between the--

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.070 align:middle line:84%
or you can drill down,
if you take that imagery.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that you can
get transmission

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:84%
between the different
kind of aspects.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.520 align:middle line:84%
There is an extraordinary
interesting guy

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.130 align:middle line:84%
named Clif High,
who's got a website

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.900 align:middle line:90%
called halfpasthuman.com.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Works with web bots.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.847 align:middle line:84%
And what he has done is
built an amazing kind

00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:84%
of predictive
capability by sending

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.440 align:middle line:90%
these web bots out on the web.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is that they
look at how language changes.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And they do these
longitudinal cuts.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they-- he's got
a cosmological framework.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at how the language
changes from time to time.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And he sees-- and
the whole premise

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the waves of change,
the major perturbations,

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.520 align:middle line:84%
bleed through and they have
a bow wave, if you will,

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
that come through.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And they show up in
language beforehand.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you can find it,
you can anticipate, by six

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:90%
months or something like that--

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Although I have say, I
enjoyed halfpasthuman,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but it did seem like a lot
his more drastic predictions

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.580 align:middle line:84%
didn't really come
to bring much.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's pretty good.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the mechanics--

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:90%
the specifics of it.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But the-- the
notion is-- and he's

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.210 align:middle line:84%
been right, six
months ahead of time,

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:84%
on 9/11 and some
other kind of thing.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The notion is that you have
this anticipated-- anticipatory

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of function
that flys-- that runs

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.010 align:middle line:90%
its way through the system.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Art, I think, is a
precursor-- and I have friends

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.790 align:middle line:90%
that argue that they can do it.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.410 align:middle line:84%
That they can look
at art and they

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.630 align:middle line:84%
can see through the emergent
art the leading edge

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.750 align:middle line:90%
of where the society is going.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And that, in fact, that if you--
if you know how to read the tea

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.350 align:middle line:84%
leaves, if you will,
that, in fact, you

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.620 align:middle line:84%
can start to see how the
values, and the changes,

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and stuff start to
manifest themselves.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Because artists, to
my way of thinking,

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.050 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are
working their way down

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:32.730 align:middle line:84%
into that ephemeral, soft,
and emergent kind of space

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and trying to put kind
of form to those feelings

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and those ideas that
have not yet emerged.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And so that-- so in some--

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:43.430 align:middle line:84%
-Well, what--
-Yeah.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.129 align:middle line:84%
-What do you think about that?
-Yeah.

00:51:45.129 --> 00:51:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
really, really beautiful

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:49.310 align:middle line:90%
way of thinking about it.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought
about it similarly,

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:84%
but not-- art is like
mankind's tea leaves, you know.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's--
you know, what I always

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:02.370 align:middle line:84%
sort of thought about
was how-- it would

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:03.330 align:middle line:90%
take a lot of art history.

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, how does art
history complement history?

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear about-- you
know, I didn't-- I wasn't there

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.860 align:middle line:90%
for the Vietnam War.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.805 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm told
about Vietnam War,

00:52:15.805 --> 00:52:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and the atrocities,
and the deaths,

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of hit
by these numbers.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this is
clearly a very bad thing.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's this kind of like--
you can't process the numbers

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and convert them into,
like, the reality

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of what it was in any
meaningful, important way.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, then you see The
Vietnam War Memorial in DC.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And it like hits
you really hard.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost addressing
that exact thing

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:46.920 align:middle line:84%
by just focusing on the
names and the sheer number.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that the
Director of The Art Genome

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Project at Artsy got his PH.D.
in art history, and his thesis

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.730 align:middle line:84%
was published, and it was
about art of the Vietnam War.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.484 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the art--
like, for me, just flipping

00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:00.350 align:middle line:84%
through the pictures-- just
looking through the pictures

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:84%
in his book, it was like
kind of hitting me, hitting

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.530 align:middle line:90%
me, hitting me, hitting me.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like different slices.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And like no slice is the direct,
analytical, objective slice

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that says here, are the numbers.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.490 align:middle line:84%
By the numbers,
here's what happened.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Here is, factually,
what happened.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like a
different-- well, here

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is like my emotional reaction
to it as one artist put it.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And another one, here is
my emotional reaction.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get all
these different slices,

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:28.520 align:middle line:84%
you sort of-- you sort of finish
and you're just like, wow.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You like-- and obviously, it'll
never be anything close to what

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:84%
it really was, but
it's so much closer

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:90%
than just having seen the data.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I am very much from
a science background,

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.270 align:middle line:84%
so I'm all about the data, and
about logic, about science,

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and I believe in
it, and I love it.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But it really does, for
me, show the power of art

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:48.264 align:middle line:84%
in communicating, perhaps,
like a deeper truth.

00:53:48.264 --> 00:53:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, beyond communication,
I mean, one thing, I think,

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that I finally fascinating about
Burning Man is that you could

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.450 align:middle line:84%
look at the entire thing as an
art work, or as a sculpture,

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:90%
as like a social sculpture.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the social
sculpture's constructed from,

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:84%
like, a set of game rules
that's given to people.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have game rules in our
society that we all live by

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and we've just forgotten
that there are rules

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.290 align:middle line:90%
that we basically agreed upon.

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of shows that
society itself is actually

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.590 align:middle line:90%
like an art project, you know?

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, could art become, on
an even deeper level, kind

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of like a template for how
we think about social design

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.566 align:middle line:90%
on so many levels, you know?

00:54:20.566 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think Burning
Man is a wonderful example

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:24.780 align:middle line:90%
of the emergence of this.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And just as Carter
suggested, in the same way,

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:30.390 align:middle line:90%
it's just this bow wave.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It's this emergent
kind of notions

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that people are
trying to figure out,

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.820 align:middle line:84%
what is the new way in which
this whole thing could go?

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a wonderful,
wonderful example of that.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And how do you guys feel
about the negative corollary

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.335 align:middle line:84%
of social networks and
social technologies

00:54:47.335 --> 00:54:49.821 align:middle line:84%
as being the kind of
disappearance of a privacy,

00:54:49.821 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I recently saw a futurist
kind of talk about it.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
look, you know,

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.010 align:middle line:90%
privacy is just over basically.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, you might as well
just get used to it.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you feel
that's the case?

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.124 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel that's
necessarily a bad thing?

00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
question that I've

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.780 align:middle line:90%
spent some time thinking about.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that I'd
like to get some money

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.420 align:middle line:84%
run a project at
my institute about

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.860 align:middle line:84%
because there are a
couple of scenarios there.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And one would be that,
in fact, there is a world

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:90%
where there is no privacy.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And somehow humanity
adapts to that,

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:22.050 align:middle line:84%
adopts it, and morphs into
some kind of way in which you

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:84%
maintain some sense of
integrity, personal integrity,

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:29.070 align:middle line:84%
in the face of-- of
extraordinary transparency.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Parenthetically, by the
way, the whole equation

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is backwards because it should
be that the government is

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.020 align:middle line:90%
transparent and the--

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And the individual, the
citizens, have privacy.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- it's the
wrong way around.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Or is privacy-- I mean,
you wouldn't have privacy

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.060 align:middle line:84%
in the same since if you
lived in, like, a tribe

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.030 align:middle line:90%
in the jungle, for instance?

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, everybody was kind of
transparent to each other.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But we don't live in
tribes in jungles anymore.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And so the question is, if you--

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But is privacy itself
a kind of a construction

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:00.381 align:middle line:84%
of a certain type of, you
know, kind of social, you know,

00:56:00.381 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:90%
existence?

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's sort
of where I'm at.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard to really
examine things on a really

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:07.440 align:middle line:90%
abstract level like that.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But I was thinking, on
the subway over here,

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.640 align:middle line:84%
just about the
notion of freedom.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And, like, it is hard
to put it in completely

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.620 align:middle line:90%
analytical, logical terms.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But freedom seems just like
such a fundamental purpose

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and reason to be.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Privacy-- I do wonder if
privacy is sort of this notion

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that we kind of
have as a remnant

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.550 align:middle line:90%
of, like, recent society.

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't really see what's so
fundamental about privacy.

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and I do-- if I had
to-- I wouldn't necessarily

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:45.170 align:middle line:84%
advise policy because I'd
want to think it through more

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and talk to more smart people.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But if I had to kind
of make a gut call,

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say that a world where
everyone knows everything

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:84%
about everyone with
zero privacy is probably

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.830 align:middle line:90%
going to be an awesome world.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But that does go both
ways to the government.

00:56:57.590 --> 00:56:59.331 align:middle line:84%
Let me just-- you
had asked me earlier--

00:56:59.331 --> 00:57:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Doctor, sure.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.750 align:middle line:84%
What the characteristics
of a new human would be.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the characteristics
that people talk about rather

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.510 align:middle line:84%
consistently is the
notion that you'd

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.200 align:middle line:84%
be able to look at somebody,
you could see from their aura

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.780 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
imagery that you get--

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to know
their history,

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:15.880 align:middle line:84%
you know what they're
talking about,

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and you'd know when
they're telling the truth.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.100 align:middle line:84%
You know how they
feel and you know

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.150 align:middle line:90%
if they're telling the truth.

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:24.820 align:middle line:10%
And so again, if that, in fact,
is one of the characteristics

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:10%
of this emergent
new world out here,

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:28.830 align:middle line:10%
then, in fact, you are
going toward a world

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.650 align:middle line:10%
where you have-- now it's not
just privacy of the people

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.470 align:middle line:10%
and not of the
government or whatever.

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It would be universal.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:38.734 align:middle line:84%
So you get rid of advertising,
and you get rid of--

00:57:38.734 --> 00:57:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just
ask you guys one more.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:40.866 align:middle line:90%
We're about to wrap up.

00:57:40.866 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:84%
One more quick
question for you guys.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've seen recently
the successive of Bitcoin

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:47.630 align:middle line:90%
or it's complicated emergence.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is a virtual
currency that's

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:53.100 align:middle line:84%
based on very complex
mathematical equations that

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.610 align:middle line:84%
was developed by an
anonymous mathematician.

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It started out cheap, but
became incredibly expensive.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, it was $230 a Bitcoin.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It dipped a bit.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But what it, in a
way, could suggest

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is the potential for a
currency, a virtual currency,

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that disintermediates people
from the banking system

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:15.810 align:middle line:84%
in the same way kind of
Napster disintermediated people

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.090 align:middle line:90%
from music.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys think that
something like that could

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.111 align:middle line:84%
be part of this transaction?
-Yup.

00:58:21.111 --> 00:58:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It necessarily is.
-It-- it is.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And it will be.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I love everything about Bitcoin.

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:28.860 align:middle line:10%
I love the fact that it makes
me feel like I'm living my life

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.340 align:middle line:10%
in a science fiction movie.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:35.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's just the
algorithms, and the protocol,

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:39.790 align:middle line:10%
and the mathematics is
so beautifully designed.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.300 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going to be
a huge part of everything that

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.416 align:middle line:90%
we're-- we're talking about.

00:58:47.416 --> 00:58:48.207 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:58:48.207 --> 00:58:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you guys so much
for talking with me today.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.606 align:middle line:84%
It was good to get these
different perspectives

00:58:51.606 --> 00:58:56.020 align:middle line:84%
on the future from a
young, tech entrepreneur

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and a somewhat more seasoned--

00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.452 align:middle line:90%
An old geezer.

00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Veteran of futurism.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.064 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to having
you back and talking more.

00:59:03.064 --> 00:59:04.630 align:middle line:84%
-Yes, it was nice to be here.
-Thanks so much for having us.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Thanks so much.

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:14.700 align:middle line:90%
