00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130 align:middle line:84%
-In the New Age
culture of today,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.390 align:middle line:84%
a common idea is that your
thoughts create your reality.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.500 align:middle line:84%
The truth is far
more complicated.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if we
exist in a world

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.220 align:middle line:84%
where a huge amount
of reality has

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.130 align:middle line:90%
already been created for us.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We can't just imagine
or wish it away.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:84%
We can see that a new world view
or a new paradigm is emerging.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
This world view
integrates Western science

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:84%
with the world's
mystical traditions.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience is
learning a great deal

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:84%
about the brain/mind system,
about how our thoughts

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and emotions arise
in the brain, even

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
though the hard problem of
consciousness remains unsolved.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.470 align:middle line:84%
The New Age idea that our
thoughts change our reality

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
might actually be a
foreshadowing of a future state

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
of development where
we're able to integrate

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
extrasensory perception
into our world view.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
At that point, rather than
breaking the laws of science,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
the scientific world
view will have expanded

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%
to include this awareness.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:84%
When we reach that
level, the new age will

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:90%
no longer be a fringe culture.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it'll be the reality
in which everybody now lives.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%

-Hello, folks.

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Mindshift."

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
In today's episode,
we'll be talking

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
to two scholars of the
esoteric traditions

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and Western and Eastern
forms of enlightenment,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Jay Michaelson and
Richard Smoley,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
with Jay joining us first.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So thank you very much
for being here with us.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
ANNOUNCER: Writer and vice
president of social justice

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
programs at the
Arcus Foundation,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Jay Michaelson is one
of the leading voices

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on the complex relationships
between religion,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
contemplative practice,
sexuality, and law.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He's written four
books-- "God vs. Gay:

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The Religious Case
for Equality,"

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
"Everything is God: The Radical
Path of Non-dual Judaism,"

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
"Another Word for Sky:
Poems," and "God in Your Body:

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, Mindfulness, and
Embodied Spiritual Practice."

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
On top of this, he is active
in the LGBT community,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
founding Nehirim, and
fighting for the rights

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:84%
of sexual minorities
in religious groups.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, "Forward" named him
in the list of the top 50

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Most Influential Jews.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.618 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're here on "Mindshift"
with Jay Michaelson.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you, Jay.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And Jay has a new book coming
out, "Evolving Dharma."

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So actually, I had a
little bit of a hand

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
in seeing this book
get out into the world

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
through Evolver Editions
at North Atlantic Books.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about yourself

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and your book, your new book.
-Sure.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
The new book is
about the meditation

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
revolution, pro and con.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
More people are practicing
meditation and mindfulness

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
in America now than
anywhere else on the planet

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:90%
at any time in history.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:10%
And yet it's an opportunity
to really reflect about

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:10%
how mindfulness is
being integrated or not

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:10%
into corporations, into
prisons, into schools,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:10%
into the military, even,
and what that might

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:10%
actually look like in practice.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I also talk about the
shifts in practice that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
can happen in one's own life.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So I talk a little bit
about my own long retreats

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and my own years of
practice and some

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of the dark nights that come
with the good times as well.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any statistics
as to what percentage

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
or how large a population is
exploring these practices?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The best numbers we
have is that one million

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
new Americans--
there are one million

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Americans trying meditation
for the first time each year.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really explosive
growth, and mostly

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%
in the health care context.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think the consensus is
that the next big studies are

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
econometric, not
neuroscientific.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Once we really can quantify
the decrease in health care

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
utilization that comes
from mindfulness practice,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:90%
this thing's ready to explode.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this will become
the financial incentive

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
to have folks do mindfulness
rather than utilize the health

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:90%
care system is enormous.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Are you practicing
mindfulness right now?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm practicing
jokshan right now,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
relaxing in pure awareness
while trying to have

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:90%
a coherent conversation.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And how is the dharma evolving?

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It really is shifting.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
What does "dharma"
mean, actually?

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So the word "dharma"
means "the way,"

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's just how things are.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
uses for me personally

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the
points of practice

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is to see everything
that's happening

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:90%
as dharma and not self.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
This is just this happening.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
This is Daniel Danieling
and Jay Jaying.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And the dharma is
unfolding and rolling on.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's the way things are.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It's everything that is.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, specifically,
refers to the teachings

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha, an Indian prince
from the sixth century BC,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
which later gave
birth to the kind

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
of meditation which is practiced
throughout the country.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, you kind
of question the whole concept

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment and you
note that the Buddha himself

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:90%
never really used that term.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
awakening, right?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So how did we get
to enlightenment

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and what does it mean today?

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as the
dharma progressed out

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
of the monastery, it
became a religion.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:90%
It became a religious system.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.925 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the
associations of meditation

00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
with spirituality
come from that.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Really, I think
meditation is like a form

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:90%
of contemplative fitness.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing you do.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a thing that
changes the brain.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
mechanistic, actually,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and naturalistic
in its orientation.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that
enlightenment should be somehow

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
spooky and mysterious and
it's unattainable really

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
run afoul of what the
Buddha himself said,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.764 align:middle line:84%
which is that all
of us can do it.

00:05:18.764 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You can do it.
I can do it.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
movement now called

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
the practical dharma
movement, which actually

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of helps people along.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't become
fully enlightened,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
but I've gotten to one of
the traditional milestones

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Which is?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, four of these
in the theravadan Buddhist

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%
tradition, which I practice.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm three quarters
diluted still.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
What is the milestone
that you hit?

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
The milestone's
called stream entry.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You enter the stream
of the dharma.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's very common.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went on a
three month retreat,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and you get past these ordinary
steps through the practice.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is so
liberating about that

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is it can actually give
you a map of where to go.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.195 align:middle line:90%
The map's not territory.

00:05:58.195 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:90%
The recipe is not the meal.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
to do the practice.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
more rationalistic,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
practical approach
to the dharma for me

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
has been absolutely
life-changing.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
How would we measure
contemplative fitness?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you look at in
terms of brain states,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
like alpha states
and stuff like that?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.613 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
two ways, really--

00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
behaviorally and
neuroscientifically.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can measure behavior
change-- how stressed are you

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
right now, versus
how stressed where

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
you before you
started meditating

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Or immune response-- how fast
your body heals from disease.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And all this has been really
extensively documented.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
The neuroscientific piece,
like what's actually happening

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, I think, the
science is a little bit--

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:90%
just a little younger.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't have quite the
level of analytical richness

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:90%
around some of the data.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And so critics have called
it the new phrenology,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
like measuring the
bumps on a head to see

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:90%
what your personality is.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
bit better than that.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of brain states

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.107 align:middle line:84%
which correlate with increased
mindfulness practice.

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And those have been
measured in the lab.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.485 align:middle line:84%
And I've been wired
up to EEGs and put

00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:90%
in an MRI and stuff like that.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:90%
They've measured my brain too.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And what is that if you
were at the optimal state?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Would it be more alpha
waves or beta waves?

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different-- some of it

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
has to do with decrease in
different regions of the brain,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
in different parts of the brain.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's less about more
alpha, less alpha, and more

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
about which regions of the brain
are being activated by stimuli.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you can interrupt
the stimulus response,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:90%
loop in different places.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's where a
lot of the focus it.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the
stuff on brain waves

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
has to do with state
rather than stage.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And states are cool.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:90%
They're great.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have both had a
lot of interesting experiences

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
with different mind states.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:90%
But they don't transform.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't liberate
in the same way

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that really shifting the brain
and upgrading the brain does.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
One thing you
brought up in the book

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is this idea that, could one
be enlightened and yet still be

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:84%
quite fallible in human terms,
potentially sex obsessed, drug

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
addicted, or fascinated by
all sorts of distractions,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and be what goes under
the term "enlightened."

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
your thoughts are there?

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's
happened historically.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the shadow sides
of the dharma in the West

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
has been the meeting of
Western libertinism with a very

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
authoritarian, traditional
structure from Japan

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
in particular, because
mostly Zen masters who

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.937 align:middle line:84%
have received their
certificates of enlightenment,

00:08:14.937 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of nice.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.403 align:middle line:90%
You get a certificate.

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
You can frame it and
put it on your wall,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
but then go on to
abuse alcohol or abuse

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
their students, female
and male students,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in very exploitative
sexual ways.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about, I think we

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of
Judeo-Christian frame

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:90%
that that's somehow sinful.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's actually just about
exploiting people and making

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.813 align:middle line:84%
people's lives
really unhappy when

00:08:36.813 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
what you're meant to
be doing, of course,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:90%
is reducing suffering.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually
happened historically.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it just seems clear that
there are different axes

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:90%
of human development.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
There's an ethical
axis and there's

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual or
contemplative axis,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can be very
advanced in one,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:90%
but still an emotional infant.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It calls to mind some of
the ideas of Slavoj Zizek,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that interesting
political post-Marxist

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.601 align:middle line:90%
critic who believes that--

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Not what I thought you were
going to pull out right now.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.199 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how,
in his perspective,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Asiatic New Age
thought has actually

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
become the dominant, underlying
paradigm of postmodern

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
capitalism, because it
allows people to continue

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to participate in a
system that they know

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.985 align:middle line:84%
is destructive and
mechanistic yet feel

00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
a kind of inner sense of
non-attachment or detachment

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think where the rubber
hits the road is like, well,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:90%
how is it actually playing out?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are certainly
narcissistic Buddhist and Hindu

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and yoga practitioners
out there.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
There's also a whole movement
called Engaged Buddhism.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And my view is that a lot of
the negative, narcissistic stuff

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that has come with
spirituality is really

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
a function of the Boomer
generation more than anything

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
else, frankly.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of the younger
practitioners who I know

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
tend to be actually very
highly socially engaged.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Personally-- you asked
about my biography earlier.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
maybe is different about me

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.665 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other folks who
are doing this kind of practice

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%
is that I have a day job.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm a professional activist and
I work for an LGBT foundation

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and we do a lot of work
all around the world.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.526 align:middle line:84%
And right after
this conversation,

00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:14.225 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go have
another meeting about Russia

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and the situation there.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's actually
more common among a younger

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%
generation of practitioners.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And how do you feel when we
look at potentially the largest

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
crisis humanity faces being
the ecological crisis,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel that these
types of contemplative fitness

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
practices intersect with
level of structural problems

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that our post-industrial
civilization has unleashed?

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the question is, where's
the level of the problem?

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It clearly does not
intersect in a meaningful way

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
in changing and fixing the
deep structures of society.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But on another scale, it does
work on an individual level,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I think, in my experience.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
What are all these
technologies of amusement

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:90%
and distraction for?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're for
amusement and distraction,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to kind of be not satisfied
with what there is,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
but actually, well, I have that
thing over there, if I do this

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.717 align:middle line:84%
or if I can have
this activity or I

00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
can buy this bigger house
or something like that,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll feel better.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So at a very basic level,
the worst case scenario,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
if your practice doesn't lead
to liberation and enlightenment,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
at least there's,
like, one less jerk

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
in the world who is able to
live a little bit more lightly.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is kind
of the worst case scenario.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
You can go up from
there to really see

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
the operations of greed,
hatred, and delusion

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:90%
in every aspect of our life.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
You talked in
the book about how

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
one way to look at it is
that in the '50s and '60s,

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the dharma in the
Western context

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
was in a kind of
infantile state, then

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
became into like
a childlike state.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And now it's in a kind
of adolescent state.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
What do you think that
means in terms of what

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:90%
would be the adult state?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I think for me-- who knows,
predicting the future.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think adulthood
and maturity would

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
be a somewhat more rational,
almost dispassionate

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the power
and the dangers of some

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of these practices,
seeing these practices

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
as technologies,
as tools which can

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:90%
be used for good, also for ill.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
You can practice concentration
and become a better warrior.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a really
interesting question.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
There's still a notion of
adolescent experimentation,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I think, in this
phase of the dharma's

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:90%
progression and evolution.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
don't even yet know,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.987 align:middle line:84%
"we" being the larger culture,
some of what's out there.

00:12:25.987 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Are these altered
states which you

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
can get into through
concentration practice

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:90%
that are really incredible.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:10%
And I've entered a
lot of cool states.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But these things really
take the cake, I mean,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
just surrounded and bathed
by universal life and love.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And two days later,
you're still a jerk.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's really
a powerful lesson in what

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.897 align:middle line:90%
changes us and what doesn't.

00:12:45.897 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So the future of
the dharma would

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
be non-jerky enlightenment.
-I hope so.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be right back
with Richard Smoley.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
ANNOUNCER: Ever
since he was a child,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Richard Smoley has held a
fascination for the spiritual,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to the point where a great
aunt of his, who happened

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to be a nun, told them he was
maybe thinking a little too

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:90%
much about religion.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:10%
This didn't deter him,
however, and he went out

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:10%
to study at Harvard,
where he worked

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:10%
on the university's
literary magazines,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:10%
the "Harvard Advocate."

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
From there, he went
on to study at Oxford,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
where he edited "The
Pelican," and most

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
importantly, was introduced
to the philosophies

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Kabbalah.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, he released
his first book,

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
"Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to
the Western Inner Traditions."

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Since then, he's written
"The Essential Nostradamus,"

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
"Conscious Love: Insights from
Mystical Christianity," "Inner

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Christianity: A Guide to the
Esoteric Tradition," "Forbidden

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Faith: the Secret
History of Agnosticism,"

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and "The Dice Game of
Shiva: How Consciousness

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Creates the Universe."

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
He is considered one of the
world's foremost authorities

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
on mystical and
esoteric teachings

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.765 align:middle line:90%
of Western civilization.

00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Really happy you
could join us today.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about who is Richard Smoley.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, I ended up as a writer
on the mystical and spiritual

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:10%
traditions, mostly of the West.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And that came about,
oh, about 25 years ago,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the middle
a career shift in my life.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, why
not write about subjects

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:90%
that I found were of interest?

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So I started writing
to various magazines

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:90%
that were around in those days.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Were you already practicing
some kind of mystical bent?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:90%
What was your particular bent?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started out
working with Kabbalah,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
which is a Jewish
tradition, but this

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:90%
was in a non-Jewish context.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a small group at Oxford
University, strangely enough.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I found this group
quite by accident

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
at the freshman's fair,
various activities

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And I became drawn to it.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the group
for a couple of years

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and am still in touch
with many of the people

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:90%
who were connected with it.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But that was the beginning
of my spiritual voyage.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I moved to San
Francisco in 1980.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I started
working with things

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
like a course in miracles,
which is a channel text,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
allegedly by Jesus
Christ, and whether do

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.835 align:middle line:84%
you believe that or not, it's
still a very powerful text.

00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe it?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
There would be no way of
proving it one way or the other.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But if it were typed
out by a bunch of chimps

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
on keyboards in a
room, it would still

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
be a profound spiritual text.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And how did you get
introduced to theosophy?

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:90%
They hired me for a job.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I had been in this
field for a long time,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and they contacted me
about eight years ago

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to start editing Quest
Books, which is the imprint

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Theosophical Society.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk a little
more about what theosophy is.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
That was going to
be-- what is theosophy

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:90%
and why is it still interesting?

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, theosophy is
a movement started

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
by a Russian mystic
named H.P. Blovotsky

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:90%
in the late 19th century.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Theosophical Society was
founded by Blovotsky and others

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
in 1875 in the West
40s in New York.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's become one of the most
influential spiritual groups

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in the last 100 years, even
though no one has heard of it.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And one thing it did--
it did many things.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But one thing it did was
promote a lot of Eastern ideas

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of Eastern concepts
in the West, some of which

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:90%
are pretty much mainstream now.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Karma-- many people
know what karma is.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It was a totally esoteric
idea 100 years ago.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And Blovotsky claimed that she
was given a lot of information

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:90%
by hidden masters--

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:90%
No one knows who they were.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people claimed they
were completely fraudulent

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.382 align:middle line:84%
and that she made
the whole thing up.

00:16:58.382 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
quite that simple.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.185 align:middle line:90%
I don't think she made it up.

00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I think they were real.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
lot of hagiography done

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:90%
around her and around them.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think the core
of the story is true.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
And their ideas and
teachings became part of what

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:90%
became known as theosophy.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of its ideas became
very, very influential.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
One-- I'm not a
vegetarian myself,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but the theosophists
were among the first

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to promote vegetarianism in
a really big way in the West.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was still very
outre when they did.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And the theosophists
were also very active

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
at a very early stage in
promoting Indian independence.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The Theosophical Society
moved to India in 1878.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And very soon after it became
active in, little by little,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
pushing India
toward independence

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:90%
from the British Raj.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And Annie Bessett, who
was one of the presidents

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Theosophical Society,
was very influential

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and influenced Gandhi.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
She thought Gandhi was a
little too confrontational.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But she was definitely
part of that movement.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.925 align:middle line:84%
And so theosophy is-- as
little known as it is-- there

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
are 3,300 members in the US.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
As little-known as it
is, it's been quite

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:90%
powerful, very influential.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a
few of your titles.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:84%
One of your books is
"Inner Christianity."

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about what that book's about?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, it's about the
esoteric and mystical side

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity, that is
to say beyond the dogma

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the theology, a
lot of which is pretty hollow.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is Christianity
as a form of inner experience

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and as a guide to
inner experience.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:90%
What is the kingdom of heaven?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:90%
What is the kingdom of heaven?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all told about in parable.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It's never really overtly said.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of heaven is
within you, not by the way,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
among you, as many modern
translations would have it.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is, I would
say, it's that in you

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
which says I. There's
something in you that says I.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus would call it atman.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can go in,
and you can never

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
see this I, right, because
it's always going to be,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
what's seeing?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So Saint Francis of
Assisi said, what you're

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
looking for is what is looking.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And inner Christianity
is about that.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about the different
states of experience,

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
about the different
levels of consciousness

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and how these are symbolized
in Christianity and the Bible.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Those things were not meant to
be taken literally originally.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a church father
named Origin who said,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
in the third century,
"who is so stupid

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
as to think God planted
a garden somewhere

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:90%
in the East like some farmer?"

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
No, these actually point
to certain mysteries.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he went on to
say, even the Gospels

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
aren't entirely historical.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
They also have an
esoteric meaning.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And have we found out now?

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, we found out that
there was no garden of Eden,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things Jesus supposedly
said and did, he didn't do.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
There's an esoteric
meaning to it.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
This was never
completely lost, but it

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:90%
has been very heavily buried.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.721 align:middle line:84%
I guess you explore
this in another book

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:90%
you wrote about gnosticism.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So inner Christianity-- in terms
of Western esoteric tradition

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
over the last few centuries,
I've studied a lot of Rudolf

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Steiner more than theosophists.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's a sense
where Steiner would argue

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that despite, in some ways,
Christianity seeming maybe

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to our modern perspective,
a little aggressive compared

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to Buddhism or the
contemplative practices,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:84%
the contemplative fitness that
Jay discusses, that there's

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:84%
some core Christianity which is
still an evolutionary necessity

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
or an advance over previous
spiritual traditions, in a way.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
that in any sense?

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big fan of Steiner's,
just because I find his writing

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
kind of boring and
his ideas are sort of

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
a little cumbersome
for me, but he was

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
obviously a profound thinker.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It does point out one
of the differences

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that people often
point to in Western

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:90%
versus Eastern traditions.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The Western traditions of let's
say Judaism and Christianity

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of
simplicity, say something

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
or attempt to say something
about the redemption

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, the world
is somehow in a broken state

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be
fixed or redeemed.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And particularly--

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Reparation, right?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that the word in Kabbalah?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's tikun in Kabbalah.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And Eastern religions
are often criticized,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
rightly or wrongly, for
being more about being

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:90%
detached from the world.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Kind of fatalistic, in
a sense, in that world

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
is just going to
go on like this.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The individual human
has an opportunity

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.385 align:middle line:84%
to get off the
wheel, but otherwise

00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:90%
the wheel just keeps on going.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I think you can be very
simplistic in saying one

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
is right and the other isn't.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I certainly in some ways feel
more personally sympathetic

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
with the Eastern point of
view, because sometimes--

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:90%
just as emotional--

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What about the whole
discovery or the kind of

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
thought stream in
the movement of

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:90%
the technological singularity?

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've you
look into Ray Kurzweil at all,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the technology-- in a way,
it's like the eschatology

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and teleology of this
kind of Christian mindset

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
has somehow shifted into the
realm of engineering, this idea

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be able
to merge with machines,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
reach a kind of a
mortal condition,

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
overcome all the constraints
of human beingness

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:90%
through nanobots or so on.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Have you looked into that at
all or given that some thought?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
As for thinking our
computers will do that for us.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I haven't looked
at it very much.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of the general model.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just viscerally
very, very suspicious

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of something that's
going to posit

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
technology as our salvation.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Because technology has been
a rather unreliable savior

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:46.101 align:middle line:84%
ever since the first steam
mill in 1770s England

00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
was put together.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Life is in many ways better for
us than it was in those days.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
a lot of problems.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And to say, well,
there's a singularity

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come where
all the technology is going

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to converge and rescue
us from ourselves

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.015 align:middle line:90%
strikes me as very dubious.

00:24:08.015 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.004 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a about
another book of yours

00:24:13.004 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:84%
which I read recently
and really enjoyed,

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:90%
was "The Dice Game of Shiva."

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you kind of compress
that hypothesis a bit for us?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the subtitle of the
book is "How Consciousness

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Creates the Universe."

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I do in it, which
I think is unusual and rare

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
is I actually come up with a
definition of consciousness

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.284 align:middle line:90%
that's not completely circular.

00:24:37.284 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can find
this in the dictionary.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:90%
What's consciousness?

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's awareness.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
What's awareness?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's perception.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:90%
What's perception?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's consciousness.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
The wheel goes on.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
The way I'm presenting
it is that consciousness

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
is the capacity to
relate self and other.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense in some way or
another of a self and an other

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that entails consciousness,
or consciousness entails.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a me here.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.360 align:middle line:90%
There's a you there.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:90%
That's very kind of--

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:09.702 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
There's an I that's
experiencing something.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a presence or a witness
that's experiencing something.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And that I put it together
into a person that I call you,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
may be kind of a secondary
structuring of experience.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's still this I that
perceives something in response

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:90%
to something.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And my argument in the
book is that, well,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
consciousness this way,

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
you could see it as
underlying all the universe.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
That is to say-- and Edison
said this in a 1890 interview

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
with Harper's Magazine.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
He said all of these molecules
that interact with each other

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.556 align:middle line:84%
in all these sorts
of ways, do you

00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
mean to say they do this without
some kind of consciousness?

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And to say that they
have introspective

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:84%
consciousness like a
Woody Allen character,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:90%
no, they obviously don't.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But there is some capacity
to recognize and respond even

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in kind of very basic things.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And our consciousness
is just a very

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
narrow bandwidth of
what is obviously

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
an enormous continuum.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So do your ideas
correlate with maybe

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Frieda Capra's ideas
in the Tao of physics

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:90%
or Amit Goswami's work in a way?

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I suppose so.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Amit's sort of big on quantum
theory and quantum activism

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing about quantum is that
as Heisenberg or somebody said,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:84%
if you think you
understand quantum theory,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.762 align:middle line:90%
you don't understand it.

00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Since I don't think
I understand it,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether this
means I understand it or not,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
but I'm pretty sure I
don't understand it.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
In any case, I personally am
not that excited or interested

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
in using the quantum metaphor
particularly, although I don't

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
have any problem with
someone who knows

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:90%
more about it than I do doing.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, if consciousness
kind of underlies reality

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
in some sense, is
it possible then

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to think of there being kind
of like a purpose or a telos

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.810 align:middle line:90%
to existence?

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what Amit
Goswami draws on,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Aurobindo's ideas that somehow
consciousness is using material

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and biology, matter in life,
to create more and more

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated and
subtle representations

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of itself that can
actually operate

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in more domains dimensions.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Does that suggest that
maybe consciousness wants

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:90%
to take another big upgrade?

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that idea also comes
back to theosophy, which started

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
evolution of consciousness

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:90%
in the late 19th century.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was extended by
people like Teilhard

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
de Chardin in the 20th.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess the first answer
that comes to my mind

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is the quote from the Rig
Veda-- "What is all this?

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Where it all come from?

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Only the highest
god in heaven knows.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Or what if he doesn't know?"

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.580 align:middle line:90%
That was written 1200 BC.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:90%
We're still in that situation.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
All of these things, to my
mind, are interesting ideas

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate and work with.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a point at which

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
you just have to say, yeah, it
could be, and leave it at that.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
If the mind fixes on
a definite answer,

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a little god.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:90%
It becomes an idol.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And as the spiritual teacher
G.I. Gurdjieff once so

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:84%
wisely said, "sooner or
later it all ends in people

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
breaking one another's heads."

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, you would

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.671 align:middle line:84%
say that knowledge keeps
evolving and advancing also,

00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more in
different dimensions.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even with
Jay, he was talking

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:84%
about knowledge of how
contemplative practices really

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:90%
impact the brain.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
That's new information.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, of
course, the historians

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.890 align:middle line:84%
talk about the whig
view of history,

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:90%
which is one of progress.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And is that another
version of that?

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I personally see progress as a
very dynamic and fluid thing.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that are advancing

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and there are things
that are regressing.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Our capacity to control
the natural world

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is certainly greater than
it was 100 years ago.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Our sense of integration
and connection

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
with the natural
world is much feebler

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.035 align:middle line:84%
probably than it's
been any civilization

00:29:39.035 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever heard of.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
That could also
be a transition.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Like the guy Owen Barfield
talked about a transition

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:84%
from the original
participation of people

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
in aboriginal cultures to
having to go through a passage

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of separation and alienation,
so there would be another form

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of participation that he
called final participation,

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
which would be a
consciously kind

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:90%
of comprehended whole in a way.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you a bit about
the history of the New Age,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because obviously theosophy
was at the dawn of that.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And you you've written very
interesting-- in your new book

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The Supernatural" you talk about
your intellectual relationship

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to the New Age in a way and
how you see that history.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate on
that a little bit?

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:28.403 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could say the New
Age started in 1757, which

00:30:28.403 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:90%
is a rather odd year to pick.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was the year that
the Swedish visionary

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Emanuel Swedenborg said was
the year of the Last Judgment.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And Swedenborg said, this is
not going to happen on Earth.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:84%
No one on Earth is
going to be aware of it.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
He described it as a kind
of spiritual housecleaning

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote these enormous,
and often extremely tedious

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
volumes explicating the Bible
and his visions and so on.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:84%
These were incredibly
influential

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:90%
in the 19th century.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
That would be a whole
subject in itself.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I bring it up is
that a Swedenborgian minister

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
named Warren Felt
Evans in 1863 published

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:84%
a book called "The New
Age and its Messenger."

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was really the
first time to my knowledge

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that the New Age was used
in that kind of sense.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So Swedenborg kind of
kicked this idea open.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things he said was

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.805 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the old religious
forms are going to be discarded

00:31:32.805 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's going to
be a new, shall we say,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.805 align:middle line:84%
porousness between
the spiritual world,

00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the visible world-- the
visible and invisible worlds.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And this idea seeped
into our culture

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.843 align:middle line:84%
and is very much
part of our milieu.

00:31:50.843 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Evans was a disciple of
another man named Quimby, who

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
came up with the
idea that you could

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.035 align:middle line:90%
heal yourself by your thoughts.

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Though power is
what healed people.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just
change people's minds.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.371 align:middle line:90%
He was a New England doctor.

00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in those days
could call themselves

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:90%
a doctor if they wanted.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And he was a great healer.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.770 align:middle line:84%
People came to
him from all over.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And his ideas were
incredibly powerful.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Mary Baker Eddy, founder
of Christian Science,

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:90%
is one of his disciples.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And this became a thing
called New Thought, which

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that your
mind affects reality,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can change reality
just by your thinking

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is one of the key ideas of
the New Thought movement--

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Which brings us to "The
Secret" today and what

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:90%
we know and so on.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, "The Secret" in 2006.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Every decade there's
a new bestseller,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:90%
marketing this particular idea.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra, the laws
of spiritual success.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And what would
be your critique?

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at
that idea from a more

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.390 align:middle line:90%
empirical perspective?

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.770 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I'd say a couple of things.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
One, to be rather mystical
about it for a minute,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say that there
is a level of the mind,

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, where
to think something

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.050 align:middle line:90%
it literally to make it happen.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:90%


00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I also think this
level of the mind,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
which I'm saying we all
have, is very, very,

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:84%
very, very heavily defended.
Why?

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because think of your thoughts
of the last two minutes.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you want every
one of those things

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:90%
to become palpable reality?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, yeah,
there's a level of the mind

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
that really can create reality.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:84%
What's your reason for
believing that that's the case?

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:90%
One or two little experiences.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
I would say also

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is that even at a more
mundane level, yeah,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts do create reality.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But our thoughts are
also very confused

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and very contradictory.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So in order to have
the mental focus

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to actually affect reality
through your thoughts

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.246 align:middle line:90%
is no small thing.

00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
And we do create the
world with our thoughts,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
in a literal sense.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Our thoughts are confused.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Our world is confused.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts are a
mixture of good and evil,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:90%
if you want to use those terms.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The world is a mixture
of good and evil.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
that confusion, how

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:43.139 align:middle line:84%
do you see New Age
constructs around aliens,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:47.830 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials,
ancient aliens, Atlantis,

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE], all the stuff?

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, each of those is a
big topic in its own right.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
With aliens and
extraterrestrials,

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:01.775 align:middle line:84%
in 1957 C.G. Jung wrote a little
essay called "Flying Saucers"

00:35:01.775 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in which he said-- he talked
about the psychological

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:90%
implications, came down to it.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:90%
People are seeing something.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really the
very far past that now.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
He also thought that those
saucers represented a shift

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:90%
in the nature of the psyche.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of the coming
to consciousness

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
or coming to
self-realization of humanity.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in also a
somewhat literal sense.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something fell down
a neighborhood in Norfolk,

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Virginia a couple of
weeks ago and everybody

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.206 align:middle line:90%
was pulled out of the area.

00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:90%
The g-men came in.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.800 align:middle line:84%
They hauled this
mysterious thing away.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
ended up ruling

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.160 align:middle line:90%
that it was a weather balloon.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:90%
It's always a weather balloon.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book about
UFOs a couple years ago

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:84%
which had interviews or
articles with the heads

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Belgian and
Brazilian air forces,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
who are not, at least
ostensibly, crackpots.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said, our guys
are seeing something.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We wish the Americans would
tell us what's going on.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
something there.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the government
knows something.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it doesn't.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.590 align:middle line:84%
95% of UFO sightings
are weather balloons.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:90%
They're clouds.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:90%
They're satellites.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the 5% that aren't
that are very weird.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis-- there's
no reason Atlantis--

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the story of Atlantis
could not be true,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and many reasons that
it could be true.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:84%
According to Plato, whose
dialogues, the Timaeus

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and the Kritias are
the first discussions

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, how
literally played

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] is a subject.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Plato, who said,

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:84%
this is from the Egyptians
who kept records.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Atlanta sank in 9600 BC.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, hey, that was just around
the end of the last Ice Age.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know that at the
end of the last Ice Age,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of land that had
been formally above sea level

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:90%
that was now under sea level.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's no scientific
reason to believe

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that a civilization like
Atlantis couldn't have existed.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And it fits in well with
perfectly conventional science.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether Atlantic
had all of these--

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.455 align:middle line:84%
whether it was kind of like--
sometimes it's portrayed

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:84%
as almost like something
in a 1938 science

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.090 align:middle line:90%
fiction movie or something--

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:84%
There's the hypothesis that has
been developed that there was

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.830 align:middle line:84%
more contact with
extraterrestrial civilizations,

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:84%
energy devices, or
types of technologies

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that were being used.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.122 align:middle line:90%
That could be.

00:37:57.122 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It is possible-- and this is the
thing that strikes me as most

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.890 align:middle line:84%
likely if you want to use words
like this in this context--

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that the story of Atlantis
is a story of a civilization

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:84%
achieved a fairly
high level of capacity

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in, shall we say,
the thought power we

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.730 align:middle line:90%
were just talking about.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Technologically, it may
have been very primitive.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:10%
So if you dug up Atlantis,
you wouldn't necessarily find

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:10%
huge Greek temples underwater.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.380 align:middle line:90%
You might not notice anything.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But it could be that they had
these very, very high levels

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of psychic development,
as is sometimes said,

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and that they destroyed
themselves with it.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a Amazonian
shamanic culture that

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
potentially has these
psychic capacities

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
but exists on a very
low material level.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand it in some
Native American traditions,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.520 align:middle line:84%
there are legends
of civilizations

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
on these continents
that destroyed

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.110 align:middle line:90%
each other through sorcery.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So then ultimately, I guess,
when we get to the New Age,

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
for you that's maybe just
a rubric or a way of making

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.457 align:middle line:84%
a general statement
or whatever around all

00:39:17.457 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
these different
phenomena that are

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:84%
still at the edge of the
contemporary world view,

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.891 align:middle line:84%
or a little beyond our
capacity to fully access.

00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of them are ways
of stretching our imagination.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And the literal truth of a lot
of them, you can argue about.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
to be said about making

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
the human mind
contemplate possibilities

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that it normally doesn't.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We normally just see
what's ahead of us--

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the bills, the
family, the mortgage,

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:90%
the job are the only reality.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these New Age
visions are ways of saying,

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
this is just part
of the picture.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.170 align:middle line:84%
This is just part
of the picture.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you think, taking
that as a keynote, what

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:84%
you think America's going to be
like in, say, 50 or 100 years?

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.385 align:middle line:84%
What kind of development
are we going to see?

00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll narrow the
time frame a little bit.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I would say this.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The next 10 years-- if I'm
going to make prophecies,

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else does,
so why shouldn't I?

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You wrote the book
on Nostradamus.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't believe
his prophecies.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:90%
That's another story.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the US the next 10
years will be an age of reform,

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the age of
reform around the turn

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't happen, the
10 years after that I believe

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:90%
will be an age of blood.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, I cannot say.
But I mean--

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:90%
When does the dancing start?

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe after the age of blood.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:90%
But there's huge dislocations.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.210 align:middle line:90%
There are huge injustices.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:84%
There are huge
problems in society.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And the society is
basically at an impasse.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Something has to give, and if
something doesn't give gently

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:19.430 align:middle line:84%
now, the next five to
10 years, if, shall we

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:84%
say, if we don't take a little
bit more from the 1%, well,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:84%
in Russia the 1%
just wouldn't give.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So 100 years ago,
they killed them all

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
or drove them out
of the country.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Didn't make things
better in the long run.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.560 align:middle line:90%
But that was a thing.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:90%
It was a dam that finally burst.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself wondering if
that's not what we're seeing

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:90%
in the next 10, 20 years.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And how does what you've
learned and studied through all

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
your esoteric
scholarship and so on

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.450 align:middle line:84%
influence your view of what our
capacities are for the future?

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the capacities that we
have to develop most urgently

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and most critically
are ethical capacities.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
is just nothing

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
more than ordinary common
sense and human decency,

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
such that I would
imagine most, if not

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.750 align:middle line:84%
everyone here in this
audience would agree on.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're locked into
this competitiveness, this view

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not ahead unless
I step on someone else.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And this has gotten
so out of control

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and the society is so
hypnotized by it that that

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.550 align:middle line:90%
has to be the next step.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm certainly
all for mindfulness

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:10%
and meditation and
expanding consciousness

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.640 align:middle line:10%
in a cognitive sense.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But the real urgency
is an ethical sense.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that's about
our time for today,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and I really appreciate
you being here with us

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and thank you so
much for sharing

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.670 align:middle line:90%
your voluminous knowledge.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.534 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:07.534 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck back
here with "Mindshift"

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.130 align:middle line:10%
with Jay Michaelson
and Richard Smoley.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to
this conversation.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Kind of promised myself
I would, in the future,

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.090 align:middle line:84%
do few all white, Western
men panel discussions,

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.470 align:middle line:84%
but here we are nonetheless,
so let's just roll with it.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk
about these devotional,

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Western theocratic traditions.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Why at this point
would anybody who's

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:84%
more interested in
evolutionary spirituality,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
or evolutionary
consciousness even

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:84%
take them seriously or consider
them as a meaningful path?

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Well that's a good question.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:10%
I would say that from a
personal point of view,

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:10%
God or the divine is probably
not ultimately personal.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that would
be just too small

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.625 align:middle line:84%
a God to create everything
that we know about

00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
we don't know about.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.980 align:middle line:84%
But in this infinite
capacity of the divine

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
it, brahman, it has the capacity

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to relate to us
personally, because we're

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:90%
out of this as persons.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:90%
We exist as persons.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize that's not
entirely what a Buddhist would

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:84%
say, because a
Buddhist would say

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that the person is an illusion.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But we experience
ourselves as persons.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And the divine can relate to
us in a personal sort of way

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
out of its, shall we
say, infinite capacity

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.490 align:middle line:90%
for action and variety.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.400 align:middle line:90%
That may not be ultimately true.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it isn't
ultimately true,

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but that potentiality
is within it.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think it's
almost a form of hedonism.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.480 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the variety

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of contemplative
experiences that I

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.940 align:middle line:90%
find incredibly appealing.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And like Lou Reed said,
"some kinds of love,

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:90%
the possibilities are endless."

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:84%
For me to miss one would
seem to be groundless.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:10%
And whether it's cutting off
an indigenous, polytheistic,

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.460 align:middle line:10%
shamanically inflected
form of consciousness,

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.970 align:middle line:10%
or cutting off a
contemplative consciousness

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:27.780 align:middle line:10%
or cutting off a theistic one
feels like feels like a loss.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could ask
the same question of,

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.171 align:middle line:84%
why deal with poetry when
we have plenty of prose?

00:45:33.171 --> 00:45:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:38.114 align:middle line:84%
So another question
that Richard raised

00:45:38.114 --> 00:45:39.280 align:middle line:84%
was this whole idea
of mindfulness,

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
which we were discussing
in our previous talk,

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and whether that could actually
be used against us, almost

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to turn people into more
productive and consumptive

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.290 align:middle line:84%
units of a society
that's ultimately

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:90%
a little bit soulless.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.183 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious if that's
something you ever thought.

00:45:54.183 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I actually talked to
Jon Kabat Zinn, who's

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:84%
probably the leading
popularizer of mindfulness

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.030 align:middle line:90%
about exactly that.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had taught
mindfulness at Goldman Sachs

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and did actually
say, I think you're

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
kind of missing the point.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're really
doing your practice,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you need to see the
consequences of your actions

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and you need to own
it and not deny it.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's
absolutely the case

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that this technology is a
kind of transparent one.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the traditional
wrapper, it's

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:84%
always been together
with virtuous conduct

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and ethical reflection.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always been
a notion that you can't just

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.680 align:middle line:84%
have the contemplative
practice, but that there

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.970 align:middle line:84%
has to be something
else with it,

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.360 align:middle line:90%
the relational and the ethical.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I guess it reminds
me how in the Amazon,

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.220 align:middle line:84%
we've taken the
idea of the shaman

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and we've made into a
construction of the healer

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.510 align:middle line:90%
and the positive visionary.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But actually,
throughout the Amazon,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.300 align:middle line:84%
people who gain higher
levels of knowledge

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:90%
are also more dangerous.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The boundary between
sorcerer and shaman

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:57.811 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a loose
one, in a way.

00:46:57.811 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other thing that
these traditions always teach

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.070 align:middle line:84%
is that greater
levels of capacity

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:84%
incur greater levels
of responsibility.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And if one is not
accompanied by the other,

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:84%
then something is going to
go wrong, because then you

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%
end up manipulating people to
do whatever you want them to do.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great deal of
concern about black magic,

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
saying like the fundamentalist
Christian community.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But as we all know, mass media
and advertising and marketing

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:35.140 align:middle line:84%
are forms of black magic
that are much more pervasive

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.010 align:middle line:84%
than some guy drawing
an upside down

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:90%
pentagram in his little studio.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I like the way you said,
as we all know there.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I think we know that.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.740 align:middle line:84%
There's this notion I started
out-- before getting serious

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.550 align:middle line:84%
about my Buddhist
dharma practice,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I started out in the
Jewish mystical tradition.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a fair amount of
scholarly work in that field.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of notion there,

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of conceptions of
preparatory practices,

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
like what do you
have to do first?

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the summary of
it is you need to be grounded.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be in
relationship with other people.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you can get very
ungrounded and we've seen

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.410 align:middle line:90%
that actually happen.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's that separation
of these different strands,

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:90%
just like you pointed out.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.320 align:middle line:84%
The shaman isn't just a healer
who visits other realms.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The shaman's also integrated
into a communal structure,

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.140 align:middle line:84%
a societal structure and
a cosmological structure.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the joys of being

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.220 align:middle line:84%
in our postmodern
contemplative marketplace

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:90%
is we can pick and choose.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, we do
that at out peril also.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you guys
a little bit about a subject

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that's of great interest to me,
as you might imagine, prophecy

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and what your perspective
is from your studies

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and so on in thinking about
what is the place of prophecy?

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:90%
What's the utility of it?

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And did you find any
value in the prophecies

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
around the end of
the Mayan calendar,

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.596 align:middle line:84%
that we just passed through that
threshold over the last year

00:48:54.596 --> 00:48:55.816 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:48:55.816 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:84%
One thing I found very
interesting about it is that,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:03.180 align:middle line:84%
at least many forms
of it, took somewhat

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.970 align:middle line:84%
a Christian, apocalyptic,
Judeo-Christian

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:08.930 align:middle line:90%
apocalyptic form.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And this has certainly been
going on for 2000 years.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Practically every
year in the last 2000

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.030 align:middle line:84%
is predicted to be the end
of the world by somebody.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:19.950 align:middle line:84%
But what was
interesting about this--

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you want to say
about the 2012 phenomenon,

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that, to some degree, the Judeo
Christian apocalyptic habit

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
was suddenly brought
in to justify

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.660 align:middle line:84%
or be justified by
a native tradition

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that's non-Judeo-Christian.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, it shows that the
Judeo-Christian mindset

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.860 align:middle line:90%
is losing its grip.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the only
reason that I say that.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
one lesson one can

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:90%
draw from the 2012 phenomenon.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that's right,
and at the same time,

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
there's something almost endemic
to the human condition that

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.410 align:middle line:84%
leads us toward millennialism,
that leads us to have this view

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's the end of
the world as we know it,

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:90%
whether we feel fine or not.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did some
graduate work on a false Messiah

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in the 18th century, who kind
of predicted again that the end

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:90%
of the world is nigh.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to just
be a recurring pattern.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:84%
What I found fascinating
about the 2012 phenomenon

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.180 align:middle line:84%
was that it was true,
exactly as you said.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Outside of the
traditional frames,

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.700 align:middle line:84%
these patterns of thought get
replicated, as they sometimes

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.140 align:middle line:84%
do in radical Islam,
as they sometimes

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.050 align:middle line:84%
do in hypercapitalism,
as they do in fascism,

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and as they do in socialism.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.240 align:middle line:84%
This messianic impulse or
this millennial impulse

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.300 align:middle line:84%
seems to be one which exists
even in secular contexts.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So if 2012
represented an aspect

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.241 align:middle line:84%
of this millennial
consciousness,

00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:84%
which is very natural to
humans, because we're projecting

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.691 align:middle line:84%
our own individual fate
on the fate of the cosmos,

00:50:56.691 --> 00:50:58.090 align:middle line:84%
or on the fate of the
world, what you guys

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:90%
think happens after we die?

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:90%
I think something goes on.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There are three possibilities--
nothing goes on,

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
you go onto a state
of reality that's

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.610 align:middle line:84%
either better or
worse than this one,

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.840 align:middle line:90%
or you come back here again.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
possibilities.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have atheism/
agnosticism,

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:28.010 align:middle line:84%
you have the traditional
Abrahamic or at any rate

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Christian and Islamic
view of one life,

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and then the third is a more
Eastern view of reincarnation.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.160 align:middle line:90%
My own view is quite simple.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.280 align:middle line:84%
What if all of
those are possible?

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.280 align:middle line:84%
What if, for whatever reason, in
your life in your own evolution

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.720 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it that,
maybe you need to come back.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you go on.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of
addressed very well

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:84%
in that-- I thought
it was very good film

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.140 align:middle line:90%
called "Offending your Life."

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.700 align:middle line:90%
It came out, like, 20 years ago.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.135 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is, like,
does this guy have to go back

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:04.430 align:middle line:90%
or has he graduated to going on?

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought there was a
lot of wisdom in that.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I have almost no idea.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I think for me--

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Even after all your studies
and work in Kabbalah?

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you what
Kabbalists think about it.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But you asked what
I think about it.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I think to me the most
persuasive account

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:22.180 align:middle line:84%
is to really even
question what the self

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:90%
is, in a sort of Buddhist way.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about the
way that reincarnation was

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:29.665 align:middle line:84%
interpreted in some
Buddhist understandings,

00:52:29.665 --> 00:52:32.780 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like when
a cue ball hits a bunch

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.260 align:middle line:90%
of other balls on a pool table.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So there is something about that
cue ball that's been preserved,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.050 align:middle line:84%
the momentum and the direction
and all those kinds of forces.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it's not
the cue ball itself.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.840 align:middle line:84%
The cue ball was this vessel
or this body that was around

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:84%
for some period of
time that created all

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:90%
these forces, karma, whatever.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And those do seem to have
an impact in the world.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.800 align:middle line:84%
That's about as far
as I'm willing to go.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, I assume it's over.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It raises the question of
what, for me, is just about

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the most mysterious
thing in the universe,

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:90%
which is causation itself.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Western
philosophic tradition,

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.010 align:middle line:84%
in case people didn't know
this, causation is like totally

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.860 align:middle line:90%
mysterious and inexplicable.

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Causation had been
permitted to survive

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.280 align:middle line:84%
as a concept in
philosophy because,

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.910 align:middle line:84%
like the British monarchy,
it had been erroneously

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:24.130 align:middle line:90%
believed to do no harm.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's right or not,
it just shows how problematic--

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.720 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
exactly by causation?

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Just drill in a
little second there.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, what actually
makes something a cause

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and what makes
something an effect?

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Eastern view, which
we categorize somewhat crudely

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:47.340 align:middle line:84%
as karma, posits
that a given cause

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.570 align:middle line:90%
produces an effect like itself.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.640 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, a good cause
produces a good effect.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
A bad cause produces
a bad effect.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Western science
is a little more--

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.514 align:middle line:84%
Until you would
attain some type

00:54:01.514 --> 00:54:02.980 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment, in
which case that doesn't

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:03.890 align:middle line:90%
really function anymore.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:84%
You're just done
making effects.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:07.910 align:middle line:90%
You're finished with that.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a going out of a
candle, is the metaphor

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.450 align:middle line:90%
that's actually used.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is really kind of a
mystery of why actually-- we

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.550 align:middle line:84%
take it obviously completely for
granted that the laws of nature

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:20.280 align:middle line:84%
are what they are and
causes lead to effects.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.220 align:middle line:84%
That's like Rupert
Sheldrake had the whole idea

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that the laws of nature are more
like patterns or habits that

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:90%
become more coherent over time.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But actually they could
always be changed.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It is remarkable
that even what we

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.240 align:middle line:84%
think of as the
laws of our being

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.990 align:middle line:90%
seem to be subject to change.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And what is your perspective?

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of Western
esotericism-- Kabbalah,

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity,
gnosticism--

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.660 align:middle line:84%
what do you see the future
is for these traditions?

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you people will still be
practicing in the same way

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.390 align:middle line:90%
in 20 or 50 years?

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I think one thing that's
interesting in contemporary

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.680 align:middle line:84%
mysticism, mystical practice,
is that it's heavily influenced

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
by a certain kind of
psychedelic experience, which

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.200 align:middle line:84%
is a unit of psychedelic
experience such as the ones

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that are available
on LSD and mushrooms

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and similar substances.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Non-substance based.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:15.110 align:middle line:84%
There's an experience
that a lot of folks had,

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:84%
using these medicines,
of oceanic consciousness

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.390 align:middle line:90%
or something unit of like that.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they
looked for and found

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.570 align:middle line:84%
echoes of that with mystical
and contemplative traditions.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I think what's shifting now
is as different medicines are

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.970 align:middle line:84%
becoming better known,
different kinds of experiences

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.740 align:middle line:84%
are becoming better known--
visionary experiences.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.470 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned prophecy earlier.

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And correspondingly, there
seems to be an increase in some

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of the more gnostic and
the more esoteric elements

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Western
contemplative traditions,

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.720 align:middle line:84%
which have more to do
with visionary experience

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and more to do with
complexity rather than unity.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
actually a really

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
interesting shift,
and one that's just

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.390 align:middle line:90%
beginning to filter through.

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was a
20th century Russian

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Orthodox saint who
said, Christianity

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.340 align:middle line:90%
still in its infancy.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And this may sound very
mysterious, because it looks as

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.840 align:middle line:84%
if the Christian
institutions are caving in,

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.840 align:middle line:84%
which in many ways
they deserve to do.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
values of Christianity

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and the core values of
the other world religions

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.220 align:middle line:84%
are very much like it, are still
very much in their infancy.

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:84%
As we saw a couple weeks ago,
the pope made an announcement,

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:24.430 align:middle line:90%
who am I to judge gay people?

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And you literally
saw the headlines--

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.590 align:middle line:84%
"Pope Acts Like Christian--
World in Shock."

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's a long way to
go even with very basic

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:40.620 align:middle line:84%
ethical principles and practices
that we all pay lip service to,

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.780 align:middle line:84%
but the world still isn't
taking too seriously.

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.590 align:middle line:84%
What about in terms
of-- in the New Age

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:49.090 align:middle line:84%
culture over the
last 40 years, we've

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:56.160 align:middle line:84%
seen an eruption of alternative
worldviews, models and so on.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.530 align:middle line:84%
What's your perspective
on the value of that

00:56:58.530 --> 00:56:59.930 align:middle line:90%
or where that may go.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it actually a useful
stream that's going

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.930 align:middle line:90%
to influence the mainstream?

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It does and it has.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Karma and reincarnation were
two very, very esoteric ideas.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I worked for the
Theosophical Society,

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and theosophy introduced
that into the Western world

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.010 align:middle line:90%
in the late 19th century.

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been given
some good backing

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:27.830 align:middle line:84%
by Ian Stevenson's work,
right, where reincarnation

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and biology intersect.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Didn't he find many,
many past life,

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.550 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous past life
recall in early childhood,

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.430 align:middle line:84%
where these children
would remember exactly

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:38.530 align:middle line:90%
who they'd been in a past life.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And he even traced them back,
take them to those villages

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and find correlations
and correspondences.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.410 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:48.430 align:middle line:90%
That's all interesting.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But reincarnation is
now, as far as polls say,

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.740 align:middle line:84%
believed in by 21% to
28% of the US populace.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:01.720 align:middle line:84%
There was one thing that said
25% of American Catholics

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:90%
believe in reincarnation.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:06.240 align:middle line:10%
So this is very much part
of the mainstream now,

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.030 align:middle line:10%
and it's not going to go away.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe a
little more prosaic,

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.910 align:middle line:84%
but I think equally
powerful, has

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:16.550 align:middle line:84%
been the pragmatic orientation
of some of the New Age stuff.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:17.720 align:middle line:90%
So, does it work?

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:90%
What does it lead to?

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.800 align:middle line:10%
What's the experience?

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.390 align:middle line:10%
So at its extreme,
that again collapses

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.910 align:middle line:10%
into a kind of narcissism,
what does it do for me?

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think in a more
interesting and reflective

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.640 align:middle line:84%
vein, it really
puts us back, puts

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.140 align:middle line:84%
the experiencer
and the experience

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.360 align:middle line:90%
back into the center.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And if traditional religious
containers aren't delivering

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the goods, whether it's
spiritual or ethical

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.934 align:middle line:84%
or whatever else,
they're not durable.

00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:41.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to last.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that shift,
that shift to pragmatism,

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.340 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful one.
-Awesome.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Listen, thank you so much.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.633 align:middle line:84%
I think we've run out
of time for today,

00:58:48.633 --> 00:58:49.950 align:middle line:84%
but it was great to
have you, and look

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:53.001 align:middle line:84%
forward to more conversations
and discursions in the future.

00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:54.270 align:middle line:84%
-It's a pleasure.
-Thank you.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
