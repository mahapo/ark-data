00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Hi folks, thanks for tuning
in to "Mind Shift" today.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.380 align:middle line:10%
Today we're welcoming
Russell Brand to our show.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
In the last decades, trust
has completely evaporated

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.440 align:middle line:90%
from our public life.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Nobody believes the word of
politicians, corporate leaders,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:90%
bankers, religious figures.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They've basically all been
exposed as total frauds.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:84%
When we think about this
corruption of our civic life,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I think public
artists are stepping

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
into a crucial
political function.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who has a
million of followers

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
on Twitter or Facebook, they can
speak directly to their fans.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They can create their own
media, build their own network,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and spread all
kinds of new ideas.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have artists like Russell
Brand-- and also Eve Ensler,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
who is with us today-- are
kind of at the cutting edge

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
of culture right now.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They have the opportunity to
change the operating system

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
of our culture, by focusing a
collective attention on what

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:84%
they believe is
important, and what needs

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:90%
to be done for the future.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:19.608 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Hello everybody.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:10%
Today we're on GaiamTV's "Mind
Shift," where we'll be speaking

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:10%
about the upcoming political,
social, spiritual, sexual

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:10%
revolution, with
a strong proponent

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:10%
and advocate of transformation.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is our special
guest, Russell Brand.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
He's a comedian, a
writer, an actor,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
touring the world
with his one man show,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
"the Messiah Complex."

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So please welcome
him here, thank you.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Born in Essex
England, Russell Brand

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is an acclaimed comedian,
actor, and author.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
His movie credits include
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:84%
"Get Him to the Greek,"
and "Despicable Me."

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And his memoir, "My Booky
Wook," sold over 600,000 copies

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
He is currently on a sold
out world tour of his one man

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.858 align:middle line:90%
show, "the Messiah Complex."

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
You're here.
Russell Brand.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness and
happening of body, hey?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.735 align:middle line:90%
That's currently what I am.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Nice, how is that
feeling these days?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel all right, I mean,
I'm not yet ready to become

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:90%
a disembodied consciousness.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.947 align:middle line:84%
Although, we don't
truly understand

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:90%
the nature of consciousness.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps a little bit of my
consciousness is, in fact,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:10%
disembodied.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:90%
We don't fully know yet.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw you recently
disembody the consciousness

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:90%
of some MSNBC anchor people.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I was doing that-- I love.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Did they take it with the
full merit of compassion

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:90%
with which it was engendered?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, Daniel, I just
remember being there, thinking,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
these people are not affording
me the most basic courtesies.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And I found that amusing.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about revolution.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So you recently
contacted me to do

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
a little writing
about revolution

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
as a subject that's
on your mind.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts about it?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Do we need one?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Outer, political?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Inner, spiritual?
-All of those.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.625 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
That's too succinct, isn't it?
Cause the--

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
you so succinct.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
---the dynamic of the show
must be conversational.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
If I like, think [INAUDIBLE]
I'm gonna just try and answer

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
in binary-- 0111000111.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.081 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
yeah-- and I think

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:90%
that it has to be all of them.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's you, in fact, that turned
me on to that Buckminster

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Fuller fella.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.412 align:middle line:84%
And their egos,
[INAUDIBLE] that you

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
got to look at the whole
thing, the whole reality,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
the maximum positive
impact for 100% of humanity

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.584 align:middle line:84%
without ecological damage,
as soon as possible.

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
So how are we going to do that?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone's
got to be really nice.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.731 align:middle line:90%
I think start off with that.

00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I suppose what's happened is--
this is what I believe in,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.329 align:middle line:90%
mate.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Is that certain
cultural narratives

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
are promoted that are
beneficial only to elites.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
These cultural
narratives are not true.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to realign the cultural
narratives that we promote.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So if there are-- the only
reality that is relevant is,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:90%
we have this planet.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
There are this many
people on the planet.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
There are these resources.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Any system that is in conflict
with the even distribution

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
of the resources to the people
is a disingenuous and illusory

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
All these things are just ideas.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
America, just an idea.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:90%
England, just an idea.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Karate, just an idea.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Wednesday, just an idea.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
What about reptilian
overlord aliens?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.905 align:middle line:90%
Definite real thing.

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:30.114 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the ol'
reptilian overlord aliens.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
On some level, they are
just a sort of a frequency,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
a vibration, I guess.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I try not to worry too much
about the reptilian overlords,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
because-- in case
they are watching--

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to get a part
time job in the Illuminati,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
on the weekends.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
What do you see your
role with the Illuminati,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.376 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of work would
you like to do with them?

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I basically just like to do
massage for the Illuminati.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Just keep the Illuminati
upper echelons

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
relaxed when they're
having those conferences,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:90%
with their hoods up.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
No, I think for me, mate, I
think that all we have to do

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is not worry too
much about that.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
That's just iconography
and narrative data.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The important data is
imperceptible to us,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
as you know, cause the loads
of this stuff I got off of you.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm
telling you back.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, [INAUDIBLE] you
talk about America.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there-- because the realm
of the senses is so limited.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We can only see between infrared
light and ultraviolet light.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
We can only hear a
limited decibel range.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We think reality is
what we can apportion

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
through the limited
instruments of the senses,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but reality is of
course far beyond that.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.441 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual data, we don't
have the correct instruments

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to receive it.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And we live primarily in
the realm of the senses.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:90%
We live in the unevolved part.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've finally
got you talking again.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.575 align:middle line:90%
There you go, I'm off now, man.

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
One-word answers are
fucked off, ain't they?

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Right, so we live
in a-- when you

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
talk about-- see,
in Christian myth,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
these ideas are quite evident.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the resur--
what Campbell said-- what

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is the relevance of the
resurrection of Christ,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
some guy 2000 years ago,
if we are not constantly

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
resurrected into the moment.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Into the moment and you.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I think what Christianity
is referring to,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
with this resurrection myth,
is that the dead human ape

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:90%
has fulfilled its potential.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
The dead human ape
has not evolved

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:90%
for the last 10,000 years.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
These are the achievements
of the dead human ape.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we must transform,
become enlightened,

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
so that we can access the
next realm of consciousness

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:90%
necessary for evolution.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Right, which also involves
sharing the resources

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
equitably, so the whole planet
can partake in the abundance

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that's available on this--

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
We've gotta let go of
temporary, transient ideas

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%
like individualism.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
The nature of monotheistic
faiths, these dead desert

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
religions, is to
encode us with the idea

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that individualism is more
important than paganism.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Ideologies that integrally
relate us to the Earth.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So that we know that
we are integrity,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
indefatigably related
to our environment,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and we live in the service
of our environment,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
because self is a
temporal illusion.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So how do we make that jump,
in tangible and practical terms?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Well some people like you
just got off to the jungle

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.486 align:middle line:90%
and eat a bunch of plants.

00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
People like me have to think,
have to use the old [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
have to give the
noggin a floggin.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.862 align:middle line:84%
I just think and meditate on the
name-- the holy names of God.

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.554 align:middle line:90%
So that's been helping me out.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
those holy names?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Krishna.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Satnam, the nickname
of God, they say.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.655 align:middle line:10%
But it can be the lords prayer,
like Joseph Campbell-- who

00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:10%
I love loads--
says, all religions

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:10%
are true in that the
metaphor is true.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor is
true, that we are

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
all one, that there is a system
for attaining this oneness.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
scripture [INAUDIBLE] --

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.447 align:middle line:84%
You ever hear of this
guy, Slavoj Zizek?

00:07:31.447 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
RUSSELL BRAND: Yeah,
I've heard of that Zizek.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Zizek.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.505 align:middle line:84%
You know he has that
whole idea that--

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
He's a trouble-maker.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
He's a rabble-rouser.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
---New Age, Asiatic
thought, has become

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the underlying
ideology of postmodern,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.810 align:middle line:90%
post-industrial capitalism.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Cause it allows people to
participate in the system

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that's still about
domination and aggression,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.597 align:middle line:84%
while having this inner
sense of detachment.

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think that's right.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that that's
a particularly new thing.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.611 align:middle line:84%
These ideas rose up at the
time of that Madame Bovary,

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
In a time of young
mysticism-- it

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
normally happens
every time a bit

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
of fin de siecle
terror kicks in.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.675 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do
now is to recognize

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that these spiritual principles
have political ramifications--

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:90%
AKA socialism.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So these things have to be
materialized and politicized.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's no good me,
for being sat around covered

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
in daft tattoos about Jesus
and Buddha, and then going off

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and wanking in the
back of a limo.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Although that's exactly what
I'm doing when I leave here.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
these principles

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
need to be materialized.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Initially, materialized
in the new--

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
So that's the question
again, is what do you seek?

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be--
there's always that gap.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
We see the enlightenment
realized state that we'd

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:90%
like everybody to be in.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
mess, this quandary

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So how do we make those
little bridging steps?

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We make-- I think we obtain
it within ourselves, initially,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and we communicate these
ideas on a personal level.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality-- I can get,
as you've just heard,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I can be very verbose and
loquacious on the topic.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But really, it
just means be nice.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:90%
It ain't hard.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Just be nice.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
You meet a homeless
person, be nice.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You get into a cab,
be nice to the person.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't see yourself
as adversarial.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Then the revolution
has already occurred.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
People fear
Armageddon, don't they?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
People fear the
apocalypse, don't they?

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
But for some, Armageddon
has already occurred.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The homeless people
that walk our streets

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
live already in a
post-apocalyptic world.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Armageddon will surely
come for each of us.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Our own personal Armageddon,
when each of us die.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it redundant, whether
everyone simultaneously dies,

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
if each of us will
individually die regardless.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Armageddon is coming.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So whilst these
cataclysmic principles

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:90%
apply on the individual level--

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Although, there
are people who think

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
we might be able to
extend the human lifespans

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.956 align:middle line:84%
with biotechnology, merging
with machines and live forever.

00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, that's
all cool, man.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is,
is that what we have to do

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is individually reach our
own personal alignment.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
We have to do-- the
principles are all there.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.425 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The principles
are already there.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
We achieve detachment
through meditation.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
We no longer-- once we live.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Once we can achieve
enlightenment.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And once we put our satisfaction
beyond our individual needs,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:84%
we are no longer malleable
by the pre-existing system.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.201 align:middle line:84%
The system requires us to be
selfish little consumerist

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:90%
pods.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.633 align:middle line:84%
Once we go, aw, hey, I'm
not [INAUDIBLE] about that.

00:10:05.633 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for me, because
I've been famous now.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.231 align:middle line:84%
I know that's boring.
I've been rich now.

00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I know that's boring.
I [BLEEP] loads of people now.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.571 align:middle line:84%
I know that's boring.
I took loads of drugs now.

00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I know that's boring.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So all that's left is
spiritual enlightenment.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.267 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's left.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
What's the political dimension
of love and sexuality?

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:90%
What is what, mate?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
What's the political dimension
of love and sexuality?

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
I'm the man to ask,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
because my previous-- in that
area-- is nothing that good.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't
ask Charles Manson

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:90%
how to run neighbourhood watch.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.424 align:middle line:84%
Oh, just let 'em
get into the hills.

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Are you trying to-- is that
an area where you're trying to

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
up your game?

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm upping it.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, I've got to realize
that I'm not a person

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
who can live in will or desire.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I have to learn to
live-- look only

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:90%
within myself for happiness.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I can't let this guy
run the show anymore.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:90%
He's had a good innings.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
What do you see
your trajectory now?

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Here you have this massive
fame, this huge following.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:90%
You're a huge public artist.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
How do you then use
that for these goals

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
that you're discussing?

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Someone told me ages
ago, and I should

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:90%
have just listened to him then.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I met this swami, I goes,
should I become a monk?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%
He went, pfft, no.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Like he didn't want
me in the monk gang.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Like he said, you'll ruin
it for the rest of us.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
He goes, use what
you have for God.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Dedicate yourself to God.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
worry about God-- just

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
means higher thing,
difficult for us

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend and ascertain
with our limited sensory realm.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Cannot understand
the ocean of reality

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:90%
in the teacup of the mind.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Probably roomy, probably roomy.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.087 align:middle line:84%
So what I think is,
if there's something

00:11:42.087 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
you're good at, doing
jokes or whatever,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
do them jokes for God.
You know?

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
What's your best evidence
for the existence of God?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Ah, well, I feel
like-- sometimes I

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
feel the gentle, playful
spirit of God in nature.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel it
within myself, in quiet.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
For me, I remember, it's
a difficult concept.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:90%
For me it is life.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It is consciousness.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness itself is God.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You cannot allow
consciousness to become

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
refracted into an abstract
idea such as individualism.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Individualism is a material,
sensorial, biological notion,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
which we can conquer through
the expansion of consciousness.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Why live on this dimension?

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Why live only on this
frequency once we

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:90%
know other frequencies exist?

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:10%
We have a obligation, for
the evolution of our species,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:10%
to continue to pioneer.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:10%
This is the country
of the pioneer.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.231 align:middle line:84%
So do you feel that you're in
the running to be a messiah?

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Yep!

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Only the true messiah
would deny he's messiah.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Nah, I ain't bothered.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be what
I am and that's that.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.294 align:middle line:84%
Cause once it goes in
other people's brains,

00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
they can do what the
[BLEEP] they like with it.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be
doing what I'm doing.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
-Nice one, nice one.
-But I'm ready.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Hey, well, let's bring
Eve Ensler on, have

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:90%
a brief three-way dialogue.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
-We having a three-way?
-Yeah--

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew this day would come.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.546 align:middle line:90%
---yeah, we have a three-way.

00:12:58.546 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Author of
"The Vagina Monologues,"

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:10%
Eve Ensler is an American
playwright, performer,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:10%
feminist, and activist.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:10%
Her current book, "In
the Body of the World,"

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:10%
has been regarded as
an unforgettable, raw,

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:10%
and powerful story by the
New York Times book review.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
She is the creator of V-Day,
a global activist movement

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:90%
to stop violence against women.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.905 align:middle line:84%
The movement to date has
raised over $80 million

00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and has funded over 12,000
community-based anti-violence

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
programs and safe houses, in
the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, South

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Dakota, Egypt, and
Iraq, providing

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
women sanctuary from
abuse, genital mutilation,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:90%
and honor killing.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
She was born in New
York City, and in 1999,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
was awarded the
Guggenheim Fellowship

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:90%
award in playwriting.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.843 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.843 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Well this is fun for me.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I get to introduce two
extremely extraordinary

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:90%
human beings to each other.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.877 align:middle line:84%
Eve, meet Russell.
Russell, Eve.

00:13:51.877 --> 00:13:53.412 align:middle line:84%
-Hi.
-Hello!

00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:54.744 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:13:54.744 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:90%
So happy to meet you.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to meet you too.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:90%
No, really?

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.083 align:middle line:84%
So nice and kind,
and a bit sexy.

00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
Aw, thanks.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:10%
So we were talking
beforehand about, well,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:10%
cultural programming, which we
kind of discussed a little bit.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, and how,
in a way, we could

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.019 align:middle line:84%
use cultural engineering to
bring about a transformation.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.085 align:middle line:90%
Which I guess you've been doing.

00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:15.518 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to tell
Russell a little bit

00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:16.771 align:middle line:90%
about your perspective on that.

00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I like what you
were talking about,

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the
individualism thing

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:90%
and the consumerism thing.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:10%
And beginning to see ourselves
as artists and the creators

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:10%
of our destiny.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:10%
I think so much of
what is happening

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:10%
is the creating of this passive
culture, where people are just

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:10%
staring up at a screen
or being-- just consuming

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:10%
and transacting.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to seeing
themselves as transformers

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
of their own destiny.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just really am
interested now in all the ways

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
we create energetic shifts
in helping people become

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:90%
transformers of the world.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you were
saying about being nice.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:90%
How do we generate kindness?

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we generate
images of kindness?

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And the possibility of kindness?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So much of the
culture that exists

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
is about perpetrating cynical
ideas of who human beings are.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Particularly television.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:10%
Because I see that Darwin--
"Origin of Species"-- survival

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:10%
of the fittest and all that.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And Social Darwinism,
those ideas that

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:10%
were leapt upon a century ago.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
In that actual book,
"Origin of Species,"

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.421 align:middle line:84%
it kept going, but most animals,
they're a lovely, cuddly bunch.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.027 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
being nice to each other.

00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They [BLEEP] that
bit off, cause they

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.193 align:middle line:90%
wanted a convenient message.

00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
It was the bulk of the book.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The survival of the species
was only a tiny little bit

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:90%
of the book, you know?

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So they just look
for information

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.897 align:middle line:84%
that conveniently conveys a
preexisting narrative, then

00:15:36.897 --> 00:15:38.163 align:middle line:84%
bombard us with that
narrative till we

00:15:38.163 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
can't think nothing else.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.261 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Not very nice.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And what if we just
started saying that people--

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
another Terence McKenna thing--
he says this really interesting

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
thing about the fall, right?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.032 align:middle line:84%
That the whole idea of the
fall, that people are fallen.

00:15:51.032 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Who made that up?

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we're rising.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we're not fallen.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But that just keeps
everybody in their place,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
believing they're
fallen people, you know?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we actually
pulled out from that thinking,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.151 align:middle line:84%
and saw or just really re-framed
who we are, and re-conceived

00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, actually, we're rising
people, not falling people.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
That we can create--
and I love what

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
you said about the evolution
of the next consciousness.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
That we're just here to
push up to the next place

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:90%
that we need to go, you know.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.671 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, but tell me
more on how-- Russell,

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:90%
how can we accomplish that?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.224 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned socialism before.

00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of
curious, do you think

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that the next phase
of human society

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
resembles a kind
of socialist model?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
essays is Oscar

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.914 align:middle line:84%
Wilde's essay on socialism.
-I ain't read that.

00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you gotta read it.
I'll send it to you.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, so he argues that
basically the artist has been

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:90%
the exemplary human individual.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Has shown how individuality
can really flourish.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But often artists in the
past were ones who had

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
independent means, or wealth.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
They had the time to really
cultivate themselves,

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:90%
which most people don't have.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And that you would actually
need something like socialism

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
so that everybody had
their ability to cultivate

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:90%
their own unique individuality.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
You know socialism got a
bad rap in your country,

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
because the whole communism
and McCarthyism and whatnot.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But Communism only
means sharing.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You tell children to do it.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:90%
And the other thing is--

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
---the other thing is
that people go, ah,

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
but what about Russia, though?

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:90%
That weren't very nice.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:90%
They did a Gulag.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Or what about China?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Little girls-- foot binding?

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And things like that.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not-- that's added after.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
With my iPod-- iPad-- I use it
a lot to look at pornography.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
That ain't Steve Jobs'
[BLEEP] fault. It's up to me

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:90%
what you do with a system.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
If a system,
deployed correctly--

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.081 align:middle line:84%
---can create a great deal
of social benevolence.

00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
My guess is she would
have a potentially

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
negative perspective around
the whole pornographic complex.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.505 align:middle line:90%
We know the V is bad.

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I like more talking
about the systems, though.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, you're
absolutely right.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, who gets hold
of socialistic concepts

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
determines what happens
with them, right?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, even Marx said
that communism would never

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
work in a developing country.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
That it would only work
in a first-world country

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
like the US.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It would almost be like, if
there was a financial cratering

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:84%
in the US or the UK, it would
be our first opportunity

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to see if that model
actually happened.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:84%
There's been a massive,
great big financial cratering.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose the
reason this idea needs

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to be derided and attacked
so vociferously is because

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.034 align:middle line:84%
of its potential applicability.
-Absolutely.

00:18:32.034 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's the reason
that the people have to go,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.201 align:middle line:84%
don't ever do
communism, will you.

00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, cause then we'd have to
give up all of our money.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and you
have to share it.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.347 align:middle line:84%
And spread it around,
so everybody lives well.

00:18:41.347 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, Oscar
Wilde said that we

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
have to get rid of
private property,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:84%
ultimately for the
sake of the rich.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:90%
RUSSELL BRAND: Aw, all my stuff.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, because it creates
all these attachments.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
How would you feel if you did
have to give up all this stuff?

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Initially, a bit annoyed,
but ultimately grateful.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.282 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:55.282 --> 00:18:58.384 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone-- cause I
think things confuse people.

00:18:58.384 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you,
but when I go to the store

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and I look at all the choices,
I just get really freaked out.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to buy.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
stores in countries

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that don't have so many choices,
you go in, you get salt,

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.679 align:middle line:84%
and you buy the salt. And
they're done with salt.

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:12.045 align:middle line:84%
You don't have-- you
don't spend your day

00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:90%
thinking about which salt.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.183 align:middle line:84%
But obviously most of
the countries in the world

00:19:14.183 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
are dying to achieve the
level of affluence and comfort

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that we've attained
in the US, right?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So how do you talk
to those people?

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
That would be maybe a job for
artists, as cultural engineers,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to kind of talk to the
people of the world

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and suggest that
there's another step.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.621 align:middle line:84%
Beyond just material
accumulation.

00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Or what do you think?

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I suppose we need to
popularize different ideas.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The reason that I
dress in this way,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the reason I regard material
positions as valuable,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
is because my entire
life I've been

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
subject to messages
that told me that this

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:90%
was precisely the truth.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
That myself-- that
they generate,

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
initially, a sense
of fear and a sense

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.725 align:middle line:90%
of absence within the self.

00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
A sense of fear and
absence, which needs

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.365 align:middle line:90%
to be fulfilled and addressed.

00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They then tell you that
the solution to this fear

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:90%
is to engage in consumerism.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:10%
And to raise your
self-esteem, comparatively,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:10%
through symbols in the media.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:10%
This is what will
make you happy.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.907 align:middle line:84%
This is what will
make you happy.

00:20:02.907 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
You know that the
products used to be

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:90%
sold on the basis of utility.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:90%
You have feet, you need shoes.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Then after the brilliant and
evil Edward Bernays, nephew

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of Freud, said that the way
they used to sell people

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.684 align:middle line:84%
is on the basis of--
not of utility and need,

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:84%
but on the basis it will
make them feel better.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Then the way that the
products became marketed was,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
buy these shoes,
you will feel cool.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a significant
difference, because otherwise,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
once people owned shoes,
they've got shoes.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Once people own a
washing machine,

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:90%
they've got a washing machine.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:10%
We need to be trapped in
a cycle of fear and need,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:10%
so that we remain
docile and malleable.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:10%
Now obviously I have not
managed to avoid this system.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely a product of it.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But I recognize that
these things-- scarf,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
wonderful that it is.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Shoes, very jazzy, very sexy.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Trinkets and items,
temporarily beguiling.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:90%
They are ultimately meaningless.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:90%
We all know this.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We already know everything.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The last words of the Bhagavad
Gita are, "I remember."

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:90%
We already know everything.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think we just have to
popularize a different message.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:90%
People are ready now.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.159 align:middle line:84%
Luckily we're in a situation
where most people are pretty

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
[BLEEP] pissed
off of everything.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is time for transition.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I also think connected to
that is, what makes you happy

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and what is enough?

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
What makes you happy
and what is enough.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people don't
ask themselves that question.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I spent the summer
in southern Italy,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.594 align:middle line:90%
where people have enough.

00:21:23.594 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a lot,
but they have enough.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:10%
And they're actually
really happy.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:10%
And the pleasures are
such different pleasures.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:90%
They're, like, moon-bathing.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're dancing at night.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're setting
out incredible lanterns

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:84%
into the sky and people
dance under them.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's pleasure-- it's
deep pleasure that's rooted

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
in the country, in the land.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of it
is, we don't even know

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
what gives us pleasure anymore.
We don't.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We're so busy consuming
and getting the next thing.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.869 align:middle line:84%
Do you really like that
idea of moon-bathing?

00:21:50.869 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I did like moon-bathing
as a concept.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Moon-bathing is amazing.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.781 align:middle line:84%
-We're all in the moon--
-No--

00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:57.526 align:middle line:84%
---bathing.
---moonbathing is amazing.

00:21:57.526 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
-I bet it is amazing.
-No, it is.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I bet it's better
than "X-Factor,"

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.322 align:middle line:90%
after you get used to it.

00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:02.294 align:middle line:90%
It is, yeah.

00:22:02.294 --> 00:22:04.292 align:middle line:84%
After thinking, uh, has
the moon got a relative

00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that recently got cancer?

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Now I can really back it.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.954 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Cause on-- when you
watch these reality TVs,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
there's a formulaic way of
presenting the information.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
If you see one of
the contestants

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is-- this person just
recently overcome a tragedy,

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that means that you are
meant to align yourself

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.477 align:middle line:90%
with that particular contestant.

00:22:23.477 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
That is the way that
narrative is built,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.647 align:middle line:84%
so that you find the
"X-Factor" more entertaining

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
than you otherwise would.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it is in fact, as
you know in your heart, shit.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Although if you
start watching it,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
you will become engaged,
like pornography.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Best not to start.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what Terence
McKenna says.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Unplug, don't go in.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
go in, you're in.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:90%
It just begins to take you down.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.688 align:middle line:90%
And I also think--

00:22:42.688 --> 00:22:43.584 align:middle line:90%
And heroin.

00:22:43.584 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:90%
But it is heroin.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.601 align:middle line:84%
It is heroin.
-Once you start--

00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It'd be, ah, I'd
love some more now.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
No, exactly.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.949 align:middle line:84%
-I feel relaxed.
-Absolutely.

00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:50.695 align:middle line:90%
Have a bit more.

00:22:50.695 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I'm more relaxed.
More.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.686 align:middle line:90%
Well, not so relaxed now.

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
it feeds on itself.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, the more you go
in, it depresses you.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.211 align:middle line:84%
It makes you feel
bad about yourself.

00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
You're no one.
You're nothing.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you get more, and you keep
getting further and further

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and further down the hole.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you go, all
right, I'm refusing that.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I actually think I am OK.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.259 align:middle line:84%
I am somebody.
I exist.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:90%
What matters to me is real.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:90%
What happens to me is real.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:90%
It has value.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to chart
a different course.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's very hard if you're
plugged into that system,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.975 align:middle line:90%
cause it's really powerful.

00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they don't like
it when you're defiant.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
If you go, I don't really
want none of your stuff now.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, it's
really good, our stuff.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And you go, but I
still don't want it.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:90%
We will kill you.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.604 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:30.604 --> 00:23:32.824 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll have
some of this stuff.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that doesn't satisfy
our real needs, what does?

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole idea from
Joseph Chilton Pearce,

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately there's a
human need for transcendence.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Or initiatory experience.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Like something that--
that's why people

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
seek out ayahuaska and
shamanic experience and so on.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Is that a possible
future direction?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that
through meditation?

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:90%
You encounter those types of--

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I got no choice, have I?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.679 align:middle line:84%
Cause I got a big--
the whole drug problem

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and abstinence based recovery.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So for me-- but I agree
that you're right.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I think a certain
percentage of the population

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
probably needs
transcendent experiences.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
early societies were

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:90%
formalized-- tribal societies.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But I don't imagine
everyone in the village

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
was a witch doctor,
necking bunches of plants

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:90%
and having crazy visions.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Cause who's gonna
[BLEEP] cut the crops

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and look after all the
cooking and everything?

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But some people have got to
have transcendent experiences,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
so they can report
back like, ah, you

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
think that this is all real.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry, it's not.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:90%
You make a pot.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:90%
You do some cooking.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:90%
All right, cool.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can't be the shaman,
otherwise, who's gonna wash up?

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But also, what are
transcendent experiences?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
To me-- and I'm in
the same boat as you,

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.805 align:middle line:84%
having been off drugs and
alcohol for a long time.

00:24:40.805 --> 00:24:41.755 align:middle line:90%
It's hard, isn't it?

00:24:41.755 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, really hard.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:90%
But I've been alive already.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I feel, for me,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is transcendence comes
through connection.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like, so much
of my life I was

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:90%
so afraid to connect to this.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:90%
To this body.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:90%
To this being.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And to other people.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Because my heart was
just too vulnerable.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, I feel
like, OK, connection,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:90%
that's where we transcend.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It's when we actually look
at someone, touch someone.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:90%
They're real, they're physical.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.266 align:middle line:84%
They're connected to us.
You know?

00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Was that some of it then?

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.492 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:25:12.492 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:90%
That was nice.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Makes me want to
cry a little bit.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So the self is an
artificial construct,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and we can begin
to diminish this

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.391 align:middle line:84%
by valuing other people and
other people's needs as much

00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
as our own.
It's in the Bible anyway.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Love thy neighbor.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.326 align:middle line:84%
Which we knew when
we were tribal,

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't even have such
a sense of individual I-self.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We had more of a
sense of a group self.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We're a bunch of ants, all
scurrying about helping.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I heard a story
about these people

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.079 align:middle line:84%
who were making a film
about-- documentary

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:90%
about Australian Aboriginals.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.175 align:middle line:84%
But they showed them a
bunch of documentaries,

00:25:38.175 --> 00:25:39.341 align:middle line:84%
they asked them,
how do they really

00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:90%
want to be shown in the film?

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
They said they didn't want
there to be any closeups.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
They wanted the whole tribe
to be visible in every frame.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.836 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:25:47.836 --> 00:25:48.726 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:50.025 align:middle line:84%
Difficult challenge
for the filmmaker,

00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
as the closeup is a necessary
component of storytelling.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.278 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:25:54.278 --> 00:25:55.532 align:middle line:90%
Maybe old storytelling.

00:25:55.532 --> 00:25:57.627 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the old way of
telling a story, you know?

00:25:57.627 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Ah, we've got to do
some ch-ch-ch-changes,

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.886 align:middle line:90%
as Ziggy predicted.

00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so how do you guys see
that culture could change over

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the next period to kind of
reflect this new realization

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
or understanding.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Have I got a say?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.333 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Go for it, yeah.

00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
This new culture-- I think
that Eve should go first,

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:90%
cause if you--

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:84%
No, no you go
ahead, you're on it.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
How's it gonna
reflect the changes?

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well I think that our last lot,
that already know this stuff,

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
have to sort of be
cool and relaxed,

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and be ready to protest
in a relaxed way.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Recognize the causes that are
in alignment with what we want,

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and so that we can coalesce.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Not get all bogged down in the
same egotistical pitfalls that

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
have befell our great
heroes of the '60s.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.225 align:middle line:84%
Me, for example, I'm
very egotistical.

00:26:36.225 --> 00:26:37.525 align:middle line:84%
So I'll always have
a bit of a problem,

00:26:37.525 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
cause a little bit down the
line I'll start to go, god,

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I look great being a hippie.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get carried
away with this.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we sort of let them
police ourselves a little bit,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't, sort
of, get all carried away.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't be all wishy-washy
and bullshit and humorless.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Cause that shit's boring.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.714 align:middle line:84%
No one wants a revolution where
everyone's going, hey man,

00:26:54.714 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I've made a vegan roast.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be a
little bit more- grrr.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:90%
The chaos of the trickster.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:00.721 align:middle line:10%
Bring it.
-Yeah--

00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:10%
Revolution is sexy.
---I'm with that.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:10%
So I think all just play
our individual roles--

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Vaginas alive.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:90%
--coalest, subjugate the ego.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
No, I totally agree.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.077 align:middle line:84%
I think every
revolution we're talking

00:27:10.077 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:90%
about now in the future--

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.441 align:middle line:84%
Did you say-- what
did you say just then?

00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I was just saying vaginas.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking about why--

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.158 align:middle line:90%
You read my mind.

00:27:17.158 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
No, but, I was thinking about
why did V-Day take off, right?

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Because it was about vaginas.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.552 align:middle line:84%
It was about people
thinking about sex.

00:27:24.552 --> 00:27:26.085 align:middle line:84%
It was about people
thinking about connection.

00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:10%
It was about people-- and
it was so outrageously

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:10%
ridiculous that everybody
started performing

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.821 align:middle line:10%
it in all these countries.

00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It had the trickster in it.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.704 align:middle line:84%
Abbie Hoffman is like one of
my favorite people of all--

00:27:34.704 --> 00:27:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my mother edited
his first book, actually.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love Abbie Hoffman.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
"Revolution for
the Hell of It."

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.269 align:middle line:90%
RUSSELL BRAND: Cool.

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Abbie Hoffman was
my deep inspiration.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.115 align:middle line:84%
Because he was wild, and he
was a clown, and he was-- it's

00:27:43.115 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:90%
why I love Russell so much.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he's--
you don't know

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.506 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen next.
It's unexpected.

00:27:47.506 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
-We don't know.
-We don't know.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's when
things change, when you're

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.422 align:middle line:90%
living in that quixotic place.

00:27:52.422 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Quixotic?

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Like Don Quixote?

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
He was a right
[INAUDIBLE], mind you.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:90%
He imagined everything.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, we don't know that
this frequency of reality

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate reality.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, imagination's OK then.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
