00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Right now we have more than
7 billion people on the earth.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.730 align:middle line:10%
And our ranks are
growing quickly.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
as automation grows,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.880 align:middle line:10%
we have less need
for so many workers.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The poet, Wendell Berry,
asked the question,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:90%
"What are people for?"

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
This has never seemed more
pertinent, more important

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:90%
for us to answer.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts noted that
just as the apple tree

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
naturally produces
fruits, as he put it,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:90%
"The apple tree apples."

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The earth is
peopling, constantly

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
making more and more of us.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Just as apple seeds
spread to other orchards

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and make more apple trees,
it might make sense,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
by analogy, that the
destiny of humanity

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
is to settle other worlds.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.575 align:middle line:84%
In the future, I tend to
think that humanity will

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:90%
aim in two directions at once.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
I mean, why not?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Why not build star ships
and colonize space?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
On the other, why not
explore the inner dimensions

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of the psycho cosmos, the realms
known to shamans and mystics

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:90%
through time?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we may learn
that the inner dimensions

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
within the psyche are just as
fast as the outer dimensions

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.188 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos.

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:90%

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.084 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey there.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to this episode
of "Mind Shift."

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck,
and today we'll

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:10%
be interviewing, discussing
with Howard Bloom, author

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:10%
of "The Lucifer Principle,"
"The God Problem,"

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:10%
and a number of other books.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll then be introducing Howard
to two young entrepreneurs,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Amber Lasciak and Miki Agrawal.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Bloom's
fascination with science

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
started at a young age.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And he dove into the
study of microbiology,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
theoretical physics, and
cosmology at the age of 10.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
At 16 he worked
as a lab assistant

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:84%
in the world's largest
cancer research facility

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and went on to graduate
Magna Cum Laude

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%
and Phi Beta Kappa from NYU.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
He then did the
unthinkable and turned down

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
four graduate school fellowships
to form his own music

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
publicity company.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
The Howard Bloom
Organization became

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
one of the top
publicity companies

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:90%
in the music industry.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And Howard was instrumental
in building or sustaining

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
the careers of Prince,
Michael Jackson,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Bob Marley, Paul Simon, Queen,
KISS, AC/DC, among many others.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:10%
He also has written several
well-respected and widely

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:10%
successful books-- "The Lucifer
Principle," "A Scientific

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:10%
Exploration in the
Forces of History,"

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:10%
"The Genius of the
Beast-- A Radical Revision

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:10%
of Capitalism," "Global Brain--
The Evolution of the Mass

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:10%
Mind From the Big Bang
to the 21st Century,"

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:10%
and "The God Problem-- How
a Godless Cosmos Creates."

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:10%
Howard Bloom is considered by
many to be one of the greatest

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:10%
living thinkers.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And according to Britain's
Channel 4, next in a lineage

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:10%
of seminal thinkers
that includes Newton,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Darwin, Einstein, and Freud.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.034 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:10.962 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Howard, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
-It's great to see you.
-It's great to see you.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
When we originally met
a number of years ago,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:90%
I think I visited you.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And you were bedridden
at that point.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely stuck
in bed for 15 years.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:10%
And for five years,
too weak to speak,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:10%
too weak to have another
person in the room.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
You came in when I was
able to talk again.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It was-- what was the syndrome?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.405 align:middle line:90%
It's chronic fatigue syndrome.

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:32.105 align:middle line:90%
It's vicious.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:32.865 align:middle line:90%
It's nasty.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:90%
It's brutal.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And it teaches you all kinds
of amazing lessons about life.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And how did you finally shake
it, just out of curiosity?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:90%
A good question.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
A combination of
drugs, pharmaceuticals

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
from big pharma, specifically
one called Gabapentin.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Another drug that I have to
give myself a shot of every day.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
It's oxytocin.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the social hormone.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the bonding hormone.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Makes a huge difference.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And God knows what else, Daniel.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.326 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about Howard Bloom.

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:03.025 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
What are all-- what are all
these-- these massive tomes?

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was a kid who nobody
wanted in Buffalo, New York,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little kid,
this grim industrial town.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of 10, when
I was very, very alone

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and very, very
depressed, two guys

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:90%
reached out to save my life.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
One was they reached
out through books.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:90%
One was Galileo.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And a book that
appeared on my lap

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
one day, in my great
big living room

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
said, the first two principles
of science, the first two rules

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
of science are these--
the truth at any price,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
including the
price of your life.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And that resonated with me.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a law of courage.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And the second
law of science was

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
look at things right
under your nose

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
as if you've never
seen them before.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Look at things that you
and everybody around you

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
take for granted as if you
have never seen them before.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And then proceed from there.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a religion, those
two laws, science.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And my life was
saved by two guys

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
who had reached out over 350
years to grab me before I fell.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
If there was-- if you were
to sum up all the books that

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
you've-- that you've written
and the thoughts that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
you've assimilated in,
like, a concise paragraph,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
what would you say kind of,
like, your project is in a way?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
My project is to take
every single science

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that a limited
brain can possibly

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
grasp, to put them together
with all the history

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:90%
that you can possibly assemble.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I've been assembling
it for 60 years now.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm 70 years old.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And with all of the arts, all
of the insights from the arts,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
all of the insights from your
territories, from mysticism,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
put them together
into a big picture

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to fashion new lenses with which
people could see everything

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
inside of them and
everything around them

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:84%
in ways they've never
imagined before.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
ultimate advantage

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
of having that new lens
or that new perspective?

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate advantage
to the individual

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the greatest
things in the world, one

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.375 align:middle line:84%
of the most exhilarating
things you can possibly possess

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:06.101 align:middle line:90%
is insight.

00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Insight every day, being able
to look at the pen in your hand

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly see it as if you've
never seen-- seen it before,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:90%
as if it's a freaking miracle.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, to be able
to get an intellectual sense.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Not just a sense of wonder.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Not just a sense of awe,
but a sense of where it fits

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:90%
in the world, in a new way.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the greatest
highs you can possibly imagine.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go through
a few of the books just

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:90%
step-- one by one here.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
"The Lucifer Principle,"
what was basically your sort

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:90%
of thrust with that book?

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dorion Sagan
and Lynn Marguilis.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.805 align:middle line:84%
Dorion Sagan is Carl
Sagan's oldest son.

00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Lynn Margulis was
Dorion Sagan's mother

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and Carl Sagan's first wife.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And she's a National Medal
of Science winning biologist.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
The two of them had written an
article in which they exalted

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
over a mass die
off that happened

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:90%
roughly two billion years ago.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And it exalted over it
because it's the mass

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
die off that made
the kinds of cells

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
that make you and me up today.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:90%
This is when the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.035 align:middle line:84%
This is The Great
Oxygen Catastrophe.

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
-Right, right, right.
-Yeah.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's when--
-Can you explain what happened?

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
It's when-- cyanobacteria,
for about 2 billion years,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
have been pulling off
a goddamned miracle.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They have been snatching photons
which could destroy things.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They've been snatching
radiation from the air

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and knitting it together with
elements of the air and water

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and creating bio stuff, creating
cell stuff, creating life.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And the problem was there
was stuff they could process.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
There was stuff they
couldn't process.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.905 align:middle line:84%
So they took the stuff
they could process.

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And they turned out life and
more life and even more life.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.095 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazement.

00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a wonder.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
fart out the stuff

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
that they could not process.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It was a toxic waste.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, a colony--
bacteria-living colonies,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:90%
they're not individuals.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:90%
They live in big groups.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're groups of
seven trillion, roughly.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
More-- more-- more
bacteria in one

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
group than all the humans who've
ever lived on planet Earth.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of those colonies could
fit on the palm of your hand.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it can be so thin
that you cannot see.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's invisible.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So the farts of a
bunch of bacteria

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.530 align:middle line:84%
whose entire colonies are so
thin you can't even see them?

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
What's that going to
amount to on a planet

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
with a huge atmosphere?
Nothing.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, over
two billion years,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
the farts built up.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.675 align:middle line:84%
And they built up
to the point where

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
we had a toxically-polluted
atmosphere.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.505 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere was
killing off the bacteria.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
It was killing off the first
life forms on this planet.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was called--
well, we won't go into what

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:90%
it was called for a second.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Some bacteria worked
out a very clever deal.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
There were
teenie-weenie bacteria

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that knew how to take
this toxic pollutant

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and actually turn it into
stuff that could make energy.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So the big bacteria made a
deal with the little bacteria.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
You live inside of us.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll find you the
greatest places

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:90%
you ever imagined to live.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll get you every resource
you ever imagined in life.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
We'll keep you feasting
and happy like crazy.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
You just feed us
what you shit out.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
shat out-- what

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
these little tiny
things that feasted

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
on the toxic
pollutants shat out--

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
were ambrosia to
the big bacteria.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that toxic pollutant--
the big, first, really big

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
toxic pollutant catastrophe
in the history of the planet--

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that toxic pollutant was
called oxygen. And there's

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
a lesson in that, which
is every toxic pollutant

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%
is a fuel waiting to be found.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a resource.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It is-- it's a feast
waiting to be discovered.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one idea you discussed
in "The Lucifer Principle"

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is kind of conceiving
of evil differently.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
When they wrote
exultantly about this mass

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
die off that killed off
almost everything on Earth,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.633 align:middle line:84%
I thought what did we
learn from World War II?

00:09:40.633 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't stand by and exalt
over a mass murder of any kind.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You rebel against it with
all your heart and soul.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a book specifically
about mass murder,

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
about hatred, about
violence, about war,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
about it's evolutionary origins,
about how essential evil is

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to nature, and how essential
it is that we oppose

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:90%
nature to make nature just.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that opposing of nature.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean exactly?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it meant, in the case
of the bacteria that managed

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to escape the Great
Oxygen Catastrophe,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
taking something that
seemed brutally unnatural,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
this poisonous gas, oxygen,
and turning it into the source

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
of the next paradise.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
for human beings?

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
What it means for human beings
is re-conceiving everything

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
around us that we
were regard as dark

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and ominous as a
potential resource.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Including, for
example, right now

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:84%
our major concern is the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Another major concern
is global warming.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Look, nature's taken
advantage of global warming

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
She's had it over and over
again, long before we existed.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that natured
used a climate catastrophe

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
to create was the human brain.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
We grew up on the
edge of glaciers.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:90%
We grew up in an age of ice.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
We grew up overcoming
catastrophe.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
That's how we got the
brains we have today.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to take
these two big challenges

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and to turn them into the
next great source of wonder.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Global warming
and carbon dioxide?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that carbon
dioxide in the air

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is just-- it's fuel and
energy waiting to be made.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do that?

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a friend
who is the chief scientist

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
at NASA Langley.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to take
massive quantities of algae.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Algae are really good-- two
things are really good at this.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
They really know how
to take carbon dioxide

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and make the most of it.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Trees and algae.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, anything
that's green knows

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
how to take carbon dioxide
and make the most of it.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
So encourage green things.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the green
things are already

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
encouraging themselves,
thanks to modern agriculture,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:90%
which we're supposed to hate.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Our footprint on
the land, in order

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to feed seven
billion people now,

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
is so much smaller than it used
to be that it's ridiculous.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Which means there are vast
amounts of former farmland

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.679 align:middle line:90%
that have been--

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Are you including aspects
like a nitrogen runoff

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:90%
from industrial pollution?

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
No I'm not including
that for the moment.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:90%
But we could discuss that too.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The point is that forests are
taking over the empty farmland

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:90%
that's been left behind.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And forests are great at
processing carbon dioxide.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
We can take algae and
turn them into fuel.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Liquid fuel, we can turn
them into just about any kind

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:90%
of energy source you want.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And the trick is to raise
them in mass quantities

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and get them to gobble that
stuff up out of the atmosphere

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into hey, the
next great source of wealth.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are concerned

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.877 align:middle line:84%
that humanity-- I mean, it's
such a complicated moment.

00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, we seem like we've

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.179 align:middle line:84%
never been doing better.
-Right.

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I have
discussed how people are living

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
longer and healthier lives.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.067 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, in
the industrialized

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:90%
first-world countries.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, a lot of
us feel that we're

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
teetering on the
brink of potentially

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:90%
annihilating ourselves.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
oceans becoming

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
30% more acidic, the
species extinction crisis,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:90%
the coral reefs disintegrating.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Is your perspective, then,
that we're kind of, like,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
in the process of kind of
overcoming these obstacles?

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We are in the process of
overcoming the obstacles.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:84%
All of the protest movements
against these problems

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
are extremely helpful in
overcoming the obstacles.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have to keep
from doing ourselves

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:90%
in with a negative perception.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, since 18-- if we'd
been born at 1850-- the two

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
of us sitting at this
table, the people

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this room--
our life expectancy

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:90%
would've been 38.5 years.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
If we'd been born in
2000, our life expectancy

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
would have been 78.5 years.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a doubling of
the human lifespan.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
If we'd been the poorest-paid
worker in London in 1850

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
versus the poorest-paid
worker or being

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
the poorest-paid worker
in London in 2000.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In 2000 we would've earned
what an entire tenement

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
full of the poorest-paid workers
in London earned back in 1850.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention the fact that
there were things-- there was

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
a techno freak back in
England, in 1850, who just-- he

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
loved the latest technologies.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
He had all the
power in the world.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
He was able to summon the
technologists from all

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:84%
over the world to bring their
latest items to London just

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
for his edification.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
He built a building for it.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Crystal Palace.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
His name was Prince Albert.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And he died at something
like 42 years old.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have access
to the simple medicines

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that the poorest
person in London

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
today would have
access to like that,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to solve their health problems.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize the
positives and build on them.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If we fail to recognize
the positives,

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
we humans have this
peculiar quality.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It is an apocalypse addiction.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And we come up with apocalypse--

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, the word
apocalypse literally

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
means uncovering or revealing.
-Yes.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.913 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're talking
more of a catastrophic--

00:14:35.913 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking catastrophic
apocalypse, as opposed

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:90%
to an apocalypse of revelation.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we believe
the world is ending.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
But we've believed this
for tens of thousands

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:90%
of years, over and over again.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
It's never quite happened.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is possible to end an
entire civilization by focusing

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:84%
only on disaster
and not seeing what

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
you're positively creating.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Because our job is
the positive creation.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.146 align:middle line:84%
-Look how excited you are.
-Yeah.

00:15:01.146 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:90%
With this stuff.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But Daniel, look, I'm
70-freaking years old.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I did 330 push ups this
morning before I came here.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I'm doing
the stuff I care about.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we all do the
stuff we care about,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
just think how much
further we'll all-- I mean,

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:90%
this planet will go.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.264 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:15:22.264 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the concept
of the technological singularity

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that people like Ray
Kurzweil have been espousing.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a silly idea.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
our technology will

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
reach a point where
all of a sudden

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:90%
we will cease to be human.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be something
beyond human.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But Daniel, during
your lifetime and mine,

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
how many singularities of this
kind have we already undergone?

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
When you were a
little kid there was

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
no such thing as a cellphone.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
When you were a little kid
you couldn't own a laptop.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:90%
They existed.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't own one.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
There were certainly no
such thing as an iPad.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Today-- back then, when
you walked down the street,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
you could dream about
talking to people in Beijing.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you were
bored out of your skull.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And in your brain you were
arguing with your mom.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you had nothing to do.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can actually
talk to a friend in Beijing

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
while you're walking
down the street.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
People can complain
about your texting

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:90%
to somebody in San Jose.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I guess
the devil's advocate--

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.076 align:middle line:84%
 --a lot of people
talk about how, like,

00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
there's sort of a
disintegration of the attention

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
span and inability to focus.
-There is a massive--

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was that book
called "The Shallows,"

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
which looked at how the internet
has had all this negative--

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy.
First of all, there are facts.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.606 align:middle line:84%
And the facts are that,
again, if you had--

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
if you gave the average
dumb kid-- the average kid

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.265 align:middle line:84%
with an IQ of 100--
an IQ test from 1900,

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
a Stanford Binet
IQ Test, he would

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:90%
register as a marginal genius.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:90%
100-- roughly 135 IQ.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the IQ points have
gone up 35 points since 1900.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's going up
not because we are

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
dumbing down in "The Shallows."

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's people like the author of
"The Shallows" who are dumb.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not seeing the facts
in front of their nose.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how to
integrate seven or eight

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
streams, perceptual streams
simultaneously, in ways

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:09.334 align:middle line:90%
we couldn't even imagine.

00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:11.467 align:middle line:84%
Is that what all your different
gadgets in your pockets are all

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:12.009 align:middle line:84%
about?
-Yes, exactly.

00:17:12.009 --> 00:17:13.042 align:middle line:90%
What do they all do, actually?

00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm on 24-hour
information flow.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.058 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way I like it.

00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:18.213 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
What does that mean?

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:18.979 align:middle line:90%
That sounds terrifying.

00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It means that
this is the Kindle.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
This has a complete
library in it.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has hundreds
and hundreds of books in it.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it reads the
books out loud to me

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:84%
while I'm walking
down the street

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
or taking a walk in the
park and taking photos.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
You know, I take photos.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've been in Art Basel,
which is the most competitive

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%
art festival in North America.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm multitasking.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm wearing my camera.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It's in here.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
If I can only you know, fumble
hard enough to get to it.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The-- it's easier when
I'm in the park to get it.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's the camera.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm listening to
books while I'm walking

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.570 align:middle line:84%
through the park,
while I'm doing

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
this business of the
second law of science,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
look at things right
under your nose

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.347 align:middle line:84%
as if you've never
seen them before.

00:17:59.347 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then proceed from there.
-Composing symphonies.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.265 align:middle line:90%
A law of wonder.

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:02.435 align:middle line:90%
And so on, also?

00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm useless when
it comes to music.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so let's talk a little
bit about some of this work

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
you're doing with the Space
Development Steering Committee.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Ah, OK.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, about six or
seven years ago,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of people in the space
community sort of kidnapped me.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They kidnapped me
because I had written

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
a book, and "The
Lucifer Principle,"

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
about the necessity
of getting into space.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
necessity of getting

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:90%
into space for a second.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Once upon a time, there
was a quarter of a teaspoon

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:10%
of life on this planet.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:10%
And the task of that quarter
of a teaspoon of life

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:10%
was to expand as
rapidly as possible

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:10%
before the next
catastrophe could hit.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there had been
142 mass extinctions

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.901 align:middle line:84%
on this strange pebbled--
pebbled pea of a planet.

00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
-Pebble.
-Yeah.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this is not a
pleasant planet for life to be.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a planet
filled with poisons.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And the big task
for life was how

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to knit these poisons
into something biological

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
as rapidly as
possible and expand.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, we took a poisoned
planet and we greened it.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Look where it is today.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:90%
It's astonishing.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And all this was poison, Daniel.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
If we've done it with
one planet, and there

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.985 align:middle line:84%
all these planets
above our head,

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're belly aching about
running out of resources?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Are we nuts?

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
There are so many pebbles
up there waiting for us,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.254 align:middle line:84%
waiting to be greened,
that it's ridiculous.

00:19:17.254 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
up there waiting to be

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:90%
gardened that it defies belief.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about this Space
Development Steering Committee.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
You're working on it
with some astronauts.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.553 align:middle line:84%
You have Buzz
Aldrin, [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:24.553 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I-- yeah, I was
sort of pressured.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I was pressured into going to
a bunch of space conferences

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and giving a bunch of
lectures six years ago or so.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And at one of them, Buzz Aldrin,
the second man on the moon,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:90%
grabbed me.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And basically, kidnapped me
into starting this group.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.761 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, there's
a presidential election

00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
coming up.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff
you're talking about,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:84%
green-- gardening the galaxy,
greening the solar system,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
this stuff's gotta
be on the agenda.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I put this
group together.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's Buzz Aldrin.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It's Edgar Mitchell, the
sixth man on the moon.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a bunch of people
from NASA, the National

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.077 align:middle line:90%
Science Foundation.

00:19:58.077 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Edgar Mitchell was also
the founder of the Institute

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
of Noetic Sciences.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.429 align:middle line:84%
Yes he was.
And--

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about that
type of psychic research?

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that humans
have psychic capacities?

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It would be nice if humans
had psychic capacities.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that thanks
to our intuition--

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.087 align:middle line:84%
if we develop our intuition, if
we develop our empathy, if we

00:20:16.087 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:84%
take advantage of the
sides of ourselves

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that aren't recognized
by science right now

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
but are incredibly important
in understanding things,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:90%
boy, we can go a long distance.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Do we have telepathy?

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I really seriously doubt it.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Is the-- does the research
that's been going on

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:84%
at Princeton since I was a
little kid in paranormal stuff,

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
does that really interest me?
No.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't really believe in it.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But do I believe that we can
develop incredible abilities

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
to grok each other, and that
those abilities to understand

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
each other, to comprehend
each other by feeling

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
each other's fabric
in our own fabric,

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
do I think those things
are incredibly important?

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Do they expand the Noosphere?

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is a cosmos.
We're coming--

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should explain
the concept of the Noosphere

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and not assume that everybody--

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:90%
HOWARD BLOOM: OK.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's skip explaining
it for just a second

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to say that one of-- Teilhard
de Chardin, everybody

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:90%
knows who he is.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a Catholic intellectual
and he came up with an idea

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that this is a cosmos
that is beginning

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of itself.
How?

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Through you and me.
Through you and me?

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
That sounds very strange.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, we're
piles of protons.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
These protons have been
around since the beginning

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.930 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, 13.77
billion years ago.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're the first
collective project

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
the protons have put together
that has consciousness.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is
expanding bit by bit by bit,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and contributing to this
massive collective enterprise--

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
it's in global brain--
in which we are neurons--

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
ask you about that.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah-- called culture.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And the more concepts we can
contribute to culture that help

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos extend her own
understanding of herself,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:84%
hey, the greater the gift
to us in personal insight,

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and the further this
cosmos is going,

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
barreling down the
path to God knows

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%
where the cosmos is going.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
But it is going somewhere.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:90%
So I forget the question.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was asking you
about the Space Development

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Steering Committee, I believe.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about how-- the necessity

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
of getting off this planet.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Right, and the Noetic stuff.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:90%
So you were talking about--

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Right, Inst. of
Noetic Sciences.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:84%
 --yeah, Edgar--
Edgar's Noetic stuff.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, there is a validity.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Even for me, I'm a down-to-earth
sort of materialist.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a-- you
know, I dropped out

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.654 align:middle line:90%
of school to pursue [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:90%
When I was 18 years old.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And got-- and apparently
was so serious about it,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of people
dropped out of their jobs

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and started hitchhiking
and riding the rails

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and following me around
on the west coast.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And it became a movement.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So look, when you are
looking for insight,

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.990 align:middle line:90%
take every path you can.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the insights that
you get from enlightenment

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:90%
are incredibly important.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
So add those to the pile.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
They're necessities.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Science is about every adventure
you can possibly conceive,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
every adventure you can
possibly have in the name

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
of expanding insight.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Why expand insight?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you're expanding
that Noosphere.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You're expanding the cosmos
capacity to understand herself,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to reflect herself
symbolically in some way that's

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:90%
never been achieved before.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And your new book is
"The God Problem."

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.851 align:middle line:84%
The new book is
"The God Problem."

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And the new book--

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.116 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Well,
what "The God Problem?"

00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
"The God Problem" is
this-- if you're like me,

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
rigidly committed
scientistic person,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and you've got a problem.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:90%
How did the cosmos come to be?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
How did a nothing-- how did a
something come from a nothing?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
How did that something
develop into a little ball

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of space and time
expanding at super speed?

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
What the hell are
space and time?

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Where in the world did
space and time come from?

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
How did the first quarks--
the first particles--

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
come popping out of that space
and time is if from nowhere?

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.031 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:23:49.031 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:90%
How did you and I get here?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
These are enormous problems
of cosmic creativity.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't been
posed within science.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They are not being
posed, Daniel.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't pose a
problem you certainly are not

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to solve it.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
This book tries to put that
problem right in your face.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of--
what kind of ideas

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
do come up with as explanatory
grids or reference?

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea is called
Corollary Generator Theory.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you back to
when you were in high school

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and you were in geometry class.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning of the
year they gave you four axioms.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And for the rest of
the year, every week,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
you had to derive a
corollary from those axioms.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the year you
had the whole geometric system.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
How was an entire geometric
system implicit in four axioms?

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:10%
How was the equivalent
of an entire geometry

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:10%
book implicit in
165 words of axioms?

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
How in the world
does that happen?

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And supposing that the
universe started out like that.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the universe started out
with a handful of simple rules.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, three or four.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And then every
homework assignment,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
the Universe had to derive
the next set of corollaries,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the next things implicit
in those axioms.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Have you looked at
the work of Lee Smolin?

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:90%
HOWARD BLOOM: Yes, absolutely.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had an idea,
a cosmological idea,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that black holes are
kind of entry points

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
into new universes and
different cosmological concepts.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
And that's a nice idea.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But then the
question is how does

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
a black hole produce a cosmos?

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And how does the cosmos do
space and time, or whatever it

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:90%
does in its particular cosmos?

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%
How does it do matter?

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And this basically says,
supposing that the cosmos is

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
like a geometric system, like
a logical system-- it actually

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
uses Peano's postulates-- from
which, if you work hard enough,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
you can derive the
whole natural number

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
system-- roughly 12
textbooks worth of material--

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:90%
from 165 words.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, if
that hypothesis is accurate,

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
if that's how the universe
does do her thing, why?

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
How in the world
does that happen?

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
How in the world can
these massive amounts

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
of implicit stuff be there in
just a handful of magic beans?

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
foreseeing now?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you look at the near
future for human civilization,

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and even for New York?

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think New York is
in danger of being under flood

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:90%
waters in 20 years, 30 years?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for me to
judge the global warming

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and climate change predictions.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm inside of science
in my own peculiar outsider way.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I've watched is
this incredible conformity

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
enforcement within the
scientific community,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to go along with the
concept of global warming,

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and especially anthropogenic--
manmade-- global warming.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And the pressure's been intense.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's been like the days
of the Inquisition.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't believe
in the program

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't promote it you
were frozen out of science.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
That's not how science is done.
Now--

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have questions
whether anthropogenic climate

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:84%
change is happening?
-Yes.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the climate models
could be absolutely accurate.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
New York could end up
under 30 feet of water.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:90%
That would be a disaster.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But one thing to
recognize, Daniel,

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is that this has been
a planet of climate

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
change, massive climate change,
ever since the beginning.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.617 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time, we
had snowball artists.

00:27:09.617 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So whatever this
change is, it would

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.282 align:middle line:84%
be a catalyst for
the next evolution

00:27:13.282 --> 00:27:14.315 align:middle line:90%
of human culture in some sense?

00:27:14.315 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a catalyst for us
humans to wake up to the fact

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.725 align:middle line:84%
that this is not a
planet of stasis.

00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
That our ideas of
equilibrium-- as

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:84%
in thermodynamic equilibrium
and ecological equilibrium--

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:90%
are totally false.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing to do with
this universe we live in.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And that this is a universe in
a state of accelerating balance.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a balance.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
being on a bicycle.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to balance to the
left, balance to the right.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
keep moving forward,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:90%
you're dead in the water.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:90%
So there is never a stasis.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
There has never been
a Garden of Eden

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that
has just stayed

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, lush,
green and loving.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the other way around.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
This been a vicious planet where
terrible things have happened.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
We're the only ones who
conceive of just things.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to make justice
in this place of viciousness.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So how do you see,
potentially, human society

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
kind of evolving maybe, in
the next, like, half century?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I think we have-- and this
can't happen in half a century.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But we have to know that
everything that's ever been

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
on a seashore
eventually has ended up

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a
mountain, that this is

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:90%
a planet of cataclysmic change.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.437 align:middle line:90%
That it is not safe to--

00:28:20.437 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Do we have
a-- does humanity have a role

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
in the planet in some sense?
As a supported organism?

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.419 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We've been changing
things dramatically.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But remember, we're
not the first things

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:90%
to change things dramatically.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Look with those
cyanobacteria did

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
when they totally changed
the nature of the atmosphere

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.455 align:middle line:84%
Look what flowers did when they
enlisted animals in order to be

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:90%
their transport mechanisms.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we could say that
grain, wheat, barley, corn,

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:84%
have basically suckered us into
finding, absolutely, the best

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
places for them to live, the
best genetic combinations

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:90%
with which to survive.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, boy, they're going
they-- hogs and cattle

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and sheep-- are doing
incredible box office,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:90%
thanks to using us humans.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Suckering us into the process.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, but we do make change.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're the first
conscious change makers.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And we do have to know
that our cities will

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:90%
have to float at some point.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it won't happen-- and we
have to be beyond just settling

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:84%
a city on a shelf
next to a coast,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
assuming the coast is
going to stay there.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.859 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The coast is never
going to stay there.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to make cities that
can float with the change.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Potentially out in space.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, including
cities out in space.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you can take--
you can build a tin

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:90%
can out of glass and steel.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You can make it from
the lunar regolith.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
You can make it from the
rock and dust on the moon.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Or you can make it
from asteroid stuff.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You can rotate it to give
it artificial gravity.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
You can make a
big enough to have

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:90%
500 square miles of territory.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You can put forests, farms,
puppy dogs, wildlife,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
lakes, everything that
you love, everything

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
that you want up there.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:84%
You can make real
estate in space.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's making ecosystems.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:84%
That's making new
homes for life.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, in
the '60s, there was

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of you know,
kind of looking

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.464 align:middle line:90%
forward to space migration.

00:30:08.464 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, Timothy Leary, obviously--
-Right.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
 --was one of the people who
was involved in that idea.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it's like
our culture drifted away

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
from that as kind of a
motivation or incentive

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:90%
or even, like, an ideal.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
there was that drift?

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
it's possible that it

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
could be kind of
repositioned as-- as

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:90%
a central focus for the future?

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Societies go
through-- and humans,

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
you and I have done this--
we go through these flows.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And at some points we are
wildly exuberant about all kinds

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of possibility.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's a biological thing
and a perceptual thing.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into
the opposite, where we

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:90%
think everything is a danger.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a risk.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
We want to recoil
from everything.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And since the 1960s, especially
since the early 1970s,

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
our society's been in that
recoil from the natural world,

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:90%
as if everything is a danger.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a risk.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:90%
All we see are the dangers.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I got news for you.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:84%
The job of humanity is
to see the positive side

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:90%
to why, to make it happen.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
To make the next level
of evolution happen.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't do it,
the Chinese will do it.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Because right now they
have the kind of exuberance

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that we lost around 1973.
-The Chinese do?

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So-- so what--

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
HOWARD BLOOM: You look
doubtful about that, Daniel.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, today-- I mean,
what do you think

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:90%
is actually happening then?

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You think that-- I mean,
there's-- I noticed--

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in some of your work, a kind of
almost like a patriotic tinge

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.284 align:middle line:84%
of kind of, like, the
US has some kind of role

00:31:34.284 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:90%
to play or kind of potential.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm a wild American chauvinist.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:90%
I believe-- yeah.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I believe in freedom of speech.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I believe in pluralism.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I believe in tolerance.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe in nourishing new
points of view, constantly.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
shadow aspects of America?

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance, the
wars, the War on Drugs,

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
you know the massive
incarcerations of minority

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.113 align:middle line:90%
populations and all that stuff?

00:31:56.113 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Those things are hideous.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And under the president I voted
for, twice, Obama, they're

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:90%
getting worse, of all things.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
My president is
making things worse.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't seem to understand
the Constitution of the United

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.800 align:middle line:90%
States and what it stands for.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We still have the right to
protest against these things.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
We still have the right to stand
up and be counted, stand up

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and stand in the way, to
become obstacles in the path,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that the
principles that we believe in

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:84%
are principles that
are instantiated,

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that are turned
into realities, that

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
are reified in this country.
-Thank you.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.187 align:middle line:90%
What's your next book topic?

00:32:32.187 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you have another
one in the works?

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Case of
the Consumerist Cosmos."

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And it says that we are
making a massive mistake

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
in our definition of
nature, in our view

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:90%
of what nature is all about.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:90%
That we loathe several things.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.790 align:middle line:84%
We loathe consumerism,
materialism,

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.100 align:middle line:90%
vain display, and waste.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And we think those are
uniquely ours, uniquely

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Western, uniquely capitalist.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:90%
They've been in the cosmos.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:84%
They've been a part
of the cosmic process

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:90%
since the very beginning.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nature,
just as an example.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Nature, once upon
a time, invented

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:90%
this thing called death.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.960 align:middle line:84%
She invented it in
the days after she

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
birthed the first stars and
she started to kill them off.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Death is the most materialist
throw-away wasteful thing

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly imagine.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's vicious.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's cruel.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from nature.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So our job is to conceive
not only how to do

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
what nature does but better.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's how to do what
nature does but with more

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:90%
warmth and compassion.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate
to the subject of death?

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.215 align:middle line:90%
Well, death has got to go.

00:33:39.215 --> 00:33:41.075 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:42.935 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:42.935 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:90%
WOMAN: It's not going anywhere.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It's going somewhere.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We just heard a voice
from the gallery,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
saying that death is
not going anywhere.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I got news for you.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember those figures
on 1850 and the lifespan

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.280 align:middle line:90%
being 38.5 years?

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And today it is 78.5
years and climbing.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
Climbing at the rate of
three months for every year

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:90%
that you're alive.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We, somehow, without knowing
it, are setting death

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:90%
back big time, really big time.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for us
to wake up and stop

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
only glooming--
because that's what

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:90%
we're focused on these days.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We're obsessed with
gloom-- and look

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
at what we are
accomplishing so we can

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:90%
figure out how to do it better.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
If our grandparents could
put you and me at the point

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
where our lifetimes are
twice as long as theirs,

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
it's our job to make sure
that our great grandkids have

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
lives that are four
times as long as ours.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.793 align:middle line:90%
And how do you see that?

00:34:42.793 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems to
get back to these ideas

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:84%
of the technological singularity
and the biotechnology

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and nanotechnology
and their capacities.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:90%
We're not quite sure.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk
about nanotechnology

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and the singularity we're
talking as reductionists.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:84%
We're talking as if there's
just one silver bullet.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:90%
This is not planet.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:84%
This is not a cosmos
of silver bullets.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a cosmos
of big pictures.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a cosmos of grand
tapestries and grand weaves.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a cosmos of recipes.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have to stop
looking at things

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
as one individual
thing is the answer.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:90%
There are weaves of answers.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Why was I able to do
330 push ups today,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's a month after
I turned 70 years old?

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Daniel, I don't know.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is,
it's my job to find out

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
so that other people
can do it too.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what do you think
about capitalism itself?

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
would say that you know,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.675 align:middle line:84%
it's-- obviously, it's
produced a lot of these amazing

00:35:41.675 --> 00:35:43.374 align:middle line:84%
effects that you've discussed.
-Right.

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But that-- that
it's, obviously,

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
a very creative and
also, in some ways,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:90%
wasteful and destructive system.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that capitalism
or certain aspects of it

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:90%
might be transitional?

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Or do you feel that with
capitalism we discovered

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
something that's kind
of totally in alignment

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with nature's principles
and that'll always

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
be with us in some sense?

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
capitalism is totally aligned

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.240 align:middle line:90%
with nature's principles.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Because just like nature,
we don't understand it.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%
We understood Marxism.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a nice big book
about it by Karl Marx.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a philosophy.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Capitalism is not a philosophy.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It grew of itself.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're not quite
entirely sure how.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism has its creative
aspect and it is phenomenal.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Look at Miki and
her wild pizzas.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Miki, who's about
to come up on stage,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:90%
at God knows what moment.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But at any great, her
pizzas are incredible.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.270 align:middle line:90%
She has an underwear company.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And the underwear company's
trying to accomplish things

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:90%
for girls that are phenomenal.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
These are things that you
can do with capitalism.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a
freaking science geek.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
That's all I am, which
means I'm incapable of doing

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:90%
anything real in life.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.871 align:middle line:10%
But I ran-- but I ran two
successful businesses.

00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:48.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I needed to get out
there into the real world

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and do some expeditions
and explore where

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:90%
the wild ones were.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And capitalism
allowed me to do that.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was a phenomenal,
phenomenal experience.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Are there criminal
aspects to capitalism?

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:90%
But what's our job?

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't tear cities apart
and go back to the countryside

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
because there are
muggers in the streets.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:90%
We stop the muggers.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job
to stop the muggers

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.924 align:middle line:84%
in the capitalist system too.
-Awesome.

00:37:12.924 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, listen, let's
take a little break.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:18.028 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back with Miki
Agrawal and Amber Lasciak.

00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:19.161 align:middle line:84%
HOWARD BLOOM: All
right, terrific.

00:37:19.161 --> 00:37:20.622 align:middle line:84%
-Thanks so much.
-Thanks.

00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Miki Agrawal has
taken socially-conscious

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:84%
entrepreneurship
to another level.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
After discovering she
was lactose intolerant,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:84%
she founded a highly
acclaimed farm-to-table pizza

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
restaurant that offers Vegan
alternatives called Wild.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:10%
She is also a co-founder of
Thinx, a company that empowers

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:10%
women by producing a high-tech
underwear solution for women

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:10%
during their time of the month.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Thinx has teamed
up with AFRIpads

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.945 align:middle line:84%

to the massive amounts
of New York City waste

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.880 align:middle line:90%

REDU's governing belief is with
the infusion of creativity,

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.150 align:middle line:10%
there is no such
thing as garbage,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:10%
that garbage is a mentality.

[APPLAUSE]

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, everybody.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to "Mind Shift."

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm here right now with author,
Howard Bloom, and author, Miki

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:10%
Agrawal and entrepreneur
also, and entrepreneur

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:10%
and filmmaker, Amber Lasciak.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So I thought we could
talk a little bit.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, why don't
you guys introduce yourselves?

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.473 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what you do.

00:39:27.473 --> 00:39:28.872 align:middle line:84%
MIKI AGRAWAL: Sure.
-Miki?

00:39:28.872 --> 00:39:30.003 align:middle line:90%
We already heard from Howard.

00:39:30.003 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:90%
MIKI AGRAWAL: Yeah, OK.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.854 align:middle line:90%
So Hi, Amber, how are you?

00:39:32.854 --> 00:39:33.554 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:39:33.554 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Howard.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my-- I went
to Cornell University.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And my journey began like
a typical college graduate,

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:90%
working in investment banking.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:90%
And then 9/11 happened.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And I was supposed to
be there on that day,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.260 align:middle line:10%
working on Wall Street.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But that day I happened to
sleep through my alarm clock.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
supposed to be there.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Two people in my office died.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
crazy experiences.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.687 align:middle line:84%
And I just started asking
myself questions after that.

00:39:56.687 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, what
am I passionate about?

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:84%
What am I here--
what's my purpose?

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's I started
writing things down.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of wrote
down three things.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:84%
One was to play
soccer professionally.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:90%
One was to make movies.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And the other was
to start a business.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I just, I did all three.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:10%
I played soccer for
the New York Magic

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and then hurt my--
and blew out my knees.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:90%
The story's in the book.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I worked in
the film business.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.824 align:middle line:84%
And I worked my
way up from a PA,

00:40:21.824 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:84%
like, picking up
trash in the streets.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.501 align:middle line:84%
My Asian parents were like, what
are you doing out of Cornell?

00:40:25.501 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, picking up
trash in the streets?

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But worked my way up pretty
quickly and into producing

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.474 align:middle line:90%
commercials and music videos.

00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my stomach
started hurting all the time.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.673 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
sort of Eureka moment

00:40:34.673 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:84%
began for my first
business, which was

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.440 align:middle line:90%
an alternative pizza concept.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So I had sort of
started, you know,

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.470 align:middle line:84%
getting stomach aches
every time I came home.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
is going on my stomach?

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And I started researching.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that I
was lactose intolerant.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just stopped
eating dairy to see.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And it actually worked.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
My bloating and my gas and
all that stuff, went away.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and I just-- but
then I went to Europe.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And I went to, like, this,
you know, French countryside.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And I ate tons of cheese because
that's what you do in Europe.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.395 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking myself,
like, why am I not-- why-- why,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.230 align:middle line:84%
when I go to Europe,
and to a French

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.130 align:middle line:84%
countryside I can eat dairy, but
when I come to the US I can't?

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And in more research
I discovered

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that it's the process-- it's the
way dairy is being processed.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so all this to
say, I had I'd given

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:90%
up pizza at the time in the US.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.505 align:middle line:84%
And I researched pizza
and discovered that

00:41:23.505 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a $32-billion industry.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Americans eat 100 acres
of pizza every day.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And you know?

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.913 align:middle line:84%
And why were they not making
pizza for those-- you know,

00:41:31.913 --> 00:41:32.890 align:middle line:90%
who had intolerances?

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, right
now, there are 20%

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:90%
of Americans eat gluten free.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, one in five Americans
are lactose intolerant.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.390 align:middle line:84%
They're just these
huge statistics.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And the big giant pizza
industry leaders weren't

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:90%
making it better for you.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:45.207 align:middle line:90%
As I said, screw it.

00:41:45.207 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I've no experience in anything.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.639 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to
start a pizza place.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I started my
first farm-to-table pizza

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.080 align:middle line:90%
place called Slice.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.415 align:middle line:90%
And now it's called Wild.

00:41:53.415 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Without any experience,
yeah, whatsoever.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, you know, we-- I opened
my first tiny little place

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.640 align:middle line:90%
in the Upper East Side.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And then opened my second
place in the West Village.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And now opening a big
location in downtown Vegas,

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:84%
with Tony Hsieh, who's
the CEO of Zappos--

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
he's my business
partner-- and opening

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:90%
more locations thereafter.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So things are really
exciting there.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and maybe you
can just quickly

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.860 align:middle line:84%
tell us about your new
book, "Do Cool Shit.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.761 align:middle line:84%
So well, I mean, I do want to
talk about my other business

00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:90%
really quickly.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm really
passionate about it.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.577 align:middle line:84%
So every month, as
women here, like,

00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:28.710 align:middle line:84%
can we just a quick
show of hands,

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:84%
how many girls have had an issue
every time they menstruate?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, where they forget
to change their tampon and pad

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and have an accident
in their underwear?

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, how many girls have
had this happen to them?

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Can we show of hands?

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Every single girl, right?

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, so every girl.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:84%
We've faced this issue where
we're running around all day.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're, like, oh my god,
I forgot to change my tampon

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.333 align:middle line:84%
and you leak into your underwear
and stain your underwear.

00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, the question
was, how is it possible

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.154 align:middle line:84%
that in hundreds of years, you
know, that girls have been--

00:42:56.154 --> 00:42:57.320 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of
years this has been

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.635 align:middle line:84%
happening for women--
there's no innovation

00:42:59.635 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:90%
in undergarments for women?

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.902 align:middle line:84%
And so we spent the last
three years inventing

00:43:02.902 --> 00:43:04.635 align:middle line:84%
a pair of underwear that's
leak and stain resistant,

00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:07.350 align:middle line:84%
that's beautiful, breathable,
washable, and sexy.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's called Thinx.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
really proud of it

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
because it really solves a huge
problem that every single girl

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:90%
has every single month.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing was, I'd been

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:90%
traveling to India and Africa.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.840 align:middle line:84%
In my travels to Africa
I met a young girl

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:90%
named Amale on a weekday.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And Master I asked her,
why aren't you in school?

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "It's
my week of shame."

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, your
week of shame?

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I discover
that she misses up

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:84%
to one week of school
every single month

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.060 align:middle line:90%
because of her period.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And she starts-- and she
uses things like sticks,

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:90%
leaves, mud, rags, bark.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just crazy to think about.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so 100 million girls
drop out of school every year

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because something as
natural as their periods.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's just something
had to change.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we partnered up
with an organization

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
called AFRIpads that produces
washable cloth pads for girls.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So for every pair of
underwear we sell here,

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
solving a problem
for women here,

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
we fund seven washable cloth
pads that goes back to a girl

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:90%
in a developing country.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.293 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really,
really proud of it.

00:43:56.293 --> 00:43:57.129 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited.

00:43:57.129 --> 00:44:00.063 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
-Right.

00:44:00.063 --> 00:44:01.041 align:middle line:90%
And then, quickly, the book.

00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, so sorry.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, quickly, the book.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So the book kind of came
about because when I started

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:84%
my business, just so many
people came out of the woodwork

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and started asking me
how did you raise money?

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.070 align:middle line:90%
How did you get press?

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.905 align:middle line:84%
How did you build all
these collaborations?

00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:16.310 align:middle line:90%
How did you stay afloat?

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
95% of restaurants
close their first year.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.090 align:middle line:84%
85% of restaurants
close their second year.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Like, how is this?

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing this?

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And I realized--
and I started-- up

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.380 align:middle line:84%
to this point I'd read
tons of great books

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:84%
by great entrepreneurs like
Richard Branson and Tony Hsieh.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've read as many business
books as I possibly could.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But I fell asleep
after page three.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the question was can
you marry great storytelling

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.740 align:middle line:90%
with practical, tangible steps?

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.795 align:middle line:84%
Like, what-- how exactly
did you raise money?

00:44:44.795 --> 00:44:46.595 align:middle line:84%
What did you say in that
room to get that first dollar

00:44:46.595 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:90%
or the first believer?

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.570 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
"The New York Times"

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.103 align:middle line:84%
to write about you, when
you first-- you know,

00:44:51.103 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
when you were nobody,
you were nothing?

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, those were questions.
But what did you do?

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh, and then "The
New York Times" wrote about me.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and then, like,
great things happened.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.069 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, but
what did you say?

00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And how did that happen?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that granular,
how to go from step

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:90%
zero to step one was missing.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like can
you marry, again,

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.855 align:middle line:84%
storytelling with granular steps
to get people from step zero

00:45:08.855 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to step one, to really
fulfill their passion?

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Nice.
Yeah.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.045 align:middle line:84%
But it's also more
than a business book.

00:45:13.045 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
MIKI AGRAWAL: Yes.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you also began to
talk about things about how to,

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:90%
like, build a tribe and so on.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:90%
MIKI AGRAWAL: Right

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So can you explain how
the idea kind of extended?

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.359 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that I really

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.600 align:middle line:84%
explored a lot is just
friendships and the people

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I spend my time with.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And the saying, you are as good
as the five closest friends

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:90%
you keep.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I started to
really think about the people

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I spend my time with
and how I felt after I

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.410 align:middle line:90%
spent my time with them.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Was it depleting?

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And depleting doesn't mean,
like, oh they talked shit.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Depleting means did I
gain something from that?

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Am I inspired to do something?

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Am I-- do I feel like
I learned something?

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Or was I just, like,
exhausted because I just

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.890 align:middle line:84%
went and drank my
face off and watched

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.310 align:middle line:90%
football the whole weekend?

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That's just not
inspiring anymore.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think more and more
people are just sick of that.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know where
to go and what to do

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and how to build a community
of really inspiring friends

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate
negative relationships

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:90%
that just take space your life.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.141 align:middle line:84%
But they're comfortable because
you've had them for so long

00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:06.840 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how do you eliminate
that gently and create

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.295 align:middle line:84%
room, beautiful room,
for inspiring friends

00:46:11.295 --> 00:46:13.370 align:middle line:84%
to allow you to make
change in the world?

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.354 align:middle line:84%
And so those are also things
I have in my book because I'm

00:46:16.354 --> 00:46:18.209 align:middle line:84%
super passionate about it.
Yeah.

00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the Cool Shit?

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:84%
That's-- all of that is
part of doing cool shit.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Personal, business,
it's all so intertwined.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't fake that having--
being inspired and coming up

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:84%
with great ideas, you
can't do that if you

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:90%
have a depleting home life.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.050 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have both.
-Nice.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So Amber, you want to talk
a little bit about yourself

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.874 align:middle line:84%
and your passions here?
AMBER LASCIAK: Sure.

00:46:38.874 --> 00:46:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have so
many things I want.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to-- let's see.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, this desk
itself, right, is a product?

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:90%
This desk is a REDU.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:10%
It comes from-- so
basically, about a year ago

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.680 align:middle line:10%
I started a company
called REDU, REDU NYC.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a recycling or a
reuse and design company.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
specific about the word

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.580 align:middle line:90%
that you use these days.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we rescue
material waste and things that

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.380 align:middle line:84%
have been otherwise
discarded and make

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.160 align:middle line:84%
them into objects of use, like
this, like this desk we made.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.826 align:middle line:84%
There's an artist component.
Right?

00:47:22.826 --> 00:47:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of artisans?

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw a show you
had at a gallery in Chelsea.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we had our first
show a month and a half

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.300 align:middle line:90%
ago in Chelsea.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was really fun.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a donation for us from
Chashama company, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And we hadn't
actually opened up.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.307 align:middle line:84%
We haven't actually
opened up yet.

00:47:44.307 --> 00:47:45.140 align:middle line:90%
We're a start-up company.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We haven't opened up
yet to the public--

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.280 align:middle line:84%
although this was our first
exhibition-- because we

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.270 align:middle line:90%
got hit by Sandy so intensely.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were just about
to open up right before.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But this exhibition was
sort of, it was fun.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Because it was in a gallery.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was that ability to kind
of traverse that edge between

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
art and functionality, which is
such a-- it's kind of a fun--

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.400 align:middle line:90%
it's-- especially for me.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if something's
being discarded,

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:19.450 align:middle line:84%
then what you-- the fear is that
if somebody doesn't get it--

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:84%
which art, you know,
runs the risk of people

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.170 align:middle line:84%
not getting all the time-- then
it might get thrown away again.

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you add this
functional element to it

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.840 align:middle line:84%
then you're sort of ensuring
that it's not going to,

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.300 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, go back
into landfill,

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.851 align:middle line:84%
which is the whole reason
why I'm doing this.

00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.740 align:middle line:84%
We were talking upstairs about
how from your perspective

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the concept of REDU
is much larger.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:84%
This is almost like
a beginning stage.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But you have a deeper
vision of REDUing means

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.870 align:middle line:90%
and what needs be REDUn.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, REDU everything,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like-- I
feel like it's a-- I mean,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.397 align:middle line:84%
originally this started as
a-- it was going to be a film.

00:48:54.397 --> 00:48:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So I could-- because I feel
like-- because I've been

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:90%
in film for the last 15 years.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:59.350 align:middle line:90%
That was my main plan

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to make a film
about how I knew this could

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
work, the formula of
using discarded items

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and putting them back out into--
in a different-- reimaging them

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and having-- and
showing that everything

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.040 align:middle line:84%
has value with the
infusion of creativity.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, just a
little creativity.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.054 align:middle line:84%
And then, therefore, and
garbage no longer is garbage.

00:49:26.054 --> 00:49:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Garbage is a mentality.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we are starting
with furniture.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.450 align:middle line:90%
But I'd like to REDU everything.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:35.150 align:middle line:90%
What's everything?

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Give me some examples.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.480 align:middle line:90%
AMBER LASCIAK: Education.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The way that we're dealing
with the prison systems,

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
with the way that we
do so many things.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:84%
There are so many kind of
antiquated ideals and ways

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.275 align:middle line:84%
that we are-- we're working.
You know?

00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we treat
environmental, I mean,

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:54.745 align:middle line:90%
the planet?

00:49:54.745 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:84%
You know?
-Cool.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean,
listening to Howard

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:03.255 align:middle line:84%
speak before and his tremendous
exuberance around capitalism

00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and its creative and
destructive potential,

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and what I thought
about your projects

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is that you're really
entrepreneurs who

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.400 align:middle line:84%
are really engaged
in kind of rethinking

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:90%
and remaking capitalism.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering, Howard,
what's your perspective

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.700 align:middle line:90%
on what they're doing here?

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:84%
HOWARD BLOOM: I think
that capitalism really

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.210 align:middle line:84%
comes from what Miki
is talking about

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:23.310 align:middle line:90%
and what Amber is talking about.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:10%
But especially Miki is
talking about reaching

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.440 align:middle line:10%
into your deepest self, finding
the stuff that makes you

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.030 align:middle line:10%
exuberant, really exuberant.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Not the stuff that gives
you a stomach ache.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Not the stuff that puts you
to sleep over the weekend,

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:90%
the very opposite.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that just
thrills you to death.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And having a certain
amount of confidence

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that if you bring that
out into the real world

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.350 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a hundred
million other people who

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:45.220 align:middle line:84%
are exuberant about
the very same thing

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and are tired of
having stomach aches

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and are tired of spending
their weekend drunk

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.930 align:middle line:90%
watching television.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And that resonance
takes-- remember,

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.810 align:middle line:84%
this is a cosmos
becoming aware of itself.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The more of these
threads of resonance,

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.500 align:middle line:84%
the more of these
threads of exuberance

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that we bring to the
common human enterprise,

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.130 align:middle line:84%
the more we grow that
collective brain.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And that collective brain
isn't just stodgy gray stuff.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It is built on exuberance,
passion, and energy.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And Miki, what have
you've learned so far

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
about entrepreneurialism
and what has to change

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and what is changing?

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.005 align:middle line:84%
I think the future
of entrepreneurship

00:51:21.005 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:90%
has to have a social element.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It has to be social
entrepreneurship.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Because people who start a
glass company for the sake

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:10%
of starting a glass company is
going to get bored, especially

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.950 align:middle line:10%
the millennial generation,
the next generation

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.721 align:middle line:10%
of people who have
just information

00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:10%
at their fingertips.
They're just, like, so ADD.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're interested in
so many different things.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I think what will
carry somebody forward

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the
one project at hand

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is if that they're
solving a global problem

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:90%
there's a real mission to it.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And you get up every day
wanting to make that change

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:48.830 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to get bored doing it.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's women's issues.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled every day
just to work on it.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
how many pain-in-the-butt

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.380 align:middle line:84%
manufacturing issues that
we're going through right now.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And just customer service,
whatever, you know?

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.710 align:middle line:84%
That mission is going to
continue to drive me forward.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for
the future as well,

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and I think because there's
just so much noise in the world

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's just
being advertised

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to in every different
possible way,

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going to get
people to really resonate

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.100 align:middle line:84%
with a brand is a
message and a message

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.224 align:middle line:90%
that's beyond just the product.

00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:25.090 align:middle line:90%
AMBER LASCIAK: Definitely.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:25.837 align:middle line:84%
So yeah.
Right?

00:52:25.837 --> 00:52:27.270 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Amber,
what do you think?

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think there's
an infinite-- I mean,

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.630 align:middle line:90%
you can see it in both of you.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.660 align:middle line:84%
There's just an infinite
amount of energy

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can resource
when you're passionate.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
There's just no
question about it.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And passion, I mean, for me, in
this particular sense, I mean,

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:43.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a real deviation
from what I was doing.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But you know you're a
New Yorker and you're

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:90%
seeing all this waste.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.461 align:middle line:84%
And it's painful.
-Right.

00:52:47.461 --> 00:52:49.161 align:middle line:10%
It's painful.
-It's painful.

00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:49.860 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.810 align:middle line:10%
And you-- well, OK, you've
made it clear that waste

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:56.630 align:middle line:10%
is also-- I mean, but I
agree, which CO2, it's like,

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.350 align:middle line:10%
it's also a fuel.
-Right.

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:90%
But of course.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when people are
throwing things away,

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:07.540 align:middle line:84%
it's very-- you know,
that source of pain

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.560 align:middle line:90%
is a source of passion.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So I just-- it
doesn't-- you're right.

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I feel like I have
infinite amounts of energy.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:84%
There's just no--
you can't stop me.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.692 align:middle line:84%
Because Hurricane
Sandy was a very--

00:53:18.692 --> 00:53:20.072 align:middle line:90%
Six feet of water, right now.

00:53:20.072 --> 00:53:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Ugh, we had six feet of water.

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And there we were--

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.704 align:middle line:84%
They were in Red Hook, which
was particularly hard hit.

00:53:24.704 --> 00:53:26.070 align:middle line:84%
AMBER LASCIAK: We were
in Red Hook, yeah.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had-- we were
two weeks from opening.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And we had 5 and 1/2 feet of
water come through our space.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was really beyond.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing was then

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.270 align:middle line:84%
there was all these volunteers
who came to help us.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.864 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
that is it's the most--

00:53:45.864 --> 00:53:47.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the most trying things
you could ever go through.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Because you're in a crisis.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's here we were.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- it was, like,
a very meta experience.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We were salvaging salvage.
You know?

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.595 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I'm
like, this-- this--

00:53:58.595 --> 00:53:59.525 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's so meta.

00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:01.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:90%
So true.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.510 align:middle line:84%
This had been
thrown away already.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And now, here-- here we are.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And these incredible volunteers,
here they are, helping

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.341 align:middle line:84%
scrub down this broken chair.
You know?

00:54:12.341 --> 00:54:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.275 align:middle line:84%
And it's like--
and the passion had

00:54:15.275 --> 00:54:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to like-- we had to like-- I
was constantly, like, I care

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.570 align:middle line:90%
about not throwing this away.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.661 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much waste that
was created in the Hurricane.

00:54:22.661 --> 00:54:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It was beyond.

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the fun thing
is is that in Red Hook,

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.780 align:middle line:84%
we did-- I did go around
and salvage the things,

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.580 align:middle line:84%
like the metals and the
things that I knew that we

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:90%
could sterilize and stuff.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.345 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
people in Red Hook

00:54:34.345 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:84%
are going to see those
things in a beautiful,

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.830 align:middle line:84%
new re-imagined state.
You know?

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I think it's just--
I think capitalism, I think is--

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:84%
it's destined-- if we find the
passion and the things that--

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:84%
instead of-- yeah, and beyond
the object, as you were saying,

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:84%
beyond the product
that you're making,

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.830 align:middle line:84%
if it's-- maybe you're
trying to make a change,

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.510 align:middle line:90%
like, a mind shift basically.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Then I think it's--

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something
you-- you brought up

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that is incredibly
important when

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:10.050 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about redoing
things, which is your theme.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:11.345 align:middle line:84%
And it is radical
you're perceiving.

00:55:11.345 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I have a book called "The
Genius of the Beast--"

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.860 align:middle line:84%
A Radical Reperception--
"A Radical

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Revision of Capitalism."
and it is about the fact

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can take something
that looks like a curse

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into a
resource if you see

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:90%
the wonder and the awe in it.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting down
with an au pair

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
one day, who had just
graduated from the Sorbonne.

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And she graduated
in 17th century

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.680 align:middle line:90%
or 18th century furniture.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And at first that seemed
like a total waste.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, here
she is in New York City.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:48.706 align:middle line:84%
She's a short distance from
57th Street and Madison Avenue.

00:55:48.706 --> 00:55:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, 57th Street
and Madison Avenue,

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of antique stuff.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:57.120 align:middle line:84%
She can walk into any gallery,
look at the furniture,

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and tell you the story
of that furniture.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and its history, yeah.

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can sell more than
just the piece of furniture.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:03.710 align:middle line:90%
The story.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can sell the story,
then, all of a sudden,

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you've given the
person who buys that

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:12.920 align:middle line:90%
a gift of an incalculable gift.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Because what do we
really buy things for?

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't just buy a
chair to sit down on it.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We buy a chair because this was
the chair made by the cabinet

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.740 align:middle line:90%
maker to Louis the XIV.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And he invented a
technique of overlaying

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:90%
15 different kinds of veneers.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.290 align:middle line:84%
He was capable of
doing that because

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of a bunch of new technologies
that had just come into play

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and because there was an
aristocratic class that

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.075 align:middle line:90%
was willing to pay for them.

00:56:38.075 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole story there.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you can tell the story,
that chair isn't just a chair.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That chair is a way of
connecting with your friends.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of showing off.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of getting attention.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And we don't just buy things
for their practical use.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We buy them for the
attention that they

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.470 align:middle line:90%
will buy us from our friends.

00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And how do we get attention?

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Waking up their
eyes, getting them

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.940 align:middle line:90%
to see the wonder in things.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, because
things have value.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- you
put something--

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.020 align:middle line:84%
like, you want to hear a
little story about this desk?

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was rescued
from a Lafayette basement

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.660 align:middle line:84%
where they were throwing
everything away.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And the plexi on
the side-- I mean,

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:18.950 align:middle line:84%
everything, obviously
was whatever

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:21.750 align:middle line:84%
materials we had rescued was
what we were able to use.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But the plexi came
from-- there was

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.630 align:middle line:84%
a-- we did a huge dumpster
dive, which I think

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:28.990 align:middle line:84%
is sort of illegal
at this point.

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:32.040 align:middle line:90%
But it was sort of before.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell anyone.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:36.160 align:middle line:90%
So but the plexi--

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And you were on
LSD at the time.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:37.856 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:57:37.856 --> 00:57:39.230 align:middle line:90%
AMBER LASCIAK: Oh.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:40.010 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.435 align:middle line:84%
But the plexi was-- there was
a place called Cinemagic who

00:57:47.435 --> 00:57:49.690 align:middle line:84%
was-- that was moving to
Brooklyn because the rents are

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:50.890 align:middle line:90%
so high in Manhattan.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving
all their stuff away.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's just, it's true.

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we're
definitely after the story.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.435 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
stories already.

00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, just with,
like, every piece,

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of where it comes from and why.

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
someone who's giving,

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, who's
grandma just died.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's-- you
know, it's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- it is--
it's true, the story.

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think, more than
anything, it's value.

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's that-- for me, at
least personally, it's like,

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, things
have to have value.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And that-- and things and people
and everything on the planet

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is about-- it's,
like, a value system.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't see the value
in CO2, if we don't-- you know,

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:32.640 align:middle line:90%
here I am trying to fight it.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
it's a great thing.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.465 align:middle line:84%
Right?
But it's like--

00:58:34.465 --> 00:58:35.360 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
I mean, I just want

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.393 align:middle line:90%
to change the subject a little.

00:58:36.393 --> 00:58:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think that
yes, it's about value.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But in some ways, the
value system of capitalism

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.840 align:middle line:90%
still seems very screwed up.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Especially if we think about
income, economic inequality.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.750 align:middle line:84%
That we have a small
percentage of the populous

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:52.980 align:middle line:84%
who are getting
extraordinary control

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's
resources compared

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to almost everybody else?

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And we also see, in
terms of a charity

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.430 align:middle line:84%
or social entrepreneurship,
that sometimes it's a veneer.

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Like people are,
kind of philanthropy

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.470 align:middle line:84%
can be just giving
back enough to kind

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of act as, like, a
steam valve which keeps

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.820 align:middle line:90%
society from going haywire.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Does that require
something that's

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:14.920 align:middle line:84%
more of a kind of
structural reform

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.917 align:middle line:90%
in the capitalist system?

00:59:15.917 --> 00:59:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that people are going

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:84%
to bring about through protest
or are we going to end up

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.640 align:middle line:84%
with a society that's
ever more kind of have

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and have not split?

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think everyone
should just take mushrooms

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and oh, we'll solve the world.

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I actually did have
a dream about that.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:36.930 align:middle line:84%
If, like, all world leaders
took mushrooms then we would all

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:38.630 align:middle line:84%
realize that we're all
one on the same planet

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and it just-- just
like, the borders

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.590 align:middle line:90%
are created by people marching.

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.455 align:middle line:90%
And it's just so weird.

00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we're all
humans on one planet.

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And some are marching
in private jets.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:49.071 align:middle line:84%
And others are still, you know,
living in low-income housing.

00:59:49.071 --> 00:59:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:50.991 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
Ameritocracy though.

00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:51.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:54.260 align:middle line:84%
My father came to America
with $5 in his pocket.

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And in one generation
he put three

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.010 align:middle line:90%
kids trough Ivy League schools.

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:59.650 align:middle line:10%
And you know, yes
he was educated.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But at this-- you
know-- he-- he grew up

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.670 align:middle line:84%
in a small town in
India where his parents

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.010 align:middle line:90%
sold saris in Benares.

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
anyone's been to India.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's a beautiful,
magical town.

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.499 align:middle line:90%
But again, like I said--

01:00:11.499 --> 01:00:12.732 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it people
there are people

01:00:12.732 --> 01:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
who have equal amounts of
gumption and enthusiasm

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:90%
who just don't make it?

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Who fall through the cracks?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
little bit of a kind

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of-- like, even, we went to Utah
and the Summit thing together.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And one critique of Summit
is that there's a kind

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of Ayn Randian undertone to it.

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:28.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's like, all the
other people who have made it,

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
living on a mountain,
congratulating themselves

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.935 align:middle line:90%
on how awesome they've become.

01:00:33.935 --> 01:00:35.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I truly believe that if
everyone worked really as hard

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
as they should-- they
could, then they can

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
truly achieve what they want.
I believe that.

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
about work ethic.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
People are like, oh
I worked really hard

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:48.915 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

01:00:48.915 --> 01:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you were,
like, passed out by 8:00.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.119 align:middle line:84%
Like, no.
You know?

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, how
badly do you want it?

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
You will find a way.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, I mean, I had no business
opening a little pizza shop

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
in New York City with zero
experience, not Italian,

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and no any-- like, nothing.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Right, but it could be there's
a number of people who just,

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
the brakes didn't-- they
picked the wrong spot.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Or there wasn't the foot
traffic or something changed.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:15.104 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a little bit
of a kind of-- for me-- for me,

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that's suspicious in
terms of kind of almost

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:17.667 align:middle line:90%
like a libertarian edge to it.

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Howard?

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that Thomas Alva
Edison was absolutely right

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and that most people
give up too soon.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I agree with Miki, that most
people give up on the 999 try.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And the thousandth try is
the try that would make it.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That they've taken 999 steps
to getting where they're going.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And that every failure is a
lesson in how to get further.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And the people who think
that the good life is all

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.245 align:middle line:84%
about getting drunk
on the weekend

01:01:48.245 --> 01:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and passing out while
watching a football game,

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
those people are
defeating themselves.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Those people are creating
income inequality.

01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, taking this
incredible, thriving biosphere

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
of which we are a part
and growing it constantly

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.590 align:middle line:90%
is a matter of productivity.

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And productivity comes
from the kind of zest

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
in the things you really believe
it that these two people are

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
showing, plus an
element we never

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.060 align:middle line:90%
talk about in American society.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Undying, unending
persistence, putting yourself

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
through the 999
incredibly painful

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.870 align:middle line:84%
failures to get to the point
where your passions payoff.

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Amber, what do you think?
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
-Well--
-Yeah.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I think one
thing, maybe, that we also

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
have in common is that
we had a health issue

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.200 align:middle line:90%
and we overcame it.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.165 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the-- I
think that requires a hell

01:02:46.165 --> 01:02:47.890 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of determination.

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:51.611 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and-- you know--
-Persistence.

01:02:51.611 --> 01:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:55.105 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- for me, you
know-- and its vitality.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It's your vitality.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think once you learn that
with that much persistence

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:03.344 align:middle line:84%
that you can make
a change like that,

01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really--
that's a very-- because that's

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
about self-healing.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- and you're
saying there's no such

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
thing as the self because we are
part of a whole and the other.

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you learn that
you can heal yourself,

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
it's an incredibly
valuable lesson.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.351 align:middle line:84%
In mean, you lost 15
years of your life.

01:03:19.351 --> 01:03:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But to follow up on
what you're saying,

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
America has a huge
population of people

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
who are handicapped in the
way that we do not perceive.

01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
They're handicapped
because things have

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.470 align:middle line:90%
always come too easy to them.

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And because things
have come easy

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.261 align:middle line:84%
they haven't learned
how to persist.

01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Discipline.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They haven't learned
the discipline.

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is a severe
and appalling handicap,

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
not just for the individuals
who suffer from it,

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but for the society on
which they are drag.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And discipline is one
of those beautiful things

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I think you can-- really.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about-- it ends up
being about love or self love.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's about making
something from nothing.

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:01.257 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also pa--
it's filled with passion.

01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Which again, here
we're talking about

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:07.000 align:middle line:10%
the fundamental-- the basis of a
healthy capitalist environment.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, these are the things
that I think will really--

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
will really make a
change if we have

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:13.570 align:middle line:90%
a mind shift in that direction.

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back to a word
that you were using, Daniel.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.200 align:middle line:10%
The most important word
in economics is value.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you will find 200 years
worth of analysis of what value

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.570 align:middle line:84%
is in terms of mathematics
and in terms of Ricardo

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of
Marx and all kinds

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.390 align:middle line:90%
of complex abstract stuff.

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Value is not an abstraction.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Value is a passion.

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Value is an emotion.

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Value is desire.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.120 align:middle line:90%
AMBER LASCIAK: Compassion.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And desire is at the very
heart of what motivated you

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and what motivated you and
what I've seen motivate you

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
for the 12 or 15 years
that I've known you,

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and what motivates
everybody in this room.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We have the engine of
an economy in our gut.

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.604 align:middle line:90%
And go with the passion.

01:05:04.604 --> 01:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
AMBER LASCIAK: Absolutely.

01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:06.508 align:middle line:90%
But value-- you can--

01:05:06.508 --> 01:05:08.420 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.093 align:middle line:84%
We have to close
this up in a minute.

01:05:10.093 --> 01:05:11.288 align:middle line:90%
we're at the end of our time.

01:05:11.288 --> 01:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys want to make
one last little succinct

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
delirious comment, exuberant
comment in delirium?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the
two of these guys

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.476 align:middle line:90%
are so gorgeous it's ridiculous.

01:05:21.476 --> 01:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what they're
achieving is beyond belief.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the achievement
of this show and watching you

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
build an empire of
the mind-- which

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
you've been building for 10
years-- has been incredible.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And we need more of it.
-Yeah.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:35.862 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:39.159 align:middle line:90%


01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody's
wish in the world

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is to have the light
turned on in their eyes.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
When you see people on
Facebook and they're like, ugh,

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:48.420 align:middle line:90%
it's Monday.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You're like, make
a change right now.

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And you can.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just the mystery of
life is that you never

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
know when it's going to end.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.177 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to sort
of figure out what to do

01:05:58.177 --> 01:05:59.210 align:middle line:90%
to turn the light on your eyes.

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.240 align:middle line:90%
You just have to.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of
what my book's about.

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Although you're saying
there's not going to be an end.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.525 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking
forward to that too.

01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Our job in life is
to triumph to the best

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
extent of our ability.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And Andrew Marvel,
the poet, put it

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.520 align:middle line:90%
best in "To His Coy Mistress."

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's take all of
our joys, all of our passions,

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
roll them up into one ball.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.931 align:middle line:84%
And roll them with "rough
strife through the iron

01:06:20.931 --> 01:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
gates of life."
And here's the key line.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
"Thus, though we cannot
make our sun stand still,

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
yet we will make him run."

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Thus, though we cannot
actually stop death,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
we will get so much
out of every second

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.146 align:middle line:84%
of life that we will say,
[BLEEP] you to the Grim Reaper.

01:06:37.146 --> 01:06:39.841 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:40.839 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.839 --> 01:06:43.334 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, thank you
very much, guys, for joining me.

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And hope to have you all back.

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And [INAUDIBLE].
Thank you so much.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:49.050 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%


01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:54.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:08.134 align:middle line:90%
