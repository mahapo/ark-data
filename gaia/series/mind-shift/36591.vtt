00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.580 align:middle line:10%
Today we're on the
show "Mind Shift"

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.630 align:middle line:10%
talking with Richard
Dolan, who asks

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.330 align:middle line:10%
is there an extraterrestrial
presence in our world?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:84%
If so, what form does
this actually take?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Based on his years
of study, Dolan

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.085 align:middle line:84%
believes that ETs
actually exist that are

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
in contact with elements of what
he calls a "secret government."

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:84%
This elite group may constitute
what Dolan likes to call

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:90%
a breakaway civilization.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
He believes they've developed
super futuristic technology,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is able to access
zero point energy,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps travel
to other worlds.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
George Hansen is the
author of "The Trickster

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and the Paranormal."

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
In his work, Hansen looks at
the idea of the trickster,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
this idea of liminal
experiences that

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
cross between our
usual distinctions

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
between subjective and
objective, real and imaginary,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
true and false.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Is our whole paradigm
for understanding

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the nature of
reality on the verge

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.037 align:middle line:90%
of changing on us yet again?

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:25.191 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
Hi, everybody.

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:10%
Welcome "Mind Shift."
I'm your host, Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:10%
Today, our first guest is
the amazing UFOlogist Richard

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Dolan.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.685 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of the
two volume history, UFOs

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and National Security State,
Chronology of a Cover-up"

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and "AD, at your Disclosure,
the People's Guide to Life

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:90%
After Contact."

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
On this show, we're gonna
be asking the questions,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
is there a secret government
that has developed

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:90%
hyper futuristic technologies?

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Is there an ET
presence in our world?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And also, what does it mean
if so, and why should we care?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll stay with us,
and enjoy this amazing episode.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.287 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

NARRATOR: Among the
world's leading historians

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of
UFOs, Richard Dolan

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:10%
is the author of "UFOs and
the National Security State,"

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:10%
volumes one and two, and
"AD, After Disclosure,

Finally Reveals

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:10%
the Truth About Alien Contact."

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:10%
He's the host of the Richard
Dolan Show on KGRA Radio

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:10%
every Saturday,
and a regular guest

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:10%
on Coast to Coast AM Radio.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Through his work, he poses
important questions, such as,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
what does a UFO presence
mean for our civilization,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
why the cover-up up will
end within our lifetime,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and what will happen
after it is exposed.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Be on the lookout for his
new, groundbreaking work,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.682 align:middle line:84%
"UFOs for the 21st
Century Mind."

00:02:38.682 --> 00:02:40.594 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So, Richard, thank you so much
for joining me on the show.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Daniel, thanks for having me.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your work.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
extraordinary, just

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:90%
the depth of it and everything.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could just give us
a brief summary of what you've

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
done, and what your
current state of thinking

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is around the ET presence.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.869 align:middle line:84%
Sure.
Well, yes.

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I fell-- I like I think
I fell into this field

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:90%
about 20 years ago.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Back then, I was working
on a doctoral dissertation

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.375 align:middle line:10%
in US Cold War studies.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:10%
It had nothing to do with flying
saucers, or UFOs, or aliens.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that one
does in the academic world,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
typically, but I
became obsessed.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
other word for it.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I came across some UFO books
that intrigued me, that dealt

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
with the early
Cold War, which was

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.379 align:middle line:84%
the period that I was really
immersed in at that time.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.845 align:middle line:84%
You've gone through
masses of documentation

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%
around the whole subject.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So basically my entry
went into the phase of,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:84%
let's find out if
there's anything to this.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
know as a historian

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and someone who studies
archives, what's the evidence?

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And that really just
took me into this field.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought initially that I would
spend three or four months.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean truly researching this
to solve the riddle for myself.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it just pulled
me right into the rabbit hole,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and I've been there ever since.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your
perspective, there definitely

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
has been some type of secret
government connections

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:90%
to an ET presence, or?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I would say so.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, I had to be pulled to
that conclusion by degrees.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Back in the old days, I did not
believe it was possible to have

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.957 align:middle line:90%
a truly grand conspiracy.

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, you could have
a lot of little conspiracies,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's always
corruption and so forth.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But what really drew me to that
conclusion was simply that what

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
became evident was that through
the brief window in time when

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
we actually had a reasonably
good freedom of information

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
act that allowed us to
get declassified documents

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
from our government, we
have those documents here

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
in the public domain
now, and what they

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.735 align:middle line:90%
proof is not that UFOs are ET.

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't prove
that UFOs are alien,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
but it does prove,
I argue strongly,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that there is a phenomenon
that our military

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and our intelligence
community has been engaged in,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
has been covering up, and
that has concerned them.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's concerned them.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And I say this because we have
case after case of violations

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of highly sensitive
airspace over the years

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
by objects that, frankly, are
not supposed to have existed,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.165 align:middle line:84%
that are not supposed to exist
to this day, that things that

00:04:58.165 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:90%
are not supposed to be possible.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
That is disk-shaped
objects that hover

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
silently, take off
instantly, zigzag,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and all the other things.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And these were events that
concerned-- I mean anyone who'd

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
be concerned with an
air base or an army base

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
would obviously be
concerned about this,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and they certainly were.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time that they're
telling the public, nothing

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to see, keep moving along,
clearly this was something

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
that was concerning them.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:90%
So that was the hook.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you add up all of
those disparate documents,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and you group them
together, what you see

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
is that this is a big, big, big,
thing, whatever this thing is.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
deserves public discourse

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.034 align:middle line:84%
in our broader
community so we can

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
at least find out what it is.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.837 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's a narrative
around objects that

00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:90%
have been appearing in the sky.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.336 align:middle line:84%
And so what about more
the idea that there's

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
been direct ET human contact,
even on an official or secretly

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
official level?
-All right.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going into
a combination logic

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and, let's say,
leaks and inference.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you assume,
as I have now done,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that there are actual physical
objects that have been tracked

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and seen, visually seen,
tracked on radar, and all of it,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
so they belong to
somebody, presumably.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't belong
to the Soviets,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and if they don't at least
all seem to belong to us,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
then there's this other,
whoever this other is.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:90%
So I do work on that assumption.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the best one
that I can make at this time.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, beyond that, you have
claims, some of them seemingly

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
very credible to me,
of individuals who

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
have had contact with
non-human entities

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:90%
in one form or another.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all of that
mass, that database, let's say.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you have,
I guess what we

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
can say would be leaks, unproven
claims, these that don't come

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
out of US National Archives,
but nonetheless are individuals

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
with relatively high
level of background

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
within the government
who have made

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
certain types of
statements that, yes

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%
there's a presence here.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
They are here,
and there has been

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.562 align:middle line:84%
some level of communication
between us and them.

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And what about then-- I
mean, from my understanding

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
of your work, you
then hypothesize

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is some type
of secret government,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe even what you call
a breakaway civilization.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think first of all
with the secret government,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to ask myself, back
in my much more naive days,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, if I write
the best possible history,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and I just nail it, and I
get all of my facts lined up,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and I make an unanswerable
argument, then, well of course,

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I would help to end this
secrecy on the topic.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course it didn't
work out that way.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:90%
You start studying the media.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
You start studying our
academic community,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:90%
our scientific community.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
is that there's

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of control
over those institutions

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in many important ways.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up
asking myself, well,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
what is the actual
structure of power?

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Are these institutions
truly independent or not?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
If they're not, then
who's in control?

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Is the US government
and independent entity?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Is the President
the guy in charge?

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, turns out, no.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so a parallel
area of my study

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
has been to try to understand
the true structure of power

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there an international
power structure, for example?

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And does that include
a secret government?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I would argue we have what we
could call a secret government.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.477 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it
functions in what

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
we would call our black budget
world, that is the world

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:90%
of special access programs.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody mentioned to me the
other day that, apparently,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
on September 10th 2001,
$2 trillion were announced

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
just missing from the Pentagon?

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a
statement by Secretary

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he'd initially
made the statement in July

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
of '01, and then remade
that statement, that's true,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
on September 10,
2001, indicating that

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
there was $2.3 trillion
in transactions

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
that were not accounted for.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That was his word.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the very
next day, boom.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes crazy.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Including, though, the
Pentagon was hit by a missile

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in a particular area.
Is that right?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
That was the argument made
by Jim Mars, actually.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people know Jim.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have not been able to
independently confirm that,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.054 align:middle line:90%
but that was this argument.

00:09:06.054 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:90%
He's an excellent researcher.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But they'd knocked out
the computer that had

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:90%
managed all those transactions?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I think that's right.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
in years hence,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:90%
this is almost-- it's funny.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It would be funny if
it weren't so tragic.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
It's that Dov Zakheim, I
believe that's his name.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
He was in charge of resolving
this discrepancy years later.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think in by '05,
'06, they said, yes.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We've worked out
the discrepancies,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and we got it down to zero.
-Mhm.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, I mean think about this.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:90%
From 2.3 to 0?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I could see them getting it
down to maybe half a trillion.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some general at the
top said, get that down to zero.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there is
a bunch of money,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of money that's
going into something or other.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it going into?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's
presume for a moment

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that something like a UFO
crash retrieval occurred.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Just pretend it happened.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that such
things did happen.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a very good
case to be made for that.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you did acquire some kind
of highly exotic technology

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
back in the 1940s,
what would you do?

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
A, you wouldn't tell the world
about it, because then you'd

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.085 align:middle line:84%
have to begin the
process of sharing

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:90%
that technology with the world.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at the top
of this human pyramid,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't wanna do that.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So you would need to
study it privately.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You would need to have
a complete clandestine

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure to do that.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
You would have to spend money
not simply for R&D, which would

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
be expensive, let's
face it, but also

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
for the security,
which would probably

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:90%
be much more expensive.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of money.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't just go
through Congress

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
for the appropriations,
because that gives it away.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have to create
a clandestine, not only

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure, but
funding process.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And you need a lot of money.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying all of
that money goes into ET,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
exotic technology, research, but
I suspect that some of it does.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that we're
engaged in some larger

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.485 align:middle line:90%
cosmic narrative or drama?

00:10:47.485 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a cosmic war that
involves extraterrestrials,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
off-planet beings?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do you think is
the larger saga or significant

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good question.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Look, the short answer
is, I don't know.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anybody truly knows.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people like
to say that they know,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not
necessarily persuaded

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.675 align:middle line:90%
that they actually do.

00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:07.875 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something happening,

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and if you want to
put together all

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of the pieces of this puzzle,
it looks, to me anyway,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that there are a
number of groups,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
let's just put it in
that term, that are

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:90%
here for their own purposes.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I look at it logically.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I look at humanity as we
are right now at this point

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
in history, and we're about to
leap into some new dimension

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.217 align:middle line:90%
of our own existence.

00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about
Steven Greer's argument,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.485 align:middle line:84%
that if you had an
extraterrestrial civilization

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that had developed hyper
futuristic technologies way

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
beyond where we're
at, they would almost

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
have to be benevolent, because
otherwise those technologies

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
would be so destructive we
wouldn't see stars out there,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.641 align:middle line:84%
we would just see bunches
of rubble and gas clouds.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I dunno.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.606 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's a
certain logic to it,

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:10%
but there's a certain kind
of naivety about it as well.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:10%
Look, if we were to go back in
time to some prehistoric era

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:10%
or pre-modern era, we could
impress the native people there

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.451 align:middle line:10%
with our great technology,
and our nice clothing,

00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:10%
and everything else.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And they would say, wow.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You guys have really figured
out all of your problems.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You probably have
solved the problems

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:90%
of hunger and everything else.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And we would look at
each other and not

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
say much to these people.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a fallacy
to say that very advanced

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
technology equates
to a very, very

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:90%
benign spiritual development.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, the United States
today has the most advanced

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
military in the world,
and we don't particularly

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
play nice with our neighbors.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis in their era
had some of the most

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
advanced technology, ditto.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's entirely
possible that you could have,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
let's say, an interstellar
economic hitman

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:90%
species that would exist.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
they're here to destroy us,

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:90%
but they could be here to use.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Use for what?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.966 align:middle line:84%
-What their purposes might be?
-Entertainment?

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.431 align:middle line:84%
Food?
-Yeah, I dunno.

00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I remember speaking with
the late Ingo Swann one time.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had an experience
where he was observing

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
a craft draw huge amounts
of water out of this lake

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:90%
somewhere up in Alaska.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked by
this gentleman, well,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:84%
what were your
impressions of that craft?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And after Ingo calmed
down, he said, look,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that's we're
their supermarket.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
They said, let's just to go
to Earth, and grab some water,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
grab some DNA,
grab some whatever.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:90%
What's the use?

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
asked me this question.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
What's the use of getting
involved, enmeshed

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
in this level of understanding?

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it actually
just depress people?

00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a way that we need
to know about this, that it

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
could help us in some way?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
What can we do about it?

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if we were to discover
there was a secret government

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that had a breakaway
civilization that had developed

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.235 align:middle line:84%
hyper futuristic free energy,
inter-dimensional travel,

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.854 align:middle line:90%
what it would mean to us?

00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a topic that
people have to be careful with.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this many, many times.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I've seen brilliant people
get into this topic,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they
go through a crisis.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you go through your
life up to certain point,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.237 align:middle line:90%
thinking I'm ahead of the curve.

00:13:47.237 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I've got it all figured out.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, here's this
entirely different reality.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And it is distressing.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:90%
It can be distressing to people.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, you wanna
be strong, psychologically.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be flexible
in your outlook about things.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:90%
But why would someone do it?

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.984 align:middle line:90%
And why does this matter?

00:14:02.984 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:90%
It matters for a lot of reasons.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
A, on an existential level,
if there are these others who

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
are here, for whatever reason,
whether benign or not benign,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that's important for a
thinking, philosophically

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
inclined person, who cares
about the meaning of their life.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I think any rational
and reasonable

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:90%
person would wanna do that.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, on a political level, I
think it matters a great deal.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's imperative
that we as a society

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
hold our government
accountable to the truth.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I see all too frequently
people saying,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, it doesn't matter if the
government discloses or not

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It matters what
we think about it.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:90%
That's true in a way.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It matters very much what we,
the people, think about this.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But dammit, we don't
wanna give up holding

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.074 align:middle line:90%
our government accountable.

00:14:44.074 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to be a
society with a government

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:90%
accountable to us.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.595 align:middle line:84%
So Obama, normal human
being, or some kind

00:14:48.595 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:90%
of alien implant intervention?

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's say in between.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
I think he's a human being.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And like anyone at the top
of our power structure,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
is very intimately handled.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
No one just gets to
that position by chance.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.876 align:middle line:90%
That never happens.

00:15:02.876 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We have people that are
selected, not elected.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was with Obama, and
that was with Bush before,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and that was with Clinton
before him, and so on.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
He did seem like the
absolutely perfect, just

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
in terms of his looks, and--

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Totally perfect.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
He is the perfect man
to sell brand America

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about the future

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:90%
and the Disclosure Project.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you've been
involved with the movement

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
towards disclosure.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you talk
about all this other stuff,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and these different
levels of secrecy and son,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.544 align:middle line:84%
you think disclosure is
something that is actually

00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
gonna happen in a public way,
or is it really something that's

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.991 align:middle line:84%
just happening almost in a
private and individual way,

00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:90%
in a sense?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, first the latter,
then the former.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is,
I was dragged into

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:90%
the whole disclosure movement.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
initially just jump in.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But because I write
in a political way,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it was natural
that I went that way.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
What I think is gonna
happen is disclosure

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is gonna be a very
messy process,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:90%
but it's an inevitable process.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I think if simply you look at
the trajectory of our society,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
you look where we are
today compared with even 20

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
years ago, let
alone 50 years ago,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
we're moving along like a
rocket into some future.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
We're 20 years away from your
laptop or your personal device

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
talking to you maybe as a
conscious, sentient entity

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not sentient in the
way we are, but in some way.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We're reinventing ourselves.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:90%
We've mapped the genome.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.605 align:middle line:84%
We're on the edge of incredible
nanotech and everything else.

00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:90%
We're decoding reality.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're recreating
some new reality now.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So to look at our
society 20 years from now

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
is gonna be a very
different experience

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:90%
from what we have today.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think in that
type of situation,

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
some form of reality
on this topic

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
is going to be out in the open.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
What I think is happening is
that at the groundswell level,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the people,
there's change happening.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I think we can see this.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And that will, in
one way or another,

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:84%
force the government to
make some kind of statement,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're
gonna be forced to.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.661 align:middle line:84%
They're never gonna do this
out of the benefit for people.

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They'll do this when
there's no other way.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was an interesting
statement from the Vatican,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.229 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Where they talked
about how astronomers

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:90%
said that there may be ET races.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And if so, they would never
have to convert to Catholicism,

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
because they wouldn't have
committed original sin?

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:90%
Oh, right, right, right.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:90%
I remember this, yeah.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's an interesting
statement, isn't it?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what to make of that?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's interesting
that elements

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
high up within the
Catholic church

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
have, over the last decade,
been making a few of these types

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of statements that are different
from that of other versions

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian religion.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
certainly a little

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:90%
further ahead on this curve.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's evidence
that there's different strata

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or types of extraterrestrials?

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:58.075 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people talk about
the grays, the Pleiadians.

00:17:58.075 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I've seen channelers
who claim to bring

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
in extra-dimensional beings
from other worlds who

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:90%
seem to be helpful.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think there's
a whole cosmic ecology?

00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think it's entirely,
I would say, not impossible,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.887 align:middle line:90%
but probably likely.

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:90%
You've used the word--

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
-Probably like you, also.
-Right.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, right?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
You've used the word
liminal a few times.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very apt
word for this field.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
field of ufology

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
does, and it's only one
subset of this larger

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
alternative reality that
all of us are exploring,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
we're near a limit of what our
where our consciousness is at.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this field is taking

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:84%
us right to the edge of what
we're almost able to grab,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why, look,
a lot of things

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
relating to this
phenomenon really

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
don't make sense
on a logical basis.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're talking
about human technology,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
or non-human technology, or
even in inter-dimensional,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:84%
there's certain things that are
involved in this field that,

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to our allegedly rational
minds, don't quite make sense

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and some of the behaviors.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.236 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we're bumping
into is a reality-- you know,

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
you think of different
levels of creatures.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
You think from insects
to a dog and to a human.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So an insect perceives certain
limited kinds of reality.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Your dog can perceive much more.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.445 align:middle line:84%
Your dog knows who you
are, and your dog knows

00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:23.597 align:middle line:90%
where its food is and so on.

00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But your dog doesn't
know what the moon is.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.063 align:middle line:84%
It can sense you telepathically
too when you're coming home.

00:19:27.063 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have a dog, and
I absolutely believe it.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But a dog doesn't really
know what the moon is.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Your dog doesn't know what a
city is, because the dog can't

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So here we are a little
higher up, but what's here?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
concepts-- I mean,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
our brains are set up
to perceive reality

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:90%
spatially and temporally.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's just how we work.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as
we now understand it

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
non-locality in physics,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
time and space
really aren't what

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:90%
our common sense says anyway.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're bumping up into kind
of a natural biological limit,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:90%
I think, of where we could be.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And those limits
can be expanded.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe this, but
nonetheless it's--

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
-It's a work in progress.
-That's right.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.417 align:middle line:84%
Last question, because
we're about to take a break,

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and bring on our next
guest, George Hansen,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and then bring you back to
have a dialogue with them.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But I'm curious
what kind of advice

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
you would give to
all the poor people

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
out there who are seeking
to make some sense of this,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and there are all
these websites.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
There's the Cassiopaeans
and the Pleiadians.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
How do people bring
discernment to this field?

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Two critical things.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
One is, you have to become
conversant with being

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:90%
able to do your research.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.633 align:middle line:84%
If you're not willing to do
your own research, that is,

00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
if you're not willing
to investigate,

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
then I would almost
say, don't even bother.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And that means, when there's
a claim that you encounter,

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
learn how to do at
least basic web searches

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
to get to the source of a
particular claim, or source

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.511 align:middle line:84%
a particular image that comes
into your mailbox, a JPEG

00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:84%
image.
There are ways of doing this.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.964 align:middle line:84%
These are tools that are
available to anybody.

00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:04.663 align:middle line:90%
In other words--

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Just to push back
for one second.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.631 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I was
fascinated by the carrot stuff

00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:84%
with that guy Isaac.
-Yeah.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But then you read conflicting
claims that it's all trash.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
This guy Isaac claimed that he
worked for a secret government

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
program reverse
engineering technology

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:90%
that corporations had sponsored.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he had images
of the technology,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and the sort of signals that
were on the pieces, and so on.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think I'm actually
more persuaded them

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:90%
not by the legitimacy of that.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.697 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are certainly
a lot of criticisms,

00:21:35.697 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
obviously, saying
that's it's all bogus.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't feel that
that's actually the case.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I studied those
documents in some detail.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I will say that
he reads exactly,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
exactly right,
for Silicon Valley

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%
early 1980s defense industry.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It looks exactly right to me.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And the criticisms of the
images that they were not--

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So essentially
what you're saying

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
to be-- if you want

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
to really investigate
this realm,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
there's no other
authority but oneself,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.375 align:middle line:84%
because there really
isn't another litmus test.

00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:10%
Yourself, provided
that you adhere

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:10%
to certain basic, fundamental
rules of investigation

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
that any journalist should
know, or any trained

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:10%
person would know, like how
to go to the original source.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's not infallible.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.924 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is, really.

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
that I would recommend

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
is simply learn to
be a little bit more

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with uncertainty.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.435 align:middle line:84%
It is not necessary that
we come to firm conclusions

00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:84%
about every single
one of these things.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that
we're not going to know,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and you've gotta be
comfortable with that,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and be prepared to have
your reality shifted.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Right on.
Cool.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Richard.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's so awesome to talk
to you about this stuff.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
You're a great,
level-headed voice

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and presence in this area.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're gonna take a break,
and come right back with George

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Hansen, and then we'll bring
Richard and George together

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.938 align:middle line:90%
for the dialogue.

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.674 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Known for his
work, "The Trickster

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Paranormal,"
George P Hanson is

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
a writer and parapsychologist.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.465 align:middle line:10%
He's active in a number
of psychic, UFO, and New

00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:10%
Age organizations,
and was professionally

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:10%
employed in parapsychology
laboratories for eight years.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:10%
During that time, he
conducted many experiments

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:10%
in the field of remote viewing,
seance phenomena, ghosts,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:10%
and many more.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.715 align:middle line:10%
He poses the idea that
paranormal events are

00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:10%
most often sighted when
society is in disorder,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:10%
and that there's a correlation
between all different aspects

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:10%
of the unknown.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:84%
George Hansen is a number
of the International

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Brotherhood of Magicians.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.445 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:33.231 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Hey, everybody.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to "Mind Shift,"
and I'm delighted to be

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:10%
joined today by George Hansen.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:90%
How you doing, George?

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much for coming by.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just tell us a
little bit about your work,

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
your background,
and how you arrived

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
at writing about tricksters
and paranormality.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:10%
OK, I worked eight years in
parapsychology laboratories,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:10%
three years at the Rhine
Center down in Durham,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:10%
North Carolina, and five
at psychophysical Research

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:10%
Laboratories in Princeton.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize that
there were some rather

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:90%
peculiar aspects to this field.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we did some
pretty good research,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't really getting
much scientific acceptance.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.084 align:middle line:84%
There were pretty
massive campaigns to try

00:24:18.084 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:90%
to discredit the research.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
In the '70s, '80s?

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I worked professionally in the
field eight years in the 1980s.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
So 1981 until 1989.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Also, I was involved in
a number of small groups

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
with psychics and
mediums and the like.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So you were the one who
was setting up experiment

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.569 align:middle line:84%
parameters and stuff like that?
-Oh, yes.

00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did statistical analysis.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I set up methodology, monitored
computer equipment, fixed it.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.645 align:middle line:84%
So on telepathy,
telekinesis, clairvoyance?

00:24:51.645 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, remote viewing,
mind over matter,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
influencing electronics,
random number generators,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
working in what was called the
Ganzfeld Condition, which was

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
partial sensory deprivation
in a telepathy type

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
of experimental
design, as well I

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
was having personal contact
with a lot of psychics

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and other people in
paranormal fields.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So I started realizing that
there were peculiarities.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
One is that, well, these
groups never get very big.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
They never really
institutionalize effectively.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
A laboratory might last
10, maybe 20 years,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:90%
and it falls apart.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Funding dries up.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
There's right now virtually
no universities in the US

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that are doing any kind of
legitimate experimental work.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you do have the
Institute of Noetic Sciences.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
-That's not a university.
-Oh, I know.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:84%
That's a fringe
institution anyway.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:90%
It's basically--

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Just so people know,
the Institute of Noetic

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.481 align:middle line:84%
Sciences was created by the
astronaut Edgar Mitchell,

00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe--
-Yes.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
--To explore psychic
research, psychic phenomena.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.647 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:58.647 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
scientists who work there doing

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
experiments, like
Dean Radin, who

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess is the most prominent.
-Yes.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's still a relatively
small operation.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Radin is probably
the most well known.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Schlitz
is also associated

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:84%
with that institution,
and I work with her.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was a
participant judge

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in her very first published
remote viewing experiment.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.992 align:middle line:84%
Great.
So go ahead.

00:26:20.992 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking about
how there's some odd aspects

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to the whole field.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:90%
One is the marginality.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that this does
not become institutionalized?

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Why is it sneered at?

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is not something new.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started to do some
research to try to understand

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of things I
came across was the fact

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that these phenomena
had been sneered

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:84%
at and put down for literally
2,000 years, if not more.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:90%
This is not something new.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, if one starts to
think about these phenomena,

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:84%
especially if you get
into UFO type phenomena

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
with entity experiences, these
phenomena traditionally have

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:90%
been the realm of religion.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Earlier societies certainly
understood the reality

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
of these phenomena,
and had some very

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
interesting ways of dealing
with them via myth and ritual.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Ritual was used the
control, channel,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and influence
paranormal, supernatural,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:90%
or supernormal forces.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Ritual has been used for
thousands of years to do that.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
There's also myth.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Earlier civilizations
used myth to describe

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and to understand these forces.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing
with is something

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that has been around for a
very, very, very long time.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has always
been in dispute.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
These debates
about the reality--

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Myth is a very fascinating
subject, obviously.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Patrick Harper,
who in some ways,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to you, his
work and your work, I think,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
have interesting
correspondences.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how the myth
is almost like the edge of how

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:90%
we create a world in a way.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The world we're experiencing
is the myth we're in, in a way,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think of
it in those terms.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I contrast myth with more a
scientific, rationalistic,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:90%
empirical approach.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
But there is some overlap.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Harper's work I have
a greater appreciation for,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
but his approach is quite
different than my own.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.299 align:middle line:84%
OK, for sure.
So go ahead.

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:36.261 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
myth and ritual and religion

00:28:36.261 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and so there were
a number of other aspects

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:90%
that fit in here.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture, If
you look at the dollars

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:84%
allocated to the
paranormal, where are they?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, movies like "Independence
Day," or "ET," or "Ghost,"

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and "Ghostbusters" literally
took in hundreds of millions

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
of dollars in box
office receipts--

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, MUFON,
which is largest UFO

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:84%
organization in
this country, had

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:90%
an annual budget of $180,000.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So you've got three orders
of magnitude, 1,000 times

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
budget money going into
fictional portrayal

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and entertainment than
into serious science.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So what were some
of your conclusions

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:90%
from this kind of research?

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot
more to be said.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Really to understand
these phenomena,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
one should look at
analysis of ritual.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's some very
interesting work on ritual done

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:84%
by a man named Arnold van
Gennep, and another one

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:90%
name Victor Turner.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And Turner came up with
the term liminality,

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:90%
a state betwixt and between.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the concept of
liminal and liminality

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is very, very difficult
to convey in 10 minutes,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
or an hour, or even two hours.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I've tried at
numerous conferences.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might have an
audience, both in the studio

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and in the viewing public that
has a deeper understanding

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:90%
than the average audience.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it would take very
long time, even for a relatively

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:90%
educated audience.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's try in a minute.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's not.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to take another approach.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to look at this from
a mythological standpoint

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and from structural
anthropology.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Structural anthropology
is a bit more easily

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.433 align:middle line:90%
explained in a limited time.

00:30:27.433 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:10%
Structural anthropology
and structuralism in general

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:10%
got going in France
in the 1960s,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:10%
a little bit earlier,
primarily through the work

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:10%
of Claude Levy-Strauss, a
very eminent anthropologist.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And in structuralism,
there's a central idea--

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and this got a lot of support--
that earlier civilizations

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and societies divided
things into opposites,

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:90%
binary oppositions.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.017 align:middle line:84%
And let's get the
graph up there.

00:30:59.017 --> 00:31:00.407 align:middle line:84%
OK, George, I got it
right here for you.

00:31:00.407 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have life and death,
god and human, heaven and earth,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:90%
male female, human and beast.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll see
this top line here,

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
generally these elements
have a little bit more power,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more prestige.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They're thought of
a little bit more

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:84%
positively than
these lower elements.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And today, we think, OK, life
is very different than death.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Pretty clear distinction,
not always, but generally.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.970 align:middle line:84%
God and human--
very, very different.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Heaven and earth, yes,
completely different ideas.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Male and female, those
are really clear cut.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Human and beast, those
are very, very distinct.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Nice, clean, very easily
understood concept.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
However, if you start--
and there are many

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
anthropology books that you can
find these kinds of listings

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
However, if you start looking
in this between realm,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:90%
let's turn it over.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We find some very
interesting phenomena

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:90%
between life and death.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what blurs
that distinction?

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, ghosts do.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Mediums tend to
contact the deceased,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:90%
blurring that distinction.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Is a person alive or dead?

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:84%
If they can still communicate,
are they in some sense alive?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Near death experiences, spirits,
that draws into question

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is that distinction
quite so clear?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Mystics between God
and human-- mystics

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:84%
strive to become
one with the divine,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and it is among mystics
that the most powerful

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
paranormal phenomena ever
recorded have occurred,

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
not only in Christianity,
but in other cultures

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and other religions as well.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Between the Heavens and the
Earth, we have UFOs and angels.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Angels are messengers.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:90%
UFOs come from the stars.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Between male and
female, in a number

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:84%
of American Indian
cultures, there were

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:90%
people called the berdache.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
These are people who took
the role of the opposite sex.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:84%
These were looked upon as
having supernatural powers,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and often many of
them became shamans.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Between human and beast?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's
accounts of Bigfoot,

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:90%
werewolves, and vampires.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:84%
All of these now are
called paranormal, or

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.230 align:middle line:90%
supernormal, or supernatural.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.645 align:middle line:90%
This is not new.

00:33:16.645 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But this realm here
is a liminal realm.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's betwixt and between
these binary oppositions.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And it is a realm of taboo.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It is a realm of
ritual observance.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has been looked
upon as a bit dangerous.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.422 align:middle line:84%
George, I'm gonna
put the diagram down.

00:33:35.422 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So that realm has very
different properties.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.335 align:middle line:90%
But let's bring that up again.

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
about the trickster.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.117 align:middle line:90%
No, let's bring that up again.

00:33:46.117 --> 00:33:47.915 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:33:47.915 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
This thing is, we show betwixt
and between these elements

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:90%
of the binary oppositions.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:84%
However, if you start
talking to people

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.440 align:middle line:84%
who have these
experiences, you will

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:84%
find people who have had
ghost experiences might have

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:90%
contact with angels or UFOs.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Many government remote
viewers had UFO experiences.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And Nick Redfern recently
had a post online,

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and he's not the
first, that talked

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
about the number of Bigfoot
sightings in you UFO flaps.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:90%
These merge together.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:90%
These are not separate.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
different kind of realm.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
dealing with, and this

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
is what religion has dealt
with for thousands of years.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is denied,
largely, in our culture today.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And what about psychic
phenomena, like telepathy,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:90%
for instance?

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Are they liminal phenomena also?

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy blurs the distinction
between self and other.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Whose thought am I thinking?

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.679 align:middle line:84%
We usually think of ourselves
as distinct entities.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy seriously
challenges that idea.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.565 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
concept of the trickster

00:34:55.565 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and how that fits
into your mapping.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The trickster is
an abstract concept,

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but virtually all cultures
have had trickster figures.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And in some of them, for
instance, the Navajo,

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:84%
these trickster figures
encode some very,

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
very deep meanings that are
generally not directly grasped.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a folklorist
named Barre Tolken.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Who happened to marry
into the Navajo,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and he had been
studying the trickster

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:84%
for literally decades, I
think two to three decades.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And one night, he was
sitting with a medicine

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.510 align:middle line:90%
man, called a singer.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And the singer
asked him, well, why

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:90%
are you studying the trickster?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you wanna lose a
member of your family?

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And Tolken started looking into
the trickster even more deeply,

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and realized even after
decades of studying it,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:84%
there was a great deal
he had not understood

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:90%
about magical practice.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So he was being warned
there's a danger in that magic,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
resonating, reverberating
negatively back

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.040 align:middle line:90%
on the investigator in a way?

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and other people as
well, people in the vicinity.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So there are reasons
that ritual has

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:84%
been used to hedge off
paranormal or supernatural

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.420 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:90%
This is not new.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by hedge off?

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
To limit the intrusion of
the divine into the world.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:84%
If magic is
occurring frequently,

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.530 align:middle line:90%
it has side effects.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the side effects
is that disruption

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:90%
of personal relationships.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:84%
If you start looking at ghost
groups, or UFO groups that

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:84%
get out and are doing
on-site research,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you will find lots of
interpersonal frictions,

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.950 align:middle line:84%
rivalries, and
eventually schisms,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of recriminations.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been an adviser to
a number of ghost groups,

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and there is a term now
called paradrama that

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:90%
applies to ghost researchers.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:90%
These groups do not last.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They do not effectively
institutionalize.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.284 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
groups around the world.

00:36:56.284 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's a good thing
if they were to effectively

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:90%
institutionalize?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just observing
it as a phenomenon

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
without a negative or
positive charge to it?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think there
have certainly been

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
attempts to institutionalize.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:90%
They have failed.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
very important data.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:11.985 align:middle line:90%
It helps us understand.

00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in Victor
Turner's work on liminality,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:84%
he uses the term
anti-structure, things that

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
tend to blur, to
fall apart, become

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
ambiguous, that do not maintain
long term, stable relations.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
in this liminal realm

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is this effect of
anti-structure.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:84%
These groups who deal with these
phenomena tend to break up.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
pertinent to just this culture.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Other cultures as well
have understood this.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's
a group in East

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Timor who have talked about it.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.300 align:middle line:84%
If a person sees a ghost
outside a ritual context,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:90%
that's a rather dangerous thing.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And if this happens frequently,
tensions between kin intensify.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So the contact with this
sacred, this liminal realm,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
does have dangers, and has
implications for our society.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:90%
So here's my question for you.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
One of my hypotheses-- I
know you read my 2012 book--

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow as humanity
is evolving in consciousness,

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.140 align:middle line:84%
we could make a shift where
we could actually integrate

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.530 align:middle line:84%
these areas that
have been suppressed,

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.070 align:middle line:90%
the psychic and the paranormal.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
a likely phenomenon?

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I think quite the contrary.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
As our societies
become more complex,

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and the greater
division of labor,

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.615 align:middle line:84%
we see a greater suppression
and demeaning of the paranormal

00:38:40.615 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:90%
and the supernatural.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:84%
On one level, but then we
also see all these films,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.915 align:middle line:84%
like "Harry Potter," "The
Matrix," "Avatar," which

00:38:46.915 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
are over and over again not only
suggesting that this is very

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.970 align:middle line:84%
crucial, or "Star
Wars," but there

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
needs to be some kind of
training program, or school,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
or institution, whether it's
Hogwarts, or the initiation.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Au contraire.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I completely disagree with this.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
No, the fiction, there
are thousands of times

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:84%
more dollars spent on fiction,
as I alluded to previously.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:84%
What fiction does
is, this writes

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:90%
the phenomena into fiction.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:84%
People do not have
to take it seriously.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%
They can play with it.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They can look at it, but they
don't really deal with it.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And this happens over,
and over, and over again.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The fiction is a very
important part of this,

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:84%
but the fiction has a
very particular function.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is to keep people
thinking it is fiction,

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and not take it seriously.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You can see the same
thing with the suppression

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
in both religion, and
with skeptics groups.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church's
catechism specifically

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
declares practice
of clairvoyance

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be forbidden.
The skeptics group--

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.154 align:middle line:90%
What about omniscience?

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The skeptics group, Committee
for Skeptical Inquiry,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.060 align:middle line:90%
ridicules such attempts.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So they both
effectively suppress

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
or deny the reality
of this, and it

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:90%
has the same effect on society.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So fiction has a very
important role to play,

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.530 align:middle line:84%
but the role is not to
stimulate the phenomena,

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:90%
but to suppress it.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:84%
To get people to think
about just a little bit.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, haha, this is fun,
fun to think about.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
take it seriously.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think
that's ever gonna change?

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.295 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it will change
with the current structure

00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:90%
of society.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
If society becomes
less hierarchical,

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and there are more
competing groups

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than a centralized
control, that might happen.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We see much more active
use of these phenomena

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in hunter-gatherer
societies than we

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:84%
do in agricultural and
industrial societies even less.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So social structure and our
relationship to the mysterious,

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the divine, the
paranormal, the trickster

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:90%
are so inherently related.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:84%
-Absolutely.
-Cool.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're about to bring
you on with Richard Dolan.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And just before we do,
though, I'm just curious.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you see what he maps out as
potentially secret government

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to connection to
extraterrestrials

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and some types of hyper
futuristic technologies

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:90%
that have developed in secret?

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that as a
liminal phenomenon,

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or something that would
be at maybe a literal,

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:90%
real parallel phenomenon?

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I see it as
mythological phenomenon.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.920 align:middle line:10%
I think Roswell and
UFO area in general

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:10%
is heavily imbued with myth.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the myth takes
on a life of its own.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And people live myths, and
myths live through people.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I believe what
we're seeing here

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
is this myth taking
a form of its own

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.640 align:middle line:84%
through the social structure
in the intelligence community

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.049 align:middle line:84%
and farther.
-Awesome.

00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:40.949 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's bring on Richard
and have a little discussion

00:41:40.949 --> 00:41:41.648 align:middle line:90%
around this.

00:41:41.648 --> 00:41:43.215 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, and
we'll back right back.

I'm so happy you
guys could join me.

No, just kidding!

We're here for "Mind Shift."

We're discussing the paranormal

So let's just jump into it.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.980 align:middle line:10%
George, you had some
interesting ideas

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.570 align:middle line:10%
around the mythological nature
of the alien phenomenon.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.315 align:middle line:84%
And I'm curious for you
just to give us a sense,

00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:42.690 align:middle line:84%
do you think it's
literally happening?

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
mythological happening?

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Are those things ultimately
merging in some liminal dream

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.011 align:middle line:90%
space that is our reality?

00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
definitely merging.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
a lot of reality.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
that the government

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.960 align:middle line:84%
has provided a lot
of disinformation,

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:84%
covered up UFO
cases and phenomena,

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.145 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't really
wanna talk about it.

00:43:00.145 --> 00:43:01.880 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.450 align:middle line:90%
That's part of a myth.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:84%
That feeds into the
myth, and people

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.306 align:middle line:90%
start accepting some of it.

00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Other people start
challenging it.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But all of this
focuses attention

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.660 align:middle line:90%
on this whole idea of ET.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
The myth is living in some
sense, through people.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:10%
But whether the government
really has crashed saucers

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:10%
and are doing
reverse engineering,

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.800 align:middle line:10%
I seriously doubt that.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's interesting.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And Richard, how
would you reply?

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say
that you had everything

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:84%
great right up until
you started talking

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
about UFOs as purely myth.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.347 align:middle line:10%
I think you're really
misinformed on the topic,

00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:38.780 align:middle line:10%
or maybe just haven't
done enough research.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I think there's, first of
all, A, a tremendous amount

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of evidence through
documentation to start,

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's a definite reality
of somebody's technology

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that is not accounted
for in this civilization.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:00.577 align:middle line:84%
Now, that could leave us with a
couple different possibilities.

00:44:00.577 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this weekend,
I spoke to a friend

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
who's an aerospace engineer
who works for the government.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that he's been
documenting crafts that seem

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.205 align:middle line:84%
to have propulsion systems
that we have no explanation

00:44:11.205 --> 00:44:12.305 align:middle line:84%
for, no coherent
explanation for.

00:44:12.305 --> 00:44:15.680 align:middle line:90%
This happens frequently indeed.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I am not suggesting that
these phenomena are imaginary.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there is a physical
reality here, that there

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:90%
are lights in the sky.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of these phenomena tend
to materialize, but then--

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Are you using myth
in a different way

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.340 align:middle line:84%
than maybe a colloquial way?
-Yes, yes.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:84%
-I thought so.
-Yes.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
say it's a myth,

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and what does that
actually mean?

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:84%
A myth is a pattern
that keeps repeating.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And people live through it.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It works like an archetype.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The certain collective
consciousness

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:84%
has some idea that there is
something from outer space,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.650 align:middle line:90%
or from afar.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.247 align:middle line:84%
And it manifests somehow,
whether it's in our fiction.

00:45:00.247 --> 00:45:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I just wanna say that
your description of a myth

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:84%
as a pattern that
keeps repeating

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is identical to Rupert
Sheldrake's ideas

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.084 align:middle line:84%
around the laws of
nature themselves,

00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that the idea that
they're actually fixed

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and immutable laws is only a
construct of a certain type

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:84%
scientific mentality, that they
might be more like habit habits

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or patterns that
recur repeatedly

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and verifiably over time to
the point where they seem

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:90%
like permanent immutable laws.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.184 align:middle line:84%
I would be very
sympathetic to that, yes.

00:45:25.184 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, so great go ahead.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not challenging
Richard Dolan's idea

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that there are physical
entities out there of some type.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I do seriously question
whether they are nuts and bolts

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:84%
craft, advanced technology
from some other civilization.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:90%
What else would they be?

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.780 align:middle line:84%
They are something
we don't understand.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:90%
They might be alive.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They might be some
projection from ourselves.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't really spend
much time on that.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of this story of
this guy, an anthropologist who

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.220 align:middle line:84%
was hanging out with
Australian Aboriginals,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying to
get them to explain

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.160 align:middle line:84%
their concept of the dream
time and the dreaming.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And the aboriginal
pointed to a jet plane

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.620 align:middle line:90%
that was going across the sky.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.635 align:middle line:90%
And he said, white man dreaming.

00:46:07.635 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:90%
[GIGGLING]

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, something alive, sure?

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're hitting
up against a reality that

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is at the limits of
what we are sometimes

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:90%
really able fully to grasp.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But I would say there's a
danger that I sometimes hear,

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.470 align:middle line:84%
where people are inferring
that this phenomenon is almost

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:32.280 align:middle line:84%
purely a reflection
of our own thoughts.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a real mistake.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.300 align:middle line:84%
What if it's a co-creation
of our own thoughts?

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.915 align:middle line:90%
Co-creation with what?

00:46:39.915 --> 00:46:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind
of fuzzy to me.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that is causing people

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to react, to see,
and experience,

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and measure, measure
phenomenon that's there.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously,
our minds perceive

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
a certain portion of the whole
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Our minds perceive a certain
portion of the reality

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.430 align:middle line:90%
that's around us.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.640 align:middle line:90%
So we're selecting, clearly.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
that is affecting us,

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and the question
is what is that?

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a real
mistake, and this even

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
goes to someone like
Jung, if in fact, he

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.260 align:middle line:84%
did assume that this is purely
a reflection of our unconscious,

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.340 align:middle line:90%
or somehow us.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.340 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a mistake.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.151 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole
question of what it is--

00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not even that it's a
reflection of our unconscious.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It's more that there
are these processes.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, the archetypes or
the collective unconscious

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:84%
has a reality that's almost
greater than ours in a sense.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We're more like
emanations of it,

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and then these
processes are happening

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.780 align:middle line:84%
through the collective
psyche, in a sense.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that even
the question of what is it

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:84%
really makes any sense
or is really useful.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we should look
at its properties.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.970 align:middle line:90%
When does it occur?

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:90%
What side effects does it have?

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of people interact
with these phenomena?

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.470 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of
people report them?

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going to give us
a lot more insight than trying

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to speculate as to what it is.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.851 align:middle line:84%
We need to find out the
properties, the characteristics

00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of these phenomena.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you have to
literally more than 10,000

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:84%
reports filed in North America
alone every single year,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
people who report it

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.430 align:middle line:84%
are, basically,
everybody, every age, and

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.967 align:middle line:90%
every sociological breakdown.

00:48:17.967 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Just a question, though.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.490 align:middle line:84%
If we were to do what
you said, and approach it

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in that sort of
phenomenological manner,

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and let's say we
began to determine

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.830 align:middle line:84%
what the phenomenon was, then
what would be the next step?

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
know what it is

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.200 align:middle line:90%
before we know the next step.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.450 align:middle line:10%
For instance, if you have strong
contact with these phenomena,

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:41.590 align:middle line:10%
one's life tends to become
a little bit unsettled.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
significant aspect of this.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The groups that try to study
these phenomena don't last.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have somebody
like Steven Greer,

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.574 align:middle line:84%
and I have a number of friends
have now gone on missions

00:48:55.574 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:84%
with him, where he
claims that he's

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:84%
able to reliably bring
these craft into some kind

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.300 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, you
could say that he's

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:84%
creating his own ritual, and
he's then having an effect.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
somewhat cult-like.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Greer's work is not scientific.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It is much more
religious and cult-like?

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:90%
What isn't a cult, though?

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Is capitalism not a cult?

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Greer is a charismatic leader.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism does not rely
upon charismatic leaders,

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:90%
by and large.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So the religious definition,
or sociological definition,

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of a cult, I think Greer
would come very close to that.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
He is clearly a
charismatic figure,

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and has drawn many
people to him.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
He does not seem to be terribly
scientifically interesting.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:39.945 align:middle line:84%
But there are people I know
who are not believers in Greer,

00:49:39.945 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or part of his
cult. And they go,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and they've had these verifiably
reliable experiences craft

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.180 align:middle line:90%
or lights appearing and so on.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't deny that all.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:50.620 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I would suspect that.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I've known a number of people
in other religious groups

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:84%
who had similar types
of UFO encounters.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So I am not discounting
the phenomena themselves.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.160 align:middle line:84%
One idea that a
number of researchers

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.030 align:middle line:84%
have become fascinated with is
the prospect that there could

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.660 align:middle line:84%
be another type of
energy technology

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that, if this phenomenon
is real in some sense,

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
they're not getting
here on coal or nuclear,

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.165 align:middle line:84%
so the idea that there's some
type of a zero point field,

00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:84%
or free energy, or the
ability to draw on the quantum

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.950 align:middle line:90%
fluctuations of the vacuum.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And then an idea that
develops from that

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is that that
technology would almost

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:32.090 align:middle line:84%
be one that would require
consciousness mediation.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it could very
well be the case, Daniel.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.950 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, look, a child who
would see a flying saucer,

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.220 align:middle line:10%
let's just say, that
zips around the sky.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously not
using petroleum.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's using
something different.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And something like the zero
point energy field, I think,

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:51.200 align:middle line:90%
is a reasonable possibility.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Even Tesla, I think, was really
working along those lines,

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:90%
it seems to me.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So there's a solution there.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.267 align:middle line:84%
Now, the consciousness
connection, I think,

00:51:00.267 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
is a very intriguing one.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.702 align:middle line:84%
And certainly what you have in,
let's call it the research--

00:51:06.702 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
if we can call the
research, among claims--

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is a
key part in the operation

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.800 align:middle line:90%
of some of these craft.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.140 align:middle line:90%
One hears this claim frequently.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a reasonable
thing to wonder about.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we're
seeing our technologies,

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.780 align:middle line:84%
communications technologies,
seeming to be moving almost

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:84%
towards that, in
a sense becoming

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:84%
more and more subtle,
more and more consciously

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.990 align:middle line:90%
directed somehow.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I think what we may
be looking toward is

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.090 align:middle line:84%
a kind of cybernetic
future, and maybe that's

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:90%
what these other beings are.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a combination of
advanced biological, artificial

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:84%
biological, life forms,
biological nonetheless

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.744 align:middle line:90%
with technological enhancements.

00:51:51.744 --> 00:51:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then you could

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.411 align:middle line:84%
easily interface with your
web, or with your craft,

00:51:56.411 --> 00:51:57.110 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, but these
types of phenomena,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.550 align:middle line:84%
you're describing normal
physics, essentially,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.240 align:middle line:84%
or slightly expanded,
would not account

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.450 align:middle line:90%
for things like precognition.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And precognition
is a very widely

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:06.610 align:middle line:90%
reported paranormal phenomenon.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It involves
consciousness, and it

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.860 align:middle line:84%
has been reported for
thousands of years,

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and has been generally
regarded as myth,

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:84%
as untrue among normal
physical scientists.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So also the technology
explanation does not explain--

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:84%
How would you account
for precogntion, then?

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have my way
of accounting for it.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't try to account for it.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I look at the effects of it.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.320 align:middle line:90%
What kinds of people have it?

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.530 align:middle line:84%
What happens when precognitive
experiences happen?

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.430 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of
events surround it?

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't try to build
a theoretical model based

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.950 align:middle line:90%
on something without data.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Also, the technological
explanation of UFOs

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.930 align:middle line:84%
does not explain the
breakup of UFO groups,

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and the little
institutionalization

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and the very pretty
heavy prevalence of fraud

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and deception in
the government, as

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.260 align:middle line:90%
well as hoaxers and the like.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you discuss that
in your trickster book,

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how there's a
level of deception and trickery

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
psychic phenomena

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.570 align:middle line:84%
as part of this liminal
realm, in a sense.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Cool, we only have
a few minutes left,

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and we could so easily
have, like, a five hour

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.780 align:middle line:84%
dialogue that I think would also
be really, really interesting.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.479 align:middle line:90%
Easily.

00:53:18.479 --> 00:53:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy that both
of you joined me today.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask you a last question.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:84%
30 years from now, 20 to 50
years from now, let's say,

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.990 align:middle line:84%
are we gonna know anything
extremely, extravagantly

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.220 align:middle line:90%
different than we know now?

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Are we gonna be in a
more psychic dimension?

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Are we gonna be playing ping
pong with extraterrestrials?

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.510 align:middle line:90%
What's gonna be going on?

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:90%
What your perspectives?

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was a
friend of Phil Klass.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And Phil Klass has
his famous curse.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You will know no more
on your death bed

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:49.940 align:middle line:90%
than you do know about UFOs.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that's
largely the case.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.300 align:middle line:10%
I think the progress
in these fields

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.910 align:middle line:10%
is gonna be very, very slow.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I would agree that
throughout the last 20, 30, 40

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:84%
years of this,
researchers have thought,

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, now is the time where
we're gonna break through.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.760 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna get the secret.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It'll all come down.

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.340 align:middle line:10%
You know, this isn't the first
time in our modern history

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.990 align:middle line:10%
where researchers thought, OK,
we're gonna get disclosure.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.250 align:middle line:90%
They thought this 20 years ago.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.030 align:middle line:84%
They thought this
30, 40, 50 years ago.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:20.050 align:middle line:84%
However-- however,
this is different.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We're in a fundamentally
different era now.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.614 align:middle line:90%
And I see us in the next--

00:54:24.614 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they probably said
that 20, 30 years ago, also.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but this is
really different.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.194 align:middle line:90%
This is really, truly different.

00:54:30.194 --> 00:54:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've had
the last 20 years

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.660 align:middle line:84%
of the web, which
have completely

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.780 align:middle line:90%
transformed this world.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We are able to communicate
with each other in ways

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that we could not have
dreamed of 20 years.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're able to
broadcast this to an audience,

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.890 align:middle line:90%
which before the web, wasn't--

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Are we caught in the web, or
are we able to step around it?

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.760 align:middle line:90%
No, we're using the web.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.665 align:middle line:84%
And the web is a good
thing in this regard.

00:54:47.665 --> 00:54:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's transformed us.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But that's only one aspect of
this greater transformation.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I think in 20 years
from now, we're

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.487 align:middle line:84%
gonna be living in a society
that-- I don't think any of us

00:54:57.487 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
can really predict exactly
how it will be different,

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but I think it will be
dramatically different.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And that means politically.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:90%
That means financially.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.530 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of revolutions,

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.985 align:middle line:84%
I think, we're right
on the cusp of.

00:55:09.985 --> 00:55:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And that means scientifically
in a lot of key ways.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're
gonna have a very

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.084 align:middle line:84%
different kind of basis
of what we consider

00:55:18.084 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:90%
our fundamental knowledge.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I believe-- I don't
know, but I believe

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that one of those
things will be a more

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.700 align:middle line:84%
open recognition of, let's
call it, the UFO phenomenon.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.380 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
we'll have the answers.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, George,
he's, I would say,

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:84%
reflecting what you said before,
that if our social structure

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:40.050 align:middle line:84%
changes sufficiently, then new
possibilities emerge, and even

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.430 align:middle line:84%
a new mythology
allows for a new,

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.450 align:middle line:84%
quote unquote, literal
or real phenomena

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:45.800 align:middle line:90%
then, to take place within it.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Last thing I'll just
say, we're on a cusp.

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:90%
We're at a crossroads.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're either gonna move into
a situation of a really awful

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.050 align:middle line:84%
global fascism,
global, or something

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:84%
better than that,
something in which

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a more horizontal,
less hierarchical

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:90%
kind of a structure.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Or are you still thinking
in binary oppositions?

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, I don't know what
you really mean in that sense.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
moving either--

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a battle that's
taking place right now.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And it is a battle between--

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Could we both have a total
authoritarian, totalitarian

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.490 align:middle line:84%
situation that's also
incredibly awesome,

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:22.340 align:middle line:84%
where everybody has evolved to
a higher level of psychic being?

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.910 align:middle line:84%
We would have an awesome
totalitarian system

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:26.174 align:middle line:84%
if everyone's vegged out in
their own little private Idaho

00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:28.140 align:middle line:84%
with their own little fantasies,
and their own little three

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.910 align:middle line:84%
dimensional holographic
realities, which would

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:31.380 align:middle line:90%
be not really my paradise.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.240 align:middle line:90%
But I think that's--

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.030 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, this might
already be a three dimensional

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.229 align:middle line:84%
holographic reality,
and we're being

00:56:35.229 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:84%
projecting into
it from some type

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:90%
of a technological interface.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a
theory, actually,

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.260 align:middle line:90%
from one mathematician.

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I read his work, and
that's actually his belief.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, right?

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.961 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll never know that.

00:56:45.961 --> 00:56:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that
we're at a crossroads,

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and things could get
really, really dark,

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.020 align:middle line:84%
or they could go
in a different way.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And if they're gonna
go in a better way,

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.760 align:middle line:84%
it's gonna take not just
simply consciousness, per se,

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.180 align:middle line:90%
but political consciousness.

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.645 align:middle line:84%
People are gonna really have to
organize and make some changes

00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:03.590 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of power.
-OK, awesome.

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:04.590 align:middle line:90%
So we're gonna rise up.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:05.510 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna do it.

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with me here today.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.056 align:middle line:90%
It was an awesome discussion.

00:57:08.056 --> 00:57:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to many more over
the course of however much time

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.680 align:middle line:90%
we have or whatever time is.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.430 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:21.500 align:middle line:90%
