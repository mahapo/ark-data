00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Hey, everybody.
Welcome to "Mind Shift."

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.420 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we are
discussing that power of women

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:10%
to change the world with
the extraordinary performer,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:10%
writer and activist Eve Ensler,
and the incredibly precocious

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:10%
Islamic feminist Jerin Arifa.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Eve recently won
a harrowing battle

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
against cancer, described
in her latest book,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:90%
"In the Body of the World."

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, she has
helped women in the Congo

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to overcome a situation
of tremendous oppression,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and build a new
school, City of Hope.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.505 align:middle line:84%
She's extraordinarily inspiring,
and it's a great pleasure

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:34.926 align:middle line:90%
to speak with her.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
There is something precious,
and something worth living,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and living for, and we are
here today to share that,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and to figure that out, and to
find out what it means to use

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
the time that we
have in the body

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have to the
best of our abilities

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.166 align:middle line:90%
to understand each other.

-Hi.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.551 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining us on "Mind Shift."

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
-Thrilled to be here.
-I really appreciate it.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, maybe just
tell us a little

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
about your recent
trajectory, your new book,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.661 align:middle line:84%
and the work you're doing
with One Billion Rising.

00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm really
happy to be here.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I think this show's awesome,
and it's a really great idea.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, "In the Body of
the World" is a memoir,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:10%
and it's kind of
based on a combination

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:10%
of factors and inspirations.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:90%
One was cancer.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I had stage three/four
uterine cancer.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And that compelled
me or propelled me

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
into a whole new
trajectory, both in my body,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and coming into my body.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.461 align:middle line:84%
Because I went through a huge
kind of apocalypse in my body.

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, I--

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.626 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounded
like that from the book.

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
it sounded very extreme.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very extreme.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And through the process of
all that happening, what

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
began to happen
is I begin to have

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
this very transformative
experience that's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%
kind of taken me by surprise.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And it really began
with the diagnosis,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and shot me into this
state of-- I was on my way

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
to Haiti to do work
in Haiti, and I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
suddenly heard, you
have stage four cancer,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
stage three cancer.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And three days, I was
in nine hour surgery,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
organs were removed.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think what was amazing
about the whole experience is

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that for so much of my life,
I had been searching for a way

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
back into my body.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I think, for many of us who
have been traumatized when we're

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
younger, or were abused,
or sexually attacked,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.487 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- I think all
of us are traumatized.

00:04:01.487 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anyone
on the planet who's not

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
traumatized, but I think some
people have secondary trauma,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and some people
have primary trauma.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had survived both
rape and enormous violence

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:90%
from my own father.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
And I think at a very
young age, I left my body.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It was just too
terrible place, and too

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%
terrifying a place to inhabit.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
I left or lost connection

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth, with just
the basis of existence,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and was floating
for a long time.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happened
when I was diagnosed

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and went through this
surgery is I landed.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I woke up, and I was in my body.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I had tubes coming
out of every port.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:90%
I had ports.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I had catheters.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I had machines.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time I was ever in here.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And that began this incredible--
which I can only describe

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
as a mystical experience
of beginning to land more,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and more, and more inside my
body, which was landing me more

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and more inside the Earth,
and more and more connected

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:90%
to everything around me.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I got to chemo,
which was down the journey

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
after infections
and operations, I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
was really terrified of
chemo, the idea of putting

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:90%
poison into my bloodstream.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It just felt claustrophobic.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It felt end of the world.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had this brilliant
therapist who's

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
really a visionary person.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And she just showed up one day.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I notice one chapter you talked
about imagining all the reasons

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
why you might have
gotten this cancer, as

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
if there was some reason
for this to have happened.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was that something
that you have to go through,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
sort of feeling like a victim
or some kind of process

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
had been inflicted
on you in some way?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think when you're
diagnosed with cancer,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
you just think, well,
why do I have this?

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.187 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and obviously a lot's
to do with the environment,

00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and what we've done to the
environment, and the conditions

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of poisoning that we've done.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
also so many factors.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Was it Tab that I drank?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Was it cigarettes?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Was it having a violent father?

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think you just try
to process every possibility.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I came to is it's

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
probably all those things and
none of those things, you know?

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that happened in chemo

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
was that this therapist came,
and she basically gave me

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:84%
a frame for the whole
experience, which was she said

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to me, I want you to imagine
that when the poison's entering

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
your body that it's
gonna burn away

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:90%
everything that needs to go.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're just gonna
burn away your past,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're gonna
burn away any sense

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:90%
of victimhood you've ever had.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're gonna
burn away the rapist.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Because for many,
many years of my life,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been listening to
the stories of women

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
around the planet through V-Day,
the global movement, who've

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
been raped, and
who've been abused.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
holding a lot of stories

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
in my body, which kind of
made a tumor eventually.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.847 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about there's
this guy called Gabor Mate.

00:06:45.847 --> 00:06:47.379 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard about him?
-No.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
He's a psychiatrist
in Vancouver.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
He spoke at this conference
I was at about healing.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And he basically, he's done
a lot of work with Ayahuasca

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
also, and ends up with the
theory that a lot of what

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
happens to us
physically is based

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
on things like
story, and narrative,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.831 align:middle line:84%
or emotions that get
stored in the body.

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.375 align:middle line:84%
So he talking--
-Oh, he has a book on trauma.

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:09.074 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I did meet him at Democracy
Now a few months ago, yes.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So he talked about,
for instance,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
how he thinks that
breast cancer is

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
often caused from repressed
anger that women feel.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
no doubt about it,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
a direct connection
between trauma and disease,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and particularly reproductive
cancers and sexual abuse.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think years from now,
we'll call cancer trauma.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll be treating it in
very, very similar ways.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Because my whole experience
was the more I dealt

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
with my trauma, and the
more I processed it,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and the more I released
it, the better I got.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not to say
it's the cure for cancer,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
but I know that there
is a direct correlation

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
between me getting sick and
me having unprocessed trauma.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my life now
traveling and spending

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
years with women
who've been abused,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and women particularly
on the front lines,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
for example, who hear
stories about rape.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I know four
women who got cancer, who

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:90%
are doing that kind of work.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think where does
all that go in our bodies?

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:90%
It goes into our cells.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It becomes something else.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And without a way
of talking about it,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and processing it, and releasing
it, it becomes a disease.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And particularly in the book,
you talked about the experience

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
in the Congo.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you share a little bit?

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure everybody's
aware of what's happened

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Congo, and
also how it relates

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to the West's infatuation with
technology and so on, also.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, seven years
ago, I was invited

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to the Democratic
Republic of Congo

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
by an extraordinary man
named Dr. Denis Mukwege, who

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
is one of the noblest,
grandest people on the planet,

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and he's a surgeon and
a doctor at the Panzi

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Hospital in Bukavu, DRC.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's been doing some amazing
work, very, very painful work

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
on sewing up women in their
vaginas and their parts

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
in the DRC, who are
being massively raped

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in a conflict that
has been raging

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
for the last eight years--
I'm sorry, the last 13 years.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we're talking about 8
million people who have died.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that hundreds
and thousands of women

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
have been raped, but I think
in the end it will be millions.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I went there, I
had been traveling the world

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
for many years supporting
women who are survivors,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:84%
but I'd never seen anything
like what was going on there.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And the war in Congo is
propelled by natural resources,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
coltan, which goes
into our cellphones

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and PlayStations, copper, tin.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It is a place that has
been plummeted by the world

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and plundered for years under
King Leopold, originally,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.027 align:middle line:90%
and his colonialist regime.

00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Originally, we created
even the borders

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.365 align:middle line:84%
of these different countries
to allow for the extraction

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:43.131 align:middle line:90%
of resources and so on.

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And now the way it works
is that militias are hired

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
by proxy groups, and
corporate groups,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and governments that
go into villages.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of their primary
methods now is mass rape.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it's cheap, and it's
immediate, and it's effective.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you rape the
women in a family,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
or have the husbands
rape their daughters,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or the brothers
rape their sisters,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
you destroy the
family structure.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
The family's forced to flee.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The villagers flee,and
you take over the mines.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a horrific,
horrific tactic.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And thousands and thousands
of women have been raped,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking
about brutally raped.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Raped in ways that, when
I first went to the Congo,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to be honest with
you, I was shattered.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I stopped sleeping for years.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm just beginning to sleep now.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But my story became
very interwoven

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
with the women of Congo,
because when I went there,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I made a commitment that V-Day,
movement, would be with them

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:90%
until the violence stops.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the process
of building this place called

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the City of Joy, which I'm very
happy to say is running now

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:90%
and open.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But it was a place
for women survivors.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a revolutionary center.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a laboratory of love.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It's really a completely new
concept, where 90 women come

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
for six months,
and they are healed

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
through therapeutic love,
through dance, through theater,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
through all kinds of
healing, through massage,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:90%
through talk, through touch.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they are trained,
and built, and educated

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to become leaders, who then
return to their communities

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and pass on and lift
up their communities.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that sounds so
incredibly important,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
but then I wonder also if more
like the social and structural

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the situation
aren't changed,

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
how will that violence not
keep being perpetuated?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to that question is,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
until the structural
changes happen, it won't.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But how are we gonna
change the structure?

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we waited for years for
the international community,

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and the governments, and
the leaders of the world

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to stop supporting, for
example, this country, US,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to stop supporting
Rwanda, which is

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.921 align:middle line:84%
very much responsible for a lot
of the M23s and the militias

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not happening because
the interests are too great.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:10%
I, myself, believe in building
grassroots revolutions,

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:10%
and grassroots
forces and energies

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:10%
that can begin to
build, and amass

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:10%
power, and take things over.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we keep
going, in five years,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
we'll have 1,000 women who
are trained and revolutionary,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
who will begin to have impact
on that country and the world.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:90%
I've tried every tactic.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.704 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, I've
been at the UN.

00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been at the governments.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.644 align:middle line:90%
I've been at Downing Street.

00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:90%
I've been at the White House.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But where there feels like
there's a yes energetically

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is supporting women who can
drive the future of the Congo.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
incredible results now

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
in women who are
graduating and going back

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to their communities, and really
overhauling the whole culture,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
questioning values, questioning
tradition, demanding rights,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
standing up, and
started cooperatives,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
where they're
feeding their sisters

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and building communities.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of faith in women.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of faith in women.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
You basically just began as an
artist, a performance artist,

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and so on, a playwright.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you anticipate moving
into social movement

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.985 align:middle line:84%
organizing or social
movement building in a way?

00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think I've always
been a political activist,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and an artist.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was always a
hard life to live weave

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:90%
together when I was younger.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, as a writer,
you don't wanna be didactic,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and you wanna allow
your characters

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and have
a point of view

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that's not yours, but theirs.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I think with "The
Vagina Monologues"

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:84%
it was the first
time where I realized

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:90%
the worlds could come together.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I could write a play that
was funny, and disturbing,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and outrageous,
and what happened

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
was, after I started
performing it,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
women would line up after
the show every night.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, great.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They're gonna tell me
about their orgasms,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and what wonderful
sex lives they have,

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and this is gonna be amazing.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, women
lined up to tell me

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
how they'd been beaten,
and raped, and gang-raped,

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:90%
and abused, and incested.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I almost had a break down,
because I felt like I was being

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
privy to secrets that they
had never told anyone,

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know
what to do with them.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was shortly after
that I called a group of women

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
together in my living
room, because I think

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
all things begin in
small rooms like this,

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
where you start the
vision of a new world.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I have this play.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
How could we use it
to stop violence?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And we came up with
V-Day, which was

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Vagina Day, Valentine's Day.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And we did one performance
of "The Vagina Monologues"

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
in New York with all
these amazing performers,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
from Whoopie Goldberg
to Lily Tomlin

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to Susan Sarandon
and Glenn Close.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the
theater blew off.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
The roof of the
theater blew off.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And that was 16 years ago.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And that has just
spread like wildfire.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And now V-Day, it's
16 years later.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We've raised $100 million.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
That has all gone to local
grassroots groups that work

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:90%
to stop violence against women.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And last year, we were able to
birth One Billion Rising, which

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest-- I
think, it probably

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest
mass global action

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that's ever happened on
the planet, where a billion

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
people rose, and danced, and
did outrageous creative acts

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
on February 14th last year.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And One Billion
Rising was particularly

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
an uprising or public outcry
against sexual violence.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think what was really
thrilling about it, because it

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
happened in 207
countries, is there

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:90%
was enormous intersectionality.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We saw in the Philippines,
for example, the people who

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
were protesting, who
were anti-imperialist

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and against militarization
of bases, which

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
is causing sexual
violence, join forces

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
with the anti-violence people.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
We saw all over the
world, economic inequality

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and injustice being joined with
anti-violence against women.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think, same with
anti-environmental actions,

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:84%
groups that are working to stop
environmental injustice are

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
now joining forces with violence
against women activists.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to me, that's
the most exciting thing,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're actually building
a much broader-based movement,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
understanding that all these
things are interconnected.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can't stop
violence against women

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
without looking at
poverty, or racism,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
or environmental injustice,
or economic injustice.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:90%
They're all connected.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I know you have another event
coming up in February 2014.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
If anybody in our audience
wants to get involved with it,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:90%
what's required of them?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:90%
What do they have to do?

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just
have to decide you

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:90%
want to rise on February 14th.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It's One Billion
Rising for Justice.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the feeling
of a lot of our coordinators

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
around the world that
justice is a major theme,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to me that
justice, to some degree,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
makes more sense talking
about than democracy,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.835 align:middle line:84%
because the word democracy
has been so polluted

00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
in so many ways, and corrupted.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think we all can
get behind justice.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And for many women across the
planet, who have been either

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
in wars like World War II, where
the comfort women, for example,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
all throughout Asia were
taken by the Japanese

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and held as sex slaves for
months, and months, and months,

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
they've been waiting for
50 years for justice,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
for just the Japanese
government to say we're sorry,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
make reparations.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:90%
You know, I've been in Bosnia.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I have been in Kosovo.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I have been in every
country in the world,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
where people are
waiting for justice,

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:90%
women are waiting for justice.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think until we begin
to look at a justice that

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
is a transformative justice, a
justice that doesn't just build

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
more prisons, and
incarcerate more people,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and lock up the
poor, but a justice

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that is really looking at root
causes-- why are so many men

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
raping women?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
Why are so many men
creating violence?

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what is
that reason then?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does the
culture of masculinity

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
have to be reformed,
or what needs

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%
to take place in your opinion?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think everything about
the culture of masculinity

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:90%
has to be reformed.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think the
basis of masculinity

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
has to do with overpowering,
and domination, and occupation.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's the patriarchy.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It's based on the father, right?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It's based on principles where
men need to be in charge,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and men need to
dominate, and men

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
insert their will on others.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of moving
things I saw with One Billion

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Rising is how many men were
part of that global action,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and how many men are asserting
a different kind of masculinity

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that isn't about terrorizing
and isn't about domination,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
but is about tenderness, and
it's about vulnerability,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and it's about connection.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
tyranny of patriarchy

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
has impacted men in some ways
far worse than it has women.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's made men divorce
themselves from their heart,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and divorce themselves
from their tears,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and divorce themselves from
questioning, and mystery,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing,
and forcing them

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to know answers to questions
or pretend they do to answers

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:90%
they don't have.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I think a big
part of the movement

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
now it is the
engagement of men, and

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.077 align:middle line:90%
working with men as our allies.

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
We were talking before,
before we began the interview,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.914 align:middle line:84%
around the work of
Terrence McKenna,

00:18:41.914 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and I was kind of surprised,
because it seemed so different

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:84%
than your normal
concerns, but you

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.599 align:middle line:84%
were saying that you've
been finding a lot

00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:90%
of inspiration in his ideas.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Terrence was a
psychedelic philosopher

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
who talked about mushrooms, the
origin of human consciousness,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of a
kind of eschaton

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
or a kind of redemptive
transformation

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:90%
of human society.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious how
that interests you,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and maybe how that becomes
part of this new paradigm

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or new masculine
construct in a way.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think- I'm
actually obsessed right

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.511 align:middle line:84%
now with Terrence McKenna.
-It's his voice.

00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:90%
His voice is just--

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
He's just incredible,
and I think there's so

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
many pieces to what
he's talking about,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
but one thing is this whole
idea of cultural engineers.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I've always been highly suspect
of the culture, the celebrity

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
culture and a culture
which has hierarchy,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and where 1% of
the people matter,

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
people don't matter,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and they just watch the lives
of celebrities and drool,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and feel bad, and
hate them, and wanna

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
destroy them, because they
don't have what they have.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.974 align:middle line:90%
And I came back--

00:19:39.974 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't think that's healthy?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:90%
No, somehow, I don't.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And I came back from Congo,
and I'd been there a month,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and Congo's just such a--
it's a mind explosion on so

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.790 align:middle line:84%
many levels, because
it's desperately

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
poor, and desperately
chaotic, and anarchic,

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the most beautiful
and most loving people.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I come back,
I'm just flooded for days.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't how to
really adjust to come

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:90%
back to New York, particularly.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking--
I don't know.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason Terrence is
really speaking to me lately

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is I started to watch some TV
shows that were happening here,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and I just got so freaked out.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Every show just
seemed so cynical,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and the worse of
people, and celebrating

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:84%
the worst of people, and
this ongoing cynicism.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
Terrence-- I just

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:90%
love what he says, just unplug.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Like, refuse it.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't watch it.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.186 align:middle line:84%
Well, he also says culture
is your operating system.

00:20:38.186 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, but he also
says, it's not your friend.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It's your enemy, and
create your own culture.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Go out.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's why
I love this show.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Go out, and make
something that's

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
coming from your own heart,
and your own artistry,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and your own self, and
trust your small community.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Trust the smallness
of the community,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that there'll be many other
small communities that

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
will begin to create something.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think One Billion
Rising has really taught

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.937 align:middle line:90%
me that if you give people--

00:21:02.937 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't think
we're gonna give Johnny Carson

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
a run for his money here?
-You know what?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I actually do, but I think it
will come in a different kind

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
of way, hopefully, that it
won't be based on people selling

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
while you're talking, and it
won't be based on transactions,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.027 align:middle line:84%
but it will be based
on transformation.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about this idea
of cultural engineering for one

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
second, and then we're
gonna take a little break

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and come back with
you and another guest.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, everything
I've ever done in my life

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that I've been happy
about has been accidental.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's come
from curiosity.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
It's come from-- like, I was
really interested in vaginas,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
so I started to
write about vaginas.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I had no desire to do
a play about vaginas.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:90%
It was just, like, wow.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Women were telling incredible
stories about their vaginas,

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
writing them down.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to
grow into something.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, people told
me when I began,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
no one will ever
come to this play.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Change the title.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying, what
am I gonna call it?

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:90%
The Pocketbook Monologues?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.526 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's about vaginas.

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not gonna be like one
of those gotcha things.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:84%
You get in the theater,
and it's like gotcha!

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:90%
It's vaginas!

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
discovered along the way

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is that when you do that thing
that you're most interested in,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and it is really
connected to some part

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
of your being and
your soul, it actually

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:90%
resonates with other people.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
If you told me when I started
the "The Vagina Monologues"

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago that it
would be in 50 languages,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that it would've been
formed in 207 countries,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
tha-- I've seen it
done in Pakistan.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it in China.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It's been done everywhere.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
There's some phenomena aspect
to it that is way beyond me.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do with curiosity,
and following a desire

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to know something,
and just going

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
with that, as opposed to
editing it, or challenging it.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same thing
with One Billion Rising.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I was like, look, there are one
billion women on the planet,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:84%
one out of three, who
have been raped or beaten,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
one billion women on the planet.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:90%
One billion!

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%
What is a billion?

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I kept thinking, like,
what is a billion?

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I would lie in bed at night.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I said,
well, what if we just invited

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:90%
a billion people to dance?

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Just to dance, and to say,
I'm releasing the shackles.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna go on the streets.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna go in my church.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.527 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna go in my mosque.

00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna go everywhere
in the world,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and just release these
shackles of bondage, of rape,

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and torture.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.955 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:23:19.955 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no idea
how it happened.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
You can say the internet, but
that's not how it happened.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.031 align:middle line:84%
It happened because I
listened to an instinct,

00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
then other people
listened to an instinct.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
They took it.
They made it theirs.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Everybody made it theirs, and
it just flew around the world.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
cultural engineers don't

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:90%
want that to happen, right?

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:84%
They have us hooked into a
system of buy-sell cynicism,

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:90%
buy-sell cynicism.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all bad.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't change anything.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
You won't ever change the world.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you
can change the world,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
you're somehow treated as
less than, and not cool,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and outside.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I can't even tell you how many
snarky things have been said

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
about my life, or me,
because I actually believe

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:90%
we can make the world better.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's just part of that
same cultural engineering

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:90%
that keeps everybody depressed.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what did I
read the other day?

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
That more people are
depressed in America?

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It will be the second
disability in five years.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Depression?

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how many
people are depressed

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
in this country of plenty?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:10%
So I think part of it is,
how do you unplug from that,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:10%
and begin to listen to your own
voice, and your own instincts,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:10%
and your own wisdom, and
start creating based on that

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:10%
without approval, and
without seeking approval

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.154 align:middle line:10%
from those cultural engineers?
-Awesome.

00:24:36.154 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, listen, thank you so much.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna have you back in a
few minutes with another guest.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.053 align:middle line:84%
It's so wonderful
to talk to you,

00:24:40.053 --> 00:24:41.219 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing
work you're doing.

Hey, everybody.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're back with Jerin
Arifa and Eve Ensler.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, Jerin, do
you wanna tell us

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about your
work, and your thoughts

00:25:54.070 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
around how Muslim women fit
into the picture of feminism?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, I just
wanna start by saying

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
how honored I am to sit next to
Eve Ensler, one of my sheroes.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I like to tell people
I have two jobs in marketing

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to support my feminism habit.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:10%
And my feminism
habit includes being

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:10%
on the board of the National
Organization for Women,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:10%
also being a convener for

and Allies Virtual
Chapter of NOW,

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.490 align:middle line:10%
which we're very excited about.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And some of my work, I
actually started my activism

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
in America, because of
"The Vagina Monologues,"

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
because of it V-Day.
So thank you.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.636 align:middle line:90%
So how did that happen?

00:26:39.636 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
You saw it somewhere,
and it inspired you?

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I went to Hunter
College, and they'd been

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:90%
doing it for many, many years.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Hunter's very liberal.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to get involved
doing marketing for them.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I got involved.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:84%
What was the experience
of seeing it like for you?

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
What was the impact
that it had on you?

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I think, like everybody
else, it's life changing.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many
male friends tell me

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that it was life
changing for them,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that they really got
it after seeing it.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
But what was the it for you?

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
For me, I think what it was,
was there were friends who were

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
involved in it who told me
that they were survivors,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:90%
because of the work I was doing.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But after watching the show,
and feeling that energy,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
they stood up, and said
that they were survivors.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was such an important
step in their healing.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what was the path that
then let you down since then?

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually have an
activist background because

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:90%
of my mother and grandmother.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So it just helped
me get involved

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:90%
with activism in America.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So then I became president of
the Hunter College Feminists

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Club, and we did lots
of fun activists things,

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
including that I was
one of two students

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to propose and help create the
CUNY-wide sexual assault policy

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:90%
for half a million students.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:90%
She's incredible.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And Jerin has an amazing
voice, and a very articulate,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:90%
powerful, fierce, brave voice.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:10%
Last year, when we did
One Billion Rising,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:10%
we were looking at a lot of the
intersections around violence

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:10%
against women, how it
impacts economic violence,

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:10%
how racism, how Islamophobia.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.224 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote a really
brilliant piece on Islamophobia.

00:28:26.224 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And you should talk about
that, because I think

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
to put that forward

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:90%
so we keep thinking about it.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a
lot of Islamophobia

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:90%
in American and beyond.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of it, as a Muslim
woman, I understand why.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
What happened in 9/11
and the terrorist attacks

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:84%
that have happened since
then have shaken all of us

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
to the core.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand how it's
human nature to react in anger,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and make this one
race as the other,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
because then maybe we
can protect ourselves.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, there's
more than a billion

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Muslims in the world.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And if each one of
them were a terrorist,

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.924 align:middle line:84%
we would be in a really
bad place right now.

00:29:05.924 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that also
translates into how

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:90%
women are viewed, Muslim women.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
They're viewed as very
passive, and abused,

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and religious, the
women that are treated

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
the worst of any culture.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And Eve knows this
better than anybody

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:90%
else-- that's just not true.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
In America, every
nine seconds, a woman

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:90%
is abused or sexually violated.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:90%
That's in America.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So to say one culture
is worse than another,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.470 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't help the
women of that culture.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's really just others
that entire culture,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and it makes the women
from that culture

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:84%
less likely to identify as
feminists, or to work with us.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they think, well,
they hate all of us.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Why would I wanna
work with them?

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:90%
I think that's so true.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading an
article today about Delhi.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I was in Delhi at the
moment that Jyoti had been

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:90%
murdered, like, right after.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredible
time to be--

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe tell people
what that story is.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Jyoti was a young woman who
got on the bus with her fiance,

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and she ended up being horribly
gang-raped and murdered.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And the trial was
just this week,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately, they've given
the death penalty to the people

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:90%
who raped and murdered her.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm very opposed to
the death penalty.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was in India at the moment
when the whole case exploded.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was so moved to see
the response of Indians,

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:90%
just the outpouring.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Every newspaper, every
magazine, every article

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.360 align:middle line:84%
was about rape and
sexual violence.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
To see an entire
country in uproar.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
giving speeches,

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this is the first
time I've ever seen this happen

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the world
where violence against women

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
has been on the front
pages every single day.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I would love this to
happen in America.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And people got so angry at
me that I would actually

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:90%
look to India for inspiration.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Heaven forbid America
would actually

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
look outside our
borders to be taught

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:90%
something from other people.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think we end up demonizing
and otherizing groups so often.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
People get categorized as
Muslim women, poor Muslim women,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:84%
African women, poor--
when in fact, violence

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
against women and
patriarchy happens

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:90%
to be universal and epidemic.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.996 align:middle line:84%
There isn't any culture
or country I've been to,

00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and I've been to many.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna ask if you
see any, in that sense,

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:84%
positive developments
over the last decade.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Are there indicators, or
trends, or statistics?

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it a flatline?

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Is it a positive?

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it a negative?

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there any cultural
shift happening?

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the deal.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
16 years ago, 30 years
ago, no one was talking

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:90%
about violence against women.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It was just ordinary.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:90%
It was just what happened.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, Susan Brownmiller,
for instance.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Right, but that was
like 20 years ago.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:90%
More like 30, probably.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:90%
30.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Susan Brownmiller
was like, obviously,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
the breakthrough book on
it. "Against Our Will"

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:90%
was the breakthrough book.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But that was the beginning
of consciousness.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.801 align:middle line:10%
But 30 years ago, even that,
it wasn't widely thought about,

00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:10%
or talked about.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:10%
So we're at a point now where
it is now front page news, where

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:10%
you have a Todd Aiken last
year, who comes out and talks

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:10%
about legitimate rape or
illegitimate rape, or imagined,

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.305 align:middle line:10%
and there's an immediate and
amazing response to that.

00:32:04.305 --> 00:32:06.315 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't happening
30 years ago, you know?

00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We know that more women
are reporting rapes.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that more people
are documenting rapes.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to tell it
there's more rape happening

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
or if more people
are reporting it.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
What hasn't changed
is patriarchy.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We have not undone the
constructs of patriarchy.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure you have this
experience everywhere.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps repeating itself.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of the
main avenues to do that?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about the
microfinance campaigns

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.479 align:middle line:84%
that were seeking to
empower poor women.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:32.645 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they
were the ones who

00:32:32.645 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
were getting most of the loans.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you see social trends or
ways that that empowerment

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:90%
can accelerate?

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.184 align:middle line:90%
Do you wanna answer that?

00:32:42.184 --> 00:32:43.560 align:middle line:90%
You can go ahead.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think
there's a lot of ways

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:90%
that we're empowering women.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
One is through voice,
and by telling stories,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and by trusting
their own experience,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and not cutting off their voice.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Someone earlier
was talking to me

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that all their
lives they felt constricted.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:84%
They had no voice,
and what they felt,

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and what they saw didn't matter,
and they were terrified to put

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:90%
it into the world.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
definitely changing.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we see many more artists
coming forward, many more

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:90%
women in positions of power.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think the internet has
really democratized opinions.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And women are having lots
of opinions on the internet.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I think also the more we look
at programs where women are

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
empowered economically, where
we're looking at just the whole

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
the military-industrial system
and how that is creating

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:84%
a culture of violence
everywhere in the world,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I think those are incredibly
important factors.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think building
communities and movements

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
where women do not feel alone--
one of the things about One

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Billion Rising is because
there was a world movement,

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
women in Mogadishu could rise,
because they were protected

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:90%
by the global cone, right?

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Women in Bangladesh could rise.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Women in Alabama could rise,
which is just as risky there.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we build
global communities,

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:84%
women feel safe within
those communities,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
because they're connected
to a bigger story.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
their terrible culture.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
the world culture.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I was curious also-- I mean,
I was thinking about how,

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
yes, in the US,
maybe in Europe also,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a negative animus
around Islamic civilization,

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Muslim culture.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
very unfortunate.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
one aspect of that

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
is the sense that
in Islamic cultures,

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:90%
women have less opportunity to--

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.741 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
not true at all.

00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Tell me about that.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:10%
Islam, when it came
around, gave women rights,

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:10%
like the right to
divorce, own property,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:10%
and do other things that
took Western nations

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:10%
centuries to get to that point.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:84%
In the Quran, it gives
women so many rights.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's patriarchy that has
taken that, and twisted it,

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and said--

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.260 align:middle line:84%
What are the rights that
it gives them, for example?

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Afghanistan,
you know, Malala was shot,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
because she was trying
to educate young girls.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.650 align:middle line:84%
In Islam, education and
learning is the same as prayer.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So these people who are
doing this violence,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
not only are they bad
patriarchs, they're actually

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
very un-Islamic, because they're
trying to stop these women

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:90%
from conducting prayer.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective, does it
makes sense, though, to refer

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:90%
always back to the Quran?

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Or in a way, I mean,
does an Islamic culture

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:84%
have to develop to where that's
a reference point, but not

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:90%
the reference point in a way?

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it has
to be individual.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm lucky where
I come from a family where

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:90%
religion wasn't forced on me.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It was something I chose.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I think I chose to be
Muslim, because I found

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:90%
it was so feminist, the Quran.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:90%
It was so empowering for me.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.525 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that before.

00:35:40.525 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It is so incredibly empowering.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:84%
All the rights that are
given to me by the Quran

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
are more than the American
government gives me.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
so many things

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that are cultural
that are talked

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.090 align:middle line:90%
about as if they're Islamic.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, female
genital mutilation,

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
nowhere to be found
in the religion,

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.875 align:middle line:84%
but there are places
in Africa where--

00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But I was curious
more about the positive

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:90%
rights that you feel are--

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, for example,
in Islam, every penny

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
a woman who earns
belongs to her.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else has
any right to that.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I choose to do whatever
I with my money.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's not reality
in a lot of Muslim cultures

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:84%
because of patriarchy.
-Mhm.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So from your perspective, how do
you spread this understanding,

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
or make it more
generally understood?

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.556 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about
education, but I

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:36.920 align:middle line:84%
think it's also about what Eve
did with me, this little girl

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:84%
from New York, giving
her voice in One

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Billion Rising, to allow
Muslim women feminists

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:90%
to tell her own stories.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I think it's so important.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I think so much that
happens in this culture,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:84%
people are speaking
for other people

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than allowing people
to speak for themselves.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of things that we're
working on more and more

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:84%
in V-Day, first of all
V-Day's owned by everybody,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:84%
so everybody's
having their voice.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like Jerin has taught
me so much about Muslim culture

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't know.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think why aren't we
learning from each other?

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We make all these assumptions
that just flat line experience

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and close doors, rather
than saying, oh, talk to me.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me about your culture.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your interpretation,
or your experience

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:84%
with your culture,
because everyone

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
has such different
experiences with culture.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, you go to
different Muslim countries,

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and how the Quran is interpreted
is completely different.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You go to Pakistan,
it's one thing.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:84%
You go to Bangladesh,
it's completely different.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.630 align:middle line:84%
You go to Turkey,
it's one thing.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
You go to wherever, it's
completely different.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think people's
experience in relationship

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to religion colors so
much of what it is,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and how it's practiced.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we make all these
assumptions here that, I think,

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
got brought on
very much by 9/11,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and this desire to have this
monolithic experience which

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
froze Islamic
people in one place,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and Americans in another,
as if Muslim people

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:90%
weren't Americans, you know?

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.154 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of it is how
do you engender conversation?

00:37:59.154 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple more
minutes here together today,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and I was curious.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So in this campaign,
this worldwide campaign

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're imagining, and
orchestrating, and bringing

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
into manifestation
against sexual violence,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.270 align:middle line:84%
what do you see would be
some milestones in the next 5

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.969 align:middle line:90%
or 10 years ago?

00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Where would you like to
see it 10 years from now,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and how would you actually
get to that point?

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think if we look
at last year and some

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
of the amazing results
of One Billion Rising,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:90%
we have seen laws change.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
We've seen coalitions built.
And I think coalition-building--

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
earlier about mind

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.270 align:middle line:90%
shifts and evolutionary leaps.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I think part of what we've done
in organizing in resistance

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:90%
is we've siloed things.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We put environmental
degradation over here,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and we put economic
injustice over here.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And we put Islamophobia
over here, and we put--

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.210 align:middle line:90%
but in fact, there's one story.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.050 align:middle line:84%
We're all in one
story, and I think

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
the more we can build coalitions
where everybody's included

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:84%
in the story, and everybody's
issues become integrated

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and connected to
everybody else's issues,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the more possibility
there is for radical,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.450 align:middle line:90%
revolutionary transformation.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think One Billion Rising
is doing that organically.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know how
dancing figures into it,

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.300 align:middle line:84%
but there's something
about the act of dancing

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:90%
that is liberatory.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:90%
It's so--

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Even to Black Sabbath?

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:90%
To anything.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think there is
a liberation of your body,

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.600 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a
liberation of your mind.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.520 align:middle line:90%
And so you get out of your silo.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Your body is your silo, right?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you dance, you
break out of that silo,

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and you begin to say, oh my god.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.590 align:middle line:90%
You're dancing too.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So what's your
connection to this?

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And you're dancing.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.637 align:middle line:90%
You're 14.

00:39:35.637 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:90%
What's your connection to this?

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to see
all these places where you're

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
rooted and
interconnected, and then

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.830 align:middle line:84%
the movement gets enlarged,
and the energy gets enlarged.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And I was just looking
at the videos of women

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:10%
in wheelchairs dancing, and
then cut to men just boogieing

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of streets.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.963 align:middle line:84%
And then you're in the middle
of a desert, and there are--

00:39:54.963 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:90%
What's the URL again for that?

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
-Onebillionrising.org
-Nice one.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
last comment to add?

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.875 align:middle line:84%
You know, the most
important reason Islam

00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
is feminist is because
one of the main beliefs

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is you can't fight with
the oneness of God,

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.780 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's
only God above you.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And if I put a man
above me, that just
