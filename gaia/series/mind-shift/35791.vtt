00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Hey, everybody.
Welcome to "Mind Shift."

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a new talk show that
asks questions about what's

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.870 align:middle line:90%
happening on Earth and why.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to be exploring

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:84%
the psychic experience
and shamanism.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
This has obviously been a
major part of my past work.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
For my first book,
"Breaking Open the Head,"

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I visited tribal people in
Africa, Mexico, and the Amazon,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:84%
where we explored visionary
plant substances like iboga,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms, and ayahuasca.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Since that book came
out over 10 years ago,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the popular interest
in shamanic practices

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelic plants has
flourished and blossomed.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:84%
There's also been a resurrection
of scientific research

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
of the medical value of
psychedelic substances.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Together, we're going
to take a little dive

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:90%
into contemporary shamanism.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore
the evolving interest

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
in visionary plant
medicines and also discuss

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of journeys people
have with these substances,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
which can be amazingly
transformative or sometimes

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:90%
woefully ineffective.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.922 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
Hey, everybody.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Time Drift"--
I mean "Mind Shift."

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, our first guest is the
extraordinary musician Ben Lee.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:84%
He's made an amazing
new album, "Welcome

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Work," about his
ayahuasca experiences.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be discussing
shamanism, visionary culture,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:90%
whatever else comes to mind.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so happy
you could join us.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Born on
September 11, 1978,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Ben Lee is an award-winning
Australian musician and actor.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:10%
Not only does Ben have
an obsession for music,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:10%
he is also extremely passionate
about esoteric science,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:10%
the workings of the
human mind and spirit.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:10%
In 2003, after meeting a
spiritually enlightened

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.022 align:middle line:10%
Indian avatar, he
was inspired to make

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:10%
his notable album "Ayahuasca."

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Called his most
experimental work,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
this album marries his music
with his spiritual beliefs

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and practices.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, Lee was a
mentor on the hit

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Australian TV show "The Voice."

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
He has also won many
ARIA Music Awards

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
for his song "Catch My
Disease" and the album

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.887 align:middle line:90%
"Awake is the New Sleep."

00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:44.811 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Ben, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.471 align:middle line:84%
I hope you like our little
mini media empire here.

00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I love it.
It's very professional.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Nice, nice.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So I yeah, talk
about your new album

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
led you to make it.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I make this
record, "Ayahuasca,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the Work."

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:10%
And it was somewhat
of a scary journey,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:10%
both conceptually and
creatively, in that obviously

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:10%
there are consequences to
coming out of the closet,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:10%
not just in relationship
to ayahuasca or ceremonial

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:10%
medicines, but just in terms
of prioritizing consciousness

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:10%
and the awakening of
consciousness as such

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:10%
a dominant passion in my work
and my life, in that it does

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:10%
sort of put you a little
bit on the fringe of what,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.074 align:middle line:10%
as someone who-- I always wanted
to be Michael Jackson or Elvis

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:10%
or Kurt Cobain or
something, like, you know,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:10%
a mainstream rock star.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And that didn't really happen.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a leap
for me to think, wow,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm really speaking
about stuff that

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
is a really fringe interest.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's been really satisfying
to-- you know, while it is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
definitely the record that's
probably sold the least

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
amount of copies of any
of my albums so far,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
it has really connected with
people that understand what

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
it's about and understand why
an experience like the ayahuasca

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
journey would be as provocative
as was that I'd want to sort

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of make art in tribute to it.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Is was a big-- yeah,
it's a big journey.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
When you say consequences, the
main one you're talking about

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
is being a little bit
kind of marginalized

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
or not being as kind of
central to the mainstream

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:90%
culture's concerns?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think it's
like it's marginalized.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of-- when you start

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
dealing with consciousness,
like the fear

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that comes up for me is, oh,
people are gonna hate it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, people
are just gonna ignore it.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Why do you say consciousness
instead of a term

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.582 align:middle line:90%
like spirituality or something?

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:40.315 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean in that
context by "consciousness?"

00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for me consciousness just
means awareness, an awareness

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of the truth.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think no matter
where you look,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in terms of
the state of the environment

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
or the economy or politics or,
in a larger cosmic sense, what

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
is our relationship to a greater
meaning or understanding,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
we clearly are not as aware as
we could be of our potential

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and are not living a life
that probably is as, you know,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
as healing or as
generous or as nurturing

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
as we're capable of doing.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I like the
word "consciousness,"

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
because it just applies
becoming conscious.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say that
necessarily, this

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
is what you'll find when you
become conscious, that you'll

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:90%
meet Jesus or Buddha.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It just-- to become conscious
is just to become aware.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about ayahuasca.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
For people who don't
know about it so much,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
how would you describe it
to somebody who's new to it

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:90%
or just learning about it?

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well,
ayahuasca is a tool.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a technique.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're very
lucky in the world

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to have so many beautiful
techniques, especially

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
the ancient ones that
have been handed down,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's breath or
meditation or mantra

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
or some of these
ceremonial medicines.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
They all do similar
things or are

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
capable of doing
similar things, and that

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is take us into amplified
states of consciousness.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer the term
"amplified states"

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
rather than "altered states,"
because the great techniques,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like ayahuasca, they utilize
the neurochemical DMT, which

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is already active
in the human mind.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
What's DMT?

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
DMT is this, you know,
dimethyltryptamine.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that
it's what's released

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
by the pineal gland that
gives us these elevated states

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
of insight.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I like the
term "amplified states

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness," because the
same reason meditation-- it's

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
not showing you something
completely other than what

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
we ordinarily experience.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just exaggerating
it so that we perhaps

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
get a more acute
sense of what is

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:90%
occurring in our inner world.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And how did you first come
to have that experience?

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I first was
introduced to ayahuasca

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
through a friend
of mine, who really

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:84%
just-- it was because I saw
some real changes in his life.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I've always had the-- I've
been very open to trying

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
different things, but I've had
a pretty strict criteria of what

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
would take in that I need to
see real changes in someone

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
becoming happier and
healthier and more integrated

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
as the kind of, you know--
in terms of what's vouching

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:90%
for that particular modality.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
friend, I saw

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
he'd sort of stopped
drinking and stopped smoking

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
pot and stopped womanizing.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
His priority-- he had sort of
started thinking about giving

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:90%
back to his community.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like, hey, something
real is going on here.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.007 align:middle line:84%
So that was what first
drew me into participating.

00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that particular friend,
now that you've been involved

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.606 align:middle line:84%
with it for a while, have
you found that a lot,

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that people have
lifestyle changes

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that seem to occur
when they have

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.105 align:middle line:90%
these types of experiences?

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it
seems absolutely

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that at least in the short
term, ayahuasca opens people

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
up to thinking about
the world in a more

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:90%
interconnected manner.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I am a firm believer in a
daily spiritual practice,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
as I am in traditional
psychotherapy.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I think
ayahuasca combined

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
with some of these other things
is actually the most effective.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Because what you sometimes
find is that it gives people

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
such peak experiences,
but they don't really

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
have any tools to integrate it.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they also don't
have the skills

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to interpret the experience.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.935 align:middle line:84%
Because all mystical experience
going back to the Old Testament

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, they all
required interpretation.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
None of them were just
simply God saying, well,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
this is how it is,
do this, do that.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that takes that
literally, I think,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:84%
is really missing the hidden
teachings in the religions.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
So for me--

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
When you do
ayahuasca, you usually

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
do it with a guide or a
shaman or somebody who helps

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:90%
create that interpretation.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well that's true, but
that only often addresses

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
the immediate 24 hours
or the period where

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:90%
someone's sitting in ceremony.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
For me, the first
ceremony I sat,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
it really took me probably
two years of interpretation

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and wrestling with
and meditation

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to get some hint of what had
happened to me that evening.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It was that overpowering.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
It was that overpowering.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was that--
it was literally,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
like I felt that I just
saw the tip of the iceberg

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of the unconscious mind.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was still much more
than I'd ever imagined

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
was inside me.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important to approach all

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
of these techniques with
a really healthy respect

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and a humility and not think
they're things that we can just

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:84%
either use as a
quick fix, you know,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.355 align:middle line:84%
a pill that will give us
immediate enlightenment

00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or solve all our
problems, but also

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that we should really contain
within a safe structure.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like the
shaman that you sort of

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
worked with has really
provided like a whole kind

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
of set of ideas and techniques.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost more like a
school or a learning experience

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
than just like these ceremonies
that are disconnected.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well it's
really interesting

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that in the modern
world, we've sort

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of thrown the baby
out with the bathwater

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:90%
in terms of tradition.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:10%
And there are all these great
postmodern ideas that we create

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:10%
our own reality and we
can pick and choose,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:10%
but some of what we miss is the
surrender that these systems

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.354 align:middle line:10%
provide us with.

00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman who
I've worked with

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is very much into integrating
the ayahuasca experience

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
into a larger concept
of traditional Buddhism

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric science
and gnosticism

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that a lot
of these ancient traditions

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.385 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to teach us
about what we can and can't

00:10:32.385 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:90%
trust in our own mind.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think ayahuasca's
really interesting because it

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
kind of dumps you
into your imagination

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and into your own mind.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I think people learn

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
after a lot of work
with the medicine

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
is that not everything
you see can be trusted.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, everyone's
like, I got the guidance!

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
start this business

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and become a millionaire.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.126 align:middle line:84%
And then they do it,
and they're like,

00:10:54.126 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:90%
huh, why didn't that work?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there perhaps isn't the
questioning or the vigilance

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
against our own mind
and our own ego that

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
some of these older
systems provide

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:90%
us with tools to work with.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing
that's often very

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
important about these
types of ceremonies

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is the music or the
sound component.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering how you
related to that as a musician,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
if it's impacted how you
think about music and so on.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd say ayahuasca
completely revolutionized

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.995 align:middle line:90%
the way I think about music.

00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess just in
the power of beauty

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
in music, in that I
came up through punk

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
rock and underground
music, and a lot of it

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is very referential and ironic
and cynical and playful.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And those can all be
great qualities in art.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But for me, with the music that
has been really transcendent

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
in ceremony is music that's just
beautiful and really glorifies

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
the human spirit
and the human psyche

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and what we're capable of.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of set a
whole new bar for me

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to attempt to stumble towards.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm still working with
sort of the rudimentary tools

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.615 align:middle line:84%
of my underground punk rock
training but trying to bring

00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
it-- edge it towards
this other goal.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
There's often something
kind of unusual

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:90%
about the music in ceremony.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
like typical harmonic

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Western harmonics, right?

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.381 align:middle line:84%
It has like a different kind
of a tonal structure almost,

00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well I think
sacred music throughout

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
many different cultures
has often had a almost

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:90%
counterintuitive feel to it.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not designed to necessarily
be pleasing in the way

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're used to a
pop song being pleasing.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Like a pop song-- and
I studied pop songs

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to write hits
and all that for years.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
write hits anymore?

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, I'm
open to it, just

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
in case whatever the spirits of
pop song, of one-hit-wonderness

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
are listening.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm open to it, but
it's not the craft.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed with
the craft, you know?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed
to work in the way

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
that a great commercial
works, you know?

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a marketing tool in that
it's got to hook you in really

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
quickly, it's got to provide
you with some immediate

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
gratification, and
then at the same time,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
hopefully it plants a seed of
like real human tenderness.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But sacred music does
something totally different,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
which I feel is it--
it reconnects us

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
with God in whatever
sense that we find that.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.355 align:middle line:84%
Would the Ben Lee of 10 years
ago have been kind of shocked

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and horrified to hear you
make that statement now?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a straight continuity?

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's really funny,
because I've gone through a lot

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
of phases with spirituality.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I've been
very guarded with it.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think in general
with my career,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I've always taken the
perspective of just

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:90%
having my heart on my sleeve.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So whether that was
falling in love with a girl

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or meeting a guru in India or
getting heartbroken or wanting

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to be ambitious,
like I just wrote

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
about what I was
passionate about,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.265 align:middle line:84%
And I think that side has been
a real through-line in my career

00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:50.687 align:middle line:90%
and hasn't really changed.

00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever fallen in
love with an ambitious guru

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.651 align:middle line:84%
in India?
-Huh.

00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Huh.
That's a good one.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
next concept album.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Who was your guru in India?

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
is a teacher who I've

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%
been seeing for about 10 years.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I actually just got
back from taking my wife

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and my two daughters, my
daughter and stepdaughter,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:90%
for the first time as a family.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.716 align:middle line:84%
And that's been an
incredible experience.

00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, interestingly,
that experience

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
when I met-- you
know, often you have

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
these ideals about
the spiritual path,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and when I met
[INAUDIBLE], I thought,

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.531 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is like-- I've got to
renounce all my worldly goals

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things Amma said to me was,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
has Ben Lee ever been top ten?

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, Amma.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was just funny hearing
this like young Indian man

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in rural India talking about
commercial success in that way.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And Amma said, put Amma's
message into music,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.052 align:middle line:84%
and Amma will bless
Ben to be top 10.

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:46.085 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's the message?

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And Amma said joy.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I then wrote six or seven
songs in the next few weeks

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and made this record called
"Awake is the new Sleep" that

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
debuted at number seven
in the Australian charts,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
went up to number
two, when Top 10

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:90%
in the Netherlands and Spain.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I say all
this because there's

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
a continuum of this whole
journey for me, which

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
is understanding that the
science or the patterns

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that we encounter in our
careers, in our relationship,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
in our spiritual life,
they're not the ones

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
that are on the surface.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
great teachers-- and I

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
would include ayahuasca in
that as a great teacher--

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
they give you a little hint
of the gears that are going

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
behind the screen or
behind the surface

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that are actually causing
life to happen as we see it.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I guess having-- I
mean, I wrote in my book

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
"Breaking Open
The Head" in 2002.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I guess I started
taking ayahuasca

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:90%
in '99 or '98 or something.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's been interesting
seeing it over the years.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Like at first, nobody seemed
to know about it for the most

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
part, and now it's like a
vine that's moving quickly,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
like snaking its way through
all these different aspects

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.984 align:middle line:84%
of our culture and into
even very elite sectors.

00:15:47.984 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:90%
But are you seeing that also?

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing more and
more people finding it?

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- in a way, it's
almost like a trend in the way

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.531 align:middle line:84%
maybe yoga was in like the late
'70s or something, you know,

00:15:58.531 --> 00:15:59.543 align:middle line:84%
or '80s.
-I know, yeah.

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a mixture of being sort
of-- I feel a warmth about that

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
because the most
optimistic side of me

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
hopes that people will
experience the highest

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
experience that's
possible in the sense

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of a real opening of the
heart and a realignment

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:90%
of priorities.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a healthy
skepticism about it, I suppose,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
in that I know that the tool
itself, while it's powerful,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
it's equally powerful because
of what it's contained in.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And if it loses touch
with the real goal, which

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
is the enlightenment of the
human mind and the human heat,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
then it's in danger of becoming
corrupted and just becoming

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
another way for
people to get kicks

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and to sort of escape
from their daily life.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So I'm cautious, you know?

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm optimistic, but I'm cautious
about what it all means.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think as a matter of
fact, your particular shaman

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
had said something to that
effect, right, that in a sense,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
it was possible that ayahuasca
was only going to be valuable

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years or something,
because eventually

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.511 align:middle line:84%
it would get corrupted by the
modern world. is that right?

00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's
just based on the idea

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
that essentially, never
underestimate the human being's

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
ability to corrupt anything.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.445 align:middle line:84%
We've basically been able to
find all of these pure tools

00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
and pure stories and
pure states and degrade

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:90%
them in various ways.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.711 align:middle line:84%
So there is a pattern there
that we have to be aware of.

00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.709 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you look at them,

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
and I guess I've always
felt and kind of reflected

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
this idea in my
books, that if we look

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
at the ecological crisis
and it's kind of, you know,

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
ever-growing kind of onslaught,
we need some type of medicine

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to shift our psyche.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca-- and many
people, and how you feel,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
talk about it as maybe
like the spirit of nature

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or like the voice of
the mother, in a way.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Like if it's not ayahuasca,
I don't really see what

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be at this point.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I share your hope about that.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, I really hope
that's how it plays out.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I guess this is where
the implementation

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of the experience becomes
important, because we have

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
these strong internal
experiences with the medicine

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
or with meditation, and if we
then-- if we then basically

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
release ourselves of the
responsibility that comes

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
with that type of insight,
I don't think the world

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:90%
will really transform.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Because as far as I see
it, and I think the way

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I see it is not that
radical in terms

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
spirituality, that the reason

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
for the destruction
in the environment

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:90%
is there is a reason.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's an inner reason.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:90%
It's our own greed.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It's our own desires.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.215 align:middle line:84%
It's our own lust for power
and our lust for material--

00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:90%
you know, material objects.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And all that really
just being based,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
according to a different
mystical traditions,

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:90%
on our ignorance, right?

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, but that we have
to first and foremost tackle

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:90%
those things within ourself.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And I am wary of people coming
back from mystical experiences

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
as like crusaders for good!

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And the problems
are all out there.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if there's one thing
that the ayahuasca has shown me

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:90%
it's that the problem's in here.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I have all those things that
I'm seeing out in the world.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I am afflicted by
those desires and those

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
corruptions the same
as the guy who's

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:90%
bulldozing down the Amazon.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the point
of spirituality,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can
see, is to tackle

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:90%
those things within myself.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, I can hear that, but
I can also-- would also

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
argue that unfortunately, you
also see people getting kind

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of in this endless
loop of inner healing

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that just becomes kind
of like in a sense

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
another kind of
solipsism or narcissism.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So like if we're never going
to attain some perfect state

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of health-- maybe that
doesn't even really exist--

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
then when do we know
that we're healed

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
enough that we can crusade or--

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you, and I
think there is a difference

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
between using spiritual
tools for healing and using

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:90%
them for enlightenment.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I think healing is the
loop people get stuck in.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Healing happens automatically
on the spiritual path.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
As we try and-- you know, if we
keep our mind on-- and again,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:84%
some people are more comfortable
than other with the word God.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
comfortable with it.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I feel
like it's more been

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.561 align:middle line:84%
corrupted through use of like
evangelicals and literalists,

00:20:02.561 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:90%
but I--

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to you exactly?

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, to me it's the
great order of the thing

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:10%
that we're in.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what it is,
but it's like it's not me.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.534 align:middle line:10%
I'm not the boss of it.

00:20:11.534 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
There's something else
out there that's--

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:90%
But there is a boss.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, a boss or a trend.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it a trend, you know?

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
There are trends that
are not in my control.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And I call that God.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
I've always seen that--

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
piss the boss off?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we-- I think we
have been pissing the boss off.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's clearly
like part of the reason

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
why-- I don't know.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel myself, when I get out of
alignment, say with my career,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
when I get too prideful or too
making it all about my ego,

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm in for a humbling.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.097 align:middle line:84%
It's happened time and
time again in my career.

00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Yogananda who said

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.561 align:middle line:84%
that life was a continual
choice between humility

00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or humiliation.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's that other--
and Chogyam Trungpa

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.221 align:middle line:84%
said meditation is just
one insult after another.

00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-So it's the same thing.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It's that like basically if we
pull ourselves out of alignment

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
individually or
collectively, we're

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in for a karmic punishing.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I think like the goal
of this kind of work-- yeah,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
healing is important,
but I think

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to actually allow the greater
system to work through

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:90%
us should be our real goal.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's been awesome
to talk to you.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a little pause

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and stow you away
in a safe place

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and bring on Ross Brockley,
talk to him for a bit,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.605 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll be back on and
we'll have a little dialogue.

00:21:28.605 --> 00:21:29.964 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:29.964 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Ross Brockley is
a comedian and vegetable

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:90%
farmer from Nebraska.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:84%
He has opened for many notable
comics, such as Louis CK,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and has appeared in
feature films as well.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:10%
His most recent film, "Sick
Birds Die Easy," directed

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:10%
by Nick Fackler,
chronicles the adventures

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:10%
of a group of
artists and misfits

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:10%
to a tiny village
in Gabon, Africa.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:10%
There, they experience
the psychedelic properties

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:10%
of the iboga plant, which
is native to Western Central

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:10%
Africa and has been used in
Bwiti religious ceremonies

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.895 align:middle line:10%
for thousands of years.

00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:01.859 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Ross, great to meet you.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much for coming.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you are the featured
star in this new art film,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
"Sick Birds Die Easy."
-That's right.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Which is set in
the wilds of Gabon

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:10%
on a hunt for the
sacred iboga plant.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.102 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit about
the film and your role in it.

00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Uh, OK.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.900 align:middle line:10%
My friend Nick lives in Omaha.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:10%
I live in Lincoln, Nebraska.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:10%
And he called me up and
said he wants to go to Gabon

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:10%
and take iboga and
make a movie about it.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So he had kind of a
loose script and I said

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:90%
sure, and, uh, off we went.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
In the film, you're
depicted as a drug

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
fiend, diligent pot dealer, who
has many forms of addictions.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you're
actually a farmer.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And based on a true story.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And so were you excited?

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Had you wanted to try
iboga for a long time?

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I never heard of it.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd tried ayahuasca once,
and I'd never heard of iboga.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:90%
So I started reading about it.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was up for it for sure.
-Cool.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
How was your
ayahuasca experience?

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.819 align:middle line:84%
-Total dud.
-Dud?

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:19.229 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-OK.

00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:20.601 align:middle line:84%
And, um--
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.601 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a shame.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So what emerged in the film
was-- so when I saw the film,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
actually, I hadn't really paid
that close attention to like

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:90%
the liner notes or whatever.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I assumed it was
essentially a documentary.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
met today, it turns

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
out that it's actually more of
a kind of a fictional construct.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's parts
of it-- it's true.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We did go over there, and I
did go through the ceremony

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that, but, uh, no, we

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
were just kind of making
a film, just a narrative

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
comedy or whatever.
-I see, OK.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so for you,
doing the iboga over there

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and the ceremony, it
wasn't like a real--

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
you weren't really like
going for it in a sense for--

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
No, I was definitely
going for it, yeah.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But how was that experience
for you in reality,

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:90%
then, the iboga?

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It was just another bust.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.061 align:middle line:90%
I'm 0 for 2.

00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry to hear that.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.371 align:middle line:84%
I hope at some point we can
like pop your shamanic cherry

00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
with like some--

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.103 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't-- I don't get
on with shamans very well.

00:24:14.103 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Really?
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.740 align:middle line:90%
They always end up hating me.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.708 align:middle line:84%
What is it about you
that drives them so mad?

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.134 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You'd have to ask them.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.344 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
-All right.

00:24:23.344 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So, well, how was
it to be in Gabon?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was great.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a rainforest
meets the ocean,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and, uh, it's beautiful,
really good, really fun.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.101 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, in the film, you
guys go on like this long trek

00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
through the jungle.
You get hopelessly lost.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:90%
There's like a death.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But all of that was just
filmed nearby your hotel.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.381 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Right, cool.

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And there was a kind
of Hunter S. Thompson

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
vibe of like dereliction
and decadence

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:90%
and kind of like degeneracy.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.524 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there is.

00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Nice, nice.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But some of that
was true, you know?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't all faked.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, so maybe
tell me a little bit more

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.461 align:middle line:84%
about-- so iboga
didn't work for you.

00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
-No.
-No.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
-Ayahuasca didn't work for you.
-No.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.715 align:middle line:90%
Have you smoked DMT?

00:25:05.715 --> 00:25:06.871 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
That worked.

00:25:06.871 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Nice.
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:90%
ROSS BROCKLEY: No, that's good.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:90%
What did that do for you?

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
That just-- I took
a bong hit of it,

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.665 align:middle line:84%
and my whole body
filled up immediately.

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:90%
I just had to hit the deck.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't even
finish the hit.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And maybe 10 minutes of
just kind of psychedelia.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelia.
ROSS BROCKLEY: Yeah.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.755 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Nice.
Right on.

00:25:30.755 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:90%
ROSS BROCKLEY: It was great.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so like, well,
tell me a little bit more

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:84%
about your experience
doing the film.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so the character
you were playing

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:90%
was like a you but a not you?

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was kind of
based on me, I guess.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But he told me to-- I'm a drug
addict, is what the idea was.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was being cured
of my drug addiction.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And the drug we chose
that was my drug of choice

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:90%
was OxyContin.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.835 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know how
to play an OxyContin head.

00:25:59.835 --> 00:26:01.395 align:middle line:90%
I was just taking naps a lot.

00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:05.786 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me taking a
nap and go, because of the Oxy,

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Ross was always taking a nap,
you know, in the narration.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But um, I've never
done OxyContin,

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
so I really don't know what
that's all about, but, um.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.281 align:middle line:84%
-Awesome.
-Is it?

00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Sure.
Oh, I don't know-- OxyContin?

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I think I tried it once
and it wasn't awesome.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.649 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It was, you know, it definitely
make you feel medicated.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Big Pharma.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.549 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:31.111 align:middle line:84%
And this film is now garnering
prizes left and right,

00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I understand.
-Yeah.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
He worked on it for two years,
and we had a couple rough cuts.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, worst movie
I've ever seen at first,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and then he kept going,
and he refined it.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he must have just
kind of figured it out.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it won the Poland
International Film Festival

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:90%
grand prize or whatever.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And and then now it's premiering
at Woodstock next week

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
or two weeks or
something like that.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Right on.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.874 align:middle line:84%
Cool. yeah, I had a sense
that-- well, I mean, so for Nick

00:27:02.874 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and for other people
involved in the film, I mean,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:84%
there was an
interest in shamanism

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and these kind of ancient
traditions and so on.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was, but,
um-- yeah, there was, sure.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:90%
What's the but?

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.408 align:middle line:90%
Uh, no, I'm not-- nothing.

00:27:16.408 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So just a minute
ago we had Ben Lee

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
up here talking about
like kind of spirituality

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and ceremony and ritual.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think
about all that stuff?

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.446 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where do you stand
on this whole God question?

00:27:30.446 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm a farmer.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I live with God every day.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Birds and bees and butterflies--
I can see it every day,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in tune with it.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And you got other
plans, movies,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:90%
other dramatic escapades?

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Um, "Sick Birds Die
Easier" with Russell Brand.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.463 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't get
to meet him, so I

00:27:53.463 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know if we're gonna
be able to pull that off,

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
but yeah.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.574 align:middle line:90%
What would be the theme there?

00:27:57.574 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
How would that-- what was
the narrative structure?

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Probably ayahuasca,
I guess, you know?

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.359 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Try that, and go over there
with, uh, and try that one.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.695 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, he really
wants to try it,

00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:90%
he says, but he just can't.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because he's in AA.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that doesn't matter.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:84%
-No?
-Does it?

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
an abstinent policy.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I know
a number of people

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
who are in AA who are really
dying to try ayahuasca

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and other shamanic medicines,
but it's a total violation

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:26.915 align:middle line:90%
of the principles.

00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, like the 13--
he's a 13-stepper?

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I think-- is it 13?

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a number of steps.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's got steps.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.068 align:middle line:84%
-OK.
-Yeah.

00:28:38.068 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Um, cool, and so tell me a
little bit about the French guy

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:90%
who was in the film.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Uh, yeah, he-- Tatyo.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So is he actually like
what he's portrayed?

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very much so.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So he's a shaman there in
[INAUDIBLE], they're called?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And he-- he was great.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
He welcomed us and was
very hospitable at first.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd read
about this Bwiti faith

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.784 align:middle line:84%
that they have in Africa,
and that's kind of based--

00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:05.716 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I actually went through
an iboga initiation myself.

00:29:05.716 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's the Bwitis, right?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
They have a religion
based on this plant.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I read a book about
it before we left,

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and then I knew that Bwiti was--
they'd always said that Bwiti

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
encourages you to completely
speak your mind wherever

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
you-- whenever you want.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of how I
approached my interactions

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:90%
with these people.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think I might
have overdone it.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually he
started to kind of dislike me.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I just know, you know.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
You know. [LAUGHS] And
so I was the only one

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:90%
that did the ceremony.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.563 align:middle line:84%
From the film, it looked
like he had a whole community

00:29:43.563 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of Europeans who'd
been like addicts who

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
were now living
with him and doing

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the Bwiti ceremonies and so on.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
When you spoke your
mind and kind of

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
pissed him off or
alienated him, like what

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:90%
were you talking about?

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.391 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, 9/11 or whatever,
just politics, probably.

00:29:58.391 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And--
-Oh, right.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that I remember,
in the film you

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.014 align:middle line:84%
have a whole conspiracy-minded
kind of thing.

00:30:05.014 --> 00:30:06.479 align:middle line:84%
Like you like to talk--
-Who doesn't?

00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.281 align:middle line:84%
Secret government and 9/11
and financial shenanigans,

00:30:11.281 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff.
-Yeah.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's true to life.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.779 align:middle line:84%
-Israel.
-Right on.

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:16.770 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Cool.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So you must feel comfortable
right here down near Ground

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Zero doing this show.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.321 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe not
perfectly, but, uh, sure.

00:30:27.321 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you think is
happening on the world stage,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
then, in terms of
the city government

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and the Illuminati
and all that stuff?

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.971 align:middle line:84%
I don't go for the
Illuminati thing too much.

00:30:35.971 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just over
there fighting Israel's wars.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I think they're-- I
think they're urging

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:90%
us to kill all their enemies.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking about this
kind of stuff with the French--

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.704 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he's a Jewish guy,
and I wanted to say, you know,

00:30:51.704 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- I'm not talking
about Jewish people.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the state of Israel.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, he just-- he
just wasn't going for it.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he didn't give
me the good stuff.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Was the actual
idea of the film is

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you were supposed to have this
cathartic, transformational

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:90%
experience at the end?

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that
was even scripted.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But the idea was we were
gonna see what happens,

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and we were gonna
try-- I was gonna do it

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and that would
have been, I guess,

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the documentary part about
what really did happen there.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't planning on faking
anything with the initiation.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But gave you like--
you think he gave

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:90%
you like the unleaded iboga.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I think so, yeah.
I know so.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.514 align:middle line:90%
He gave me the bark.

00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Well, it is bark.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.169 align:middle line:84%
That's what it is.
-Yeah, I know.

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The iboga part's
the center core.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So you just sat
there sick on bark?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:10%
I just sat there kind
of faking it, you know,

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:10%
and laying there for three
hours and just-- you know,

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and then I figured it out.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.139 align:middle line:84%
-So no visions?
-No-- zip.

00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:55.176 align:middle line:90%
No spirits of your ancestors?

00:31:55.176 --> 00:31:56.978 align:middle line:84%
-Nothing, nothing, nothing.
-No.

00:31:56.978 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.547 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
I'm, you know, sorry.

00:32:00.547 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It was disappointing.
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Because I would love to do it.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.734 align:middle line:84%
I'll maybe try it again
someday if we get over there.

00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, awesome.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.491 align:middle line:84%
It's a little disappointing
as a conversation stopper.

00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-But, uh.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a little discussion
with some other filmmakers

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.231 align:middle line:84%
and Ben Lee, and we'll
see where it goes.

00:32:16.231 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:84%
-OK.
-Yeah, yeah. yeah.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be right
back with Ben Lee.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And also we're bringing
Stuart Braunstein on,

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
who's a producer of "Don
Peyote," another film

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
much like "Sick Birds Die
Easy," which combines kind

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.546 align:middle line:84%
of shamanic experience into a
kind of improvisational comedy

00:32:31.546 --> 00:32:33.334 align:middle line:84%
structure.
So we'll be right back.

00:32:33.334 --> 00:32:38.174 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:38.174 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:10%
MAN: He is the king of
the world in right action.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And she is the moon among the
sacred alphabets of compassion.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.388 align:middle line:84%
They treasured their
secrets like pierced rubies

00:33:00.388 --> 00:33:02.356 align:middle line:90%
but found little peace.

00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:05.308 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:05.308 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So here we are back with
the cast of Beatlemania.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.670 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you guys.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:10%
Stuart, you wanna
maybe talk a little bit

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:10%
about your shamanism work?

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, actually, it
all happened at once

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:10%
because-- sort of because
of you in a weird way.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:10%
So, you know,
basically I met Daniel,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and this is at a
time when I was-- I

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:10%
had this building called
Collective Hardware.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.805 align:middle line:84%
And it was an insane asylum,
but a beautiful insane asylum.

00:33:29.805 --> 00:33:32.745 align:middle line:84%
It had galleries and
post-production facilities,

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was just like this
culture in New York City.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, I met him,
and he's like, oh,

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you gotta check out this
shaman stuff, you know?

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And he started getting in my
year about all this stuff.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, ah,
it's hippie stuff.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I was too busy doing a
lot of cocaine back then,

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
so I wasn't that interested
in anything psychedelic

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
at that moment, you know?

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But it just-- he kept on
talking to me about it,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and I started liking
the ideas about it.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Then I started watching
documentaries about it.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, wow, this is
quite interesting, you know?

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because to be
honest, I love drugs, always.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:90%
I love drugs.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.334 align:middle line:84%
And I was always looking to
get an out-of-body experience.

00:34:11.334 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I just was using the wrong ones.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And, uh--

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.719 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of funny, actually,
when I saw "Sick Birds"

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.675 align:middle line:90%
and Ross' character--

00:34:18.675 --> 00:34:19.854 align:middle line:90%
It reminds you of me? [LAUGHS]

00:34:19.854 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like thought
about you a little bit,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because he was
like a drug-loving,

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of post Hunter
S. Thompson-ish,

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, slightly tragic
figure, who, um, you know,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
was seeking redemption
through some type

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of shamanic excursion, you know?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it was all--
you know, it was all fun,

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:84%
man, and I don't regret any of
it, but um, all of a sudden,

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
then you introduced
me to the medicine.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And I took this medicine,
and I was like, whoa!

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I really resonated
with the idea.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
I really resonated
with this world.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It really, really showed me
the other dimension in such a

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:90%
really clear, beautiful way.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.737 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was at home.
And then--

00:34:59.737 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's just hold
up for a little bit.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna ask-- I
was gonna ask Ben.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you heard
Ross' story, what would

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:90%
be kind of your advice to him?

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.351 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had two misses
on this shamanic path here,

00:35:11.351 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I don't
know about iboga.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.890 align:middle line:84%
With ayahuasca, it's
not for everybody.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think
there's a-- I think

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:10%
it's a mistake with
any spiritual modality

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:10%
to think that everybody
should be doing the same thing

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:10%
and using the same tools.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And that may have
very well just been

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:84%
bumping into something that was
not meant to be in his journey.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really have any
particular advice about it.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's just-- it's nice-- it's
always affirming for me to hear

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.371 align:middle line:84%
stories like that to reinforce
the idea that there are many,

00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:90%
many parts.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.803 align:middle line:84%
And I found that very
beautiful what you were saying

00:35:43.803 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
about farming and your
connection to nature and stuff

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and just realizing it's
not all about these

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:84%
like heightened psychedelic
moments of-- there

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:90%
are epiphanies in our work life.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
There are epiphanies in
our connection to nature.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
just all different.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Different people
have different paths.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.129 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:59.129 --> 00:36:01.284 align:middle line:84%
But I think Stuart's experience
really kind of mirrors some

00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff you were saying.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen him now really
go through major life changes

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:84%
by following a path of
working with these different

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.415 align:middle line:90%
shamanic lines and medicines.

00:36:10.415 --> 00:36:11.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you want
to talk about how

00:36:11.735 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:84%
your life has kind of shifted?
-Yeah, I mean, it's funny.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
What you said is
correct, you know?

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.081 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been meeting a
lot of people from my past

00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
recently, you know?

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there was a big
shift over the summer, just

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
a real world shift,
definitely in New York City,

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
with people that
I've run into that I

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:84%
haven't seen in a long time
and that I used to party with.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are just meditating

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and really having
the same experiences

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I have with the medicine.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.975 align:middle line:84%
So I agree-- I
agree 100% that, you

00:36:31.975 --> 00:36:33.910 align:middle line:84%
know, you resonate
with what you resonate.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:90%
You try few different things.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's a
strict Buddhist, you know,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:90%
and he does medicine.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't really
get it, you know?

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.445 align:middle line:84%
But he does strict
Buddhist practice,

00:36:43.445 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and he's totally on a path.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just about
finding something you resonate

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
with and then to ground
you through this kind

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
of like threshold moment
that we're going through

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:90%
of this transition, you know?

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Ross, what do you think?

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you feel like
still called or compelled

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:90%
by this particular idea?

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just happy to
be back in your own realm?

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:90%
What idea?

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Of like working with these
different shamanic traditions.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I love mushrooms
and stuff, you know?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.825 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted-- i definitely
was-- I ate as much as I could,

00:37:16.825 --> 00:37:17.563 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:37:17.563 --> 00:37:21.337 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:21.337 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And do you guys all think that
like psychedelics are kind of

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
making a resurgence
in the culture

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:84%
right now somehow in maybe a
more positive way than they

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
have for a number of decades?

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.185 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's
differently a legitimizing

00:37:32.185 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in a more responsible model
coming through that, say, there

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
were so many amazing steps in
the '60s taken and the '70s,

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
but it also left a
very bad taste in sort

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.820 align:middle line:90%
of mainstream society's mouth.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a lot of-- like
I was saying with my record,

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I was very cautious about
how would this be received,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and I actually found quite
a lot of mainstream media--

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:84%
even when I
anticipated, ohm this

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a hatchet
job, they were actually

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:90%
quite receptive to the ideas.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a really-- it
is a really interesting

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:90%
dynamic period we're in.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's
how you do them, too.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, uh, you know,
like to do these ceremonies

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and to work with people that
understand the traditions

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
of some of these
ceremonies, and, you know,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
you take with you.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting and you're
doing-- like if you're doing

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:84%
like grandfather
medicine, peyote,

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're purifying a fire,
and you're taking care of fire,

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and there's like
rules of how to deal

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're paying
homage to things,

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:84%
then you take that out
into your life with you.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.547 align:middle line:84%
I find myself not
really thinking about it

00:38:34.547 --> 00:38:36.990 align:middle line:84%
while I'm in these ceremonies,
but when I come out,

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.660 align:middle line:90%
like living that path.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So it like becomes a
practice, and it becomes-- it

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.450 align:middle line:90%
feeds into your everyday life.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's sort
of a big part of it.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think like just
taking psychedelics

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.514 align:middle line:84%
just to take
psychedelics is maybe

00:38:50.514 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:84%
a little bit risky,
because you can do

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.807 align:middle line:90%
down different portholes and--

00:38:52.807 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So is a part of what you've
been gaining from doing

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the more ceremonial
work is like learning

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:84%
how to sort of take care
and handle things properly?

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's about
living with compassion,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:84%
respect, accountability
for your actions,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:90%
intention, and forgiveness.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
works, you know?

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of the ways I used
to live, someone did me wrong,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I'd go get a bat, you know?

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like I
just-- I pray for them.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of amazing,
like even just

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.270 align:middle line:84%
hearing what you're
just saying now,

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:90%
he could be talking about AA.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean,
we are talking

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:84%
about a basic
spiritual truth of,

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.634 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
path looks like.

00:39:26.634 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
STUART BRAUNSTEIN:
And AA is a path, too.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting yourself
together and becoming an adult

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.271 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a responsible
member of our planet.

00:39:32.271 --> 00:39:33.669 align:middle line:84%
And then what?
No, just kidding.

00:39:33.669 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And your community and
just doing you best.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.107 align:middle line:84%
You know, the funny
thing is, I tried AA,

00:39:37.107 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
resonate with it.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I actually did not get into
medicine to give up drugs.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to trick it, to
be honest, in the beginning.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
I was trying both ends of it.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's
this grandmother

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.471 align:middle line:84%
medicine, the ayahuasca
medicine, is like grandmother.

00:39:49.471 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Because she's like, eat your
broccoli, ear your broccoli.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise I'm gonna
pester you, you know?

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, it shows
you the enlightenment

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and then takes it away and
beats you up until you change.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The grandfather is like he gives
you a cigar-- it's the peyote--

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.701 align:middle line:84%
and then teaches you how to
live and tells you a story,

00:40:02.701 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So I've gotten like to
understand these medicines

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and how to use them and then
to, you know, actually do them.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It makes you live properly.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.185 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about a
psychedelic experience.

00:40:13.185 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's about how you live
your life, essentially.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of like
the sort of tradition

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.300 align:middle line:84%
you've been working with, which
I think you described it almost

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
like a mystery school,
like what are some

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
of the more like subtle
lessons that have been

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:90%
unfolding for you over time?

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The biggest lesson has
been about the vigilance

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.900 align:middle line:84%
with which I should
attend to my own mind,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning just
question everything.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Like we tend to-- I can
only speak for myself,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.150 align:middle line:84%
but I tended to have a very
black-and-white idea about when

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of acting egoically
and when I was acting

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
in a pure manner and
just realizing like,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:84%
it is way more
complicated than that.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:84%
There are-- some of the
purest intentions are sort of

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.630 align:middle line:90%
contaminated with selfishness.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we are really
talking about how to serve

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and how to not just
think about ourselves,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:84%
it is incredibly
subtle, you know.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.100 align:middle line:90%
The ego is cunning baffling.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's very subtle,
the ways that it

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
infects our ability to serve
and think in a bigger picture.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's just been about
that, about vigilance,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
about realizing like, wow,
how much attention to detail

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
can I give in the
integrity of my actions

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.302 align:middle line:90%
and my thoughts and my words?

00:41:27.302 --> 00:41:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us any
like kind of examples,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
like a practical example?
-Yeah, I can.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
A practical example was
actually to do with this album,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that at the same time
this album came out,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I was a mentor on that show
"The Voice" in Australia.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.749 align:middle line:84%
And, um--
-What's that show?

00:41:42.749 --> 00:41:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a reality singing show.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
They have one here
with, you know,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.951 align:middle line:84%
Adam Levine and Christina
Aguilera, big thing.

00:41:47.951 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I got off into
do it in Australia.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is
great, because I've

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:84%
made this album that is not
going to get on the radio.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a great opportunity
for me to get my music across

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.500 align:middle line:84%
or my face or
whatever makes people

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:90%
think about buying your record.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:90%
So I did this thing.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.477 align:middle line:84%
And I started to do
a lot of interviews

00:42:03.477 --> 00:42:04.610 align:middle line:84%
around this, because
it was a very

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.790 align:middle line:84%
mainstream-- a very mainstream
event, you know, a media event.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I caught myself
doing was kind of thumbing

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
my nose at the institution that
gave me the job on "The Voice"

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and being like-- like saying
things in interviews that

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:90%
were very bratty, like, see?

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.881 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like Rupert
Murdoch publicizing ayahuasca,

00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.746 align:middle line:84%
Because he was--
because, you know,

00:42:27.746 --> 00:42:30.240 align:middle line:84%
inadvertently it was giving
my album a lot of publicity.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I came away with quite
a sick feeling from some

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of this press I was doing.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
if I'm actually

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to serve the
message of the medicine

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that I've received,
it's not about appearing

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:84%
superior or appearing
smarter than the mainstream.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.505 align:middle line:84%
And I'd fallen back into
a very old archetypal

00:42:47.505 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and an old paradigm of
the punk rock thing of,

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.030 align:middle line:84%
hey, let me show
you how smart I am,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm more cynical and
smarter than the mainstream.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And just realized I need
to grow up past that.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been given this very
mainstream opportunity.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I should honor that and not
rock the boat unnecessarily.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I should hold this work and
this music, this sacred music,

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.385 align:middle line:84%
with complete
integrity and care.

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, don't insult the muggles.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:09.806 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.806 --> 00:43:10.810 align:middle line:90%
But you know what I'm saying.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the
end, I was going

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to shoot myself in the foot
and lose the whole thing.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of just-- I
don't know if that illustrated

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:21.030 align:middle line:84%
the point, but the point is
that like to really analyze

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.470 align:middle line:84%
my actions and my
motivations and not just

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
fall into old
patterns and behaviors

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that felt comfortable.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna ask you
two guys-- so the films

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that you did, "Don Peyote"
and "Sick Birds Die Easy"

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.470 align:middle line:84%
are kind of similar kind of
a format, I guess in a way,

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
sort of somewhere in
between documentary--

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.164 align:middle line:90%
I guess the term is mumblecore.

00:43:41.164 --> 00:43:42.030 align:middle line:90%
ROSS BROCKLEY: Oh, really?

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Never heard that one.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
You wanna explain what that is
and see if that's basically--

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.160 align:middle line:84%
STUART BRAUNSTEIN: Yeah,
well, mumblecore is basically

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:84%
you write out scenes,
and, you know,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.700 align:middle line:84%
you give the actors the
scenes, and you shoot it

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.220 align:middle line:84%
until you get a
good scene out of it

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and let them just
improv dialogue.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that kind of what you
guys were doing on your set?

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.980 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't much script at all.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.924 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:03.924 --> 00:44:05.680 align:middle line:10%
We were like walking
through the jungle,

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.540 align:middle line:10%
and, uh, the other character
Sam and I created this sort

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:10%
of animosity with each
other that we were

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:10%
stealing each other's drugs.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.640 align:middle line:90%
And so we hated each other.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And we would-- so
a lot of the movie

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.490 align:middle line:84%
is us just kind of
almost fighting.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So the director, Nik
Fackler, was kind of

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.020 align:middle line:84%
just open to what
kind happened and what

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:90%
dynamics kind of emerged?

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:35.850 align:middle line:84%
He would just tell us where
to go and maybe tell which--

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
somebody to break down
or-- it's, um, yeah,

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.771 align:middle line:84%
very loose, very mumblecore.
-Nice.

00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:45.184 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:45.184 --> 00:44:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was gonna ask
you guys-- you've

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
been doing a lot of this
ceremonial work over time,

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:90%
like each of you.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:84%
What's like the most
extraordinary single experience

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.295 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever
had in a ceremony?

00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.075 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know what's
really funny for me right now?

00:44:59.075 --> 00:45:00.735 align:middle line:90%
It's sweat lodges.

00:45:00.735 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:84%
-No, I said single experience.
-Single?

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.246 align:middle line:84%
You mean like an
actual experience?

00:45:03.246 --> 00:45:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:05.847 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean like
sitting in the seat of God

00:45:05.847 --> 00:45:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and moving energies in the
middle of the jungle, something

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.310 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, something
like that, yeah?

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well, that's it.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:11.576 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went down to Peru
and-- you know, the funny thing

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a lot
of different shamans

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that have darker energy
and lighter energy,

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.247 align:middle line:84%
but I was pretty much
open to anything.

00:45:22.247 --> 00:45:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
going down to Peru,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I knew this guy had a
little bit of a darker side.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was this
shaman who later

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.340 align:middle line:90%
got implicated in a death.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.340 align:middle line:90%
STUART BRAUNSTEIN: In a death.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Mancoluto.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that actually--
at Chimbre.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.584 align:middle line:84%
Which was a shame, because the
guy Rob who built that place--

00:45:34.584 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, just to give
people the backstory,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:84%
we had a friend who
was a Wall Street guy,

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and he found this shaman in Peru
and became very enamored of him

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.565 align:middle line:84%
and felt that was like
the one great shaman.

00:45:43.565 --> 00:45:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So he invested in this
guy, building kind

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of like an empire with a sort of
temple structure in the middle.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it turned out that
the guy was kind of a dark--

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.080 align:middle line:90%
STUART BRAUNSTEIN: Sorcerer.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Sorcerer.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up that somebody,
a young guy from the US

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
was down there doing
a ceremony and somehow

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.820 align:middle line:90%
died during the ceremony.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know why,
because instead of immediately

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.170 align:middle line:84%
go into the police or
whatever, they actually

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:84%
tried to destroy the body, which
led to a lot of-- which I think

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.996 align:middle line:84%
Mancoluto was in
prison for a while,

00:46:12.996 --> 00:46:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
kind of fell apart.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually been one of
the few cases that's really

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:24.627 align:middle line:84%
sort of cast a kind of negative
kind of spell over ayahuasca,

00:46:24.627 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
which has generally--
there hasn't

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:84%
really been any kind
of negative health

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.170 align:middle line:90%
implications or anything.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems
like ayahuasca's kind

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.125 align:middle line:84%
of like weathered that
storm, but Stuart went down

00:46:33.125 --> 00:46:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and worked with
that shaman a year

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:35.980 align:middle line:90%
or two before that happened.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.455 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew there was
something up with the guy.

00:46:38.455 --> 00:46:39.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm a New Yorker.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.645 align:middle line:84%
I can tell when someone's
kind of, you know, shady.

00:46:41.645 --> 00:46:43.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, he wasn't even
drinking his own medicine.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I just don't like drink with
someone who's not drinking

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:90%
what they're serving me, but--

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And instead of staying up
all right with everybody,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.290 align:middle line:84%
he would send people into
the jungle by themselves.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.790 align:middle line:84%
In the jungle by
themselves, which I thought

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.180 align:middle line:90%
was kind of cool, actually.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But, um, you know--

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I kind of-- what
happened was is it was

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.090 align:middle line:90%
like four or five ceremonies.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So I drank ayahuasca the
first night, and whenever.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I saw the visuals.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I went down there because I
wanted like some sort of-- I

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.220 align:middle line:84%
wanted to-- you
know, I'm very like,

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
ah, like I think everything's
bullshit, you know?

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.034 align:middle line:90%
That's been mainly my thing.

00:47:14.034 --> 00:47:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been an atheist
my whole life.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.014 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even believe in God.
So I went down.

00:47:17.014 --> 00:47:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I've
got to see this.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what this--
I want to be shown this,

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.495 align:middle line:84%
a reality here that
I can understand,

00:47:23.495 --> 00:47:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that I can believe in this.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I was just
getting into it.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the first time, I saw
the cool like very obvious

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.650 align:middle line:90%
stuff, pyramids and dragons.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm like, all
right, that's hallucination.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Then I did San Pedro.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And that was great.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.840 align:middle line:84%
That's like a shot of adrenaline
in the neck, you know?

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like you turn into a wolf.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing. you
know, get your mojo back.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the next night, he
wanted to serve me San Pedro

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.980 align:middle line:90%
again, but I wanted ayahuasca.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So I told him no, and
everyone was like,

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:90%
you said no to this guy?

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:90%
You're not supposed to.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no, I want that.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I know what I want, you know?

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:90%
So he sit me back.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, OK, and then
passes me by when

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:90%
he was serving the medicine.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so he came back to
me, gave me the medicine,

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I go into the tent.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just sitting there.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting and waiting.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's gonna happen?

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.030 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden-- boom--
my chest opens up.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:10.395 align:middle line:90%
Blood starts squirting out.

00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:12.801 align:middle line:84%
A rattle comes out of
my neck, starts shaking.

00:48:12.801 --> 00:48:14.716 align:middle line:84%
I vibrate.
-In a vision, not in reality.

00:48:14.716 --> 00:48:15.415 align:middle line:90%
In a vision, yeah.

00:48:15.415 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But I vibrate into
a billion pieces

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and then snap back
together again.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
sound in the jungle,

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:90%
just like little like boops.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I walk outside.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I sit on the deck
out of the tent.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And literally I'm sitting
there pushing the jungle,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's like waving.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was like no
sounds, no bugs, no air.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.920 align:middle line:90%
And you know, the jungle's loud.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.632 align:middle line:84%
So that was a pretty
big indication to me

00:48:41.632 --> 00:48:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that this was
something different,

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, and something I
needed to experience more of.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So that was definitely the
beginning of my journey.

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Where I am now with it is a
whole other another story.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a practice now.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's go back.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to hear his most
extraordinary single incident.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the one
that comes to mind

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is very simple in that I had one
ceremony that I just struggled

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the whole-- you know, it
was a matter of hours,

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.110 align:middle line:84%
but it felt like
lifetimes, just struggle,

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.140 align:middle line:90%
deep, deep, painful struggle.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And when it was
finally relieved,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:84%
it was actually during
Occupy Wall Street.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd been down, and I
saw-- it had sort of gone

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.520 align:middle line:84%
against my expectations in
that I thought it was all

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:84%
like young, sort of pseudo
anarchists and stuff,

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:84%
but there were
nurses and teachers.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this overwhelming
sense of compassion

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.290 align:middle line:84%
for all-- everybody's
struggle, how

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.610 align:middle line:84%
everyone I encounter and
everyone I see is struggling.

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still-- I feel
emotional remembering it,

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:84%
because it was the first
time I can honestly

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.870 align:middle line:84%
say I felt real compassion
and that I said,

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.890 align:middle line:84%
wow, that struggle I just
felt, we're all doing that.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I've
tried to carry with me

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and just tried to
stay in touch with.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.500 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Hm.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.891 align:middle line:84%
-And then I saw a dragon.
-[LAUGHS]

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:56.456 align:middle line:84%
-[INAUDIBLE]
-What's that?

00:49:56.456 --> 00:49:57.930 align:middle line:90%
You don't wanna hear mine.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:90%
No, what' yours?

00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:59.695 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't have one.

00:49:59.695 --> 00:50:01.146 align:middle line:90%
That sounds awesome.

00:50:01.146 --> 00:50:02.341 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:02.341 --> 00:50:03.740 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: We're
gonna have to send

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.850 align:middle line:90%
you back to shaman school.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:90%
ROSS BROCKLEY: That's right.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Remedial classes.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.260 align:middle line:84%
What I realize now
is that sweat lodges

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.520 align:middle line:90%
are really an amazing thing.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.955 align:middle line:84%
That's more what I
believe in these days.

00:50:12.955 --> 00:50:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
go to these sweat

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:84%
lodges, and you do a prayer
in there, and you come out.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.005 align:middle line:84%
You're cleaned, and it's
not like a big processing

00:50:19.005 --> 00:50:21.780 align:middle line:84%
thing and something that you
can balance yourself with,

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you guys think the
impact of this type of work

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:26.364 align:middle line:90%
is going to be culturally?

00:50:26.364 --> 00:50:28.230 align:middle line:84%
We're already seeing it kind
of more and more permeating

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the culture in all
these different forms

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and different major figures.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are there like
kind of cultural figures

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that you wish would
have these experiences

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.370 align:middle line:90%
or political figures?

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And where do you think we'll
be with it in like 5, 10 years?

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's tough,
because it's a lot of work.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, really,
you get stuff out of this

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:90%
if you do the work.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And just to do one experience
with this medicine or a couple

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.780 align:middle line:84%
experiences and not
really understand what it

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and unless you're trying
to connect to something,

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a longer process.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's the silver
bullet, for sure, you know?

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that, um,
it's a long way to go.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.035 align:middle line:84%
I think it worked for me,
so if it worked for me,

00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's worked
for many other people.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It got me into a nice place.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you wish that friends
that you used to hang out with

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:90%
would have these experiences?

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think they're
not really ready for them

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:84%
at this point?
-You know, it's funny.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.694 align:middle line:84%
Three years ago or four
years ago when I started,

00:51:19.694 --> 00:51:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I was telling people, and
people thought I was crazy.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm running into people all
the time saying, I tried it.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.040 align:middle line:90%
You were right.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.862 align:middle line:84%
So it is really-- it's
permeating a lot of cultures.

00:51:26.862 --> 00:51:27.895 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just the medicine.

00:51:27.895 --> 00:51:30.311 align:middle line:84%
It's also meditation and
yoga and eating well.

00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:31.560 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Juicing.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone
I know now seems

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:90%
to be on a path like that.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing. i used to
know people that were

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.450 align:middle line:90%
just drinking and doing drugs.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Now I know all people that are
drinking cold-pressed juices

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:10%
and eating vegan food, you know?

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And having a good time with it.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You used to scoff at me
when I didn't eat some kind

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.527 align:middle line:84%
of throbbing piece of meat.
-I know.

00:51:46.527 --> 00:51:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't
wanna eat that food!

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead.
So go ahead.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.989 align:middle line:10%
What do you--

00:51:48.989 --> 00:51:51.600 align:middle line:10%
I just think-- I obviously
don't know what the future

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.840 align:middle line:10%
holds, but I think one
of the great lessons

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.330 align:middle line:10%
we can take from
Buddhism and Hinduism

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.950 align:middle line:10%
and Eastern thought
is the lesson of karma

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.780 align:middle line:10%
and that we are creating
the future today.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.520 align:middle line:10%
And it just-- the more of
us that, like you said,

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.810 align:middle line:10%
whether it's through medicine or
through other conscious paths,

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:10%
choose to start taking baby
steps of more integrity

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.050 align:middle line:10%
and more compassion
towards each other,

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.720 align:middle line:10%
we are creating a better future.

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I just choose to
stay optimistic about

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that more people will
be attracted to that.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:22.855 align:middle line:84%
I see that happening
in a big way, actually.

00:52:22.855 --> 00:52:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it really is happening.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:28.121 align:middle line:84%
It's probably hard to
notice, but it's happening.

00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, listen, thank you guys
so much for joining us today

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.940 align:middle line:84%
on "Mind Shift" or "Brain
Drain" or "Time Drift"

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.100 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the heck it is.
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to have you
back in the future.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, man.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Ben, great to see you, Stuart.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Ross, thanks for your
contributions there.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you very much.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.181 align:middle line:84%
And thank you all so much
for being with us today.

00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much.
