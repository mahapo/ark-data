00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Mind Shifts."
"Mind Shift" is unique

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.680 align:middle line:10%
talk show because we
take the time to explore

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:10%
important ideas,
visions, and viewpoints

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:10%
that the mainstream often
suppresses or marginalizes.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
We are interested
in many aspects

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:90%
of the world and our future.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:84%
These include the development
of science and new technologies,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
love and relationships,
our planetary ecology,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.334 align:middle line:84%
and the future of
spirituality and religion.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Hi, folks.
Welcome back to "Mind Shift."

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:10%
Right now, I'm here with
Howard Bloom and Richard

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:10%
Smalley, two authors.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I mean, the
fun of the show for me

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
is that potentially we can
dive into pertinent and unusual

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
issues that usually don't get
a chance to really hear fully

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%
fleshed out and discussed.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And with Howard and
Richard, we have

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:90%
kind of different perspectives.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Howard is a scientific
materialist, self-proclaimed

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:90%
stone cold atheist.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Richard is a scholar
of esoteric traditions

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and entered the
Theosophical Society.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I would start
out with asking you guys,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:90%
is there a god?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what's he doing?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my humble
opinion-- and this

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
is my religion we're
talking about right now.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
a system of faith.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
My system of faith says
there absolutely is not--

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:90%
is not a god, period.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:10%
However if there
were a god, we're it.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:10%
If were-- if there
were a god, it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:10%
our job to do his or her work.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have two sons
who are three and four

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and they asked me
recently what God was.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And since I was just sitting
there in the living room,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I had to come up with something.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:10%
So I said, God is where
everything comes from.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:10%
God is the source of everything.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And they seem to accept that.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Or at least they didn't
question it too much.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.187 align:middle line:84%
And reflecting on
it, I didn't really

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
think I was going to
come up with a much

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:90%
better answer than that.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, it is that this
source is kind of out of which

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
we all emerge, including
I-- that is to say,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that in me which says I. You're
never going to see-- this

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I is not God, so to speak.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's where you
connect with God.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So you're never going
to see it because it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
always what's doing the seeing.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a little-- a
difficult-- little

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
difficult to get your mind
around, but not that difficult.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have a book,
the book we talked,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
about how consciousness
creates the material world.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
You can you explain that
concept a little bit

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and see how Howard
resonates with it?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the book is
actually called

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
"The Dice Game of
Shiva-- How Consciousness

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Creates the Universe."

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I do in it, which I
think is interesting at least,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is that I try to give a
definition of consciousness

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:90%
that's not circular.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, you can't just
say consciousness is awareness

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:90%
is perception is consciousness.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that-- that's
just not a definition.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So the way I define
consciousness,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it has
the merit of being

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
non-circular in any rate,
is it's the capacity

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to relate self and other.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Without a sense
of self and other,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:90%
there's no consciousness.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Deep sleep is an
interesting example.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And we could go into that.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But just to be
simple, in deep sleep,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
there's no sense
of self and other.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So we normally say
there's no consciousness.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, although according to
the Hindu tradition, isn't deep

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
sleep consciousness
considered a very deep

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness
if you can maintain

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:90%
awareness at that level?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's-- but that's why I
said I didn't want to make it--

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I tried to keep it
simple, but you're right.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is a level of
consciousness-- even apart

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:84%
from that, there is a level of
consciousness that's operating

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
while you're asleep,
you know, which is

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of the body.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what-- what is the most
universally prescribed remedy

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:90%
for all illnesses?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, sleep.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, sleep
in some way allows

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the body to fight out
this-- fight off the other

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:90%
of these pathogens.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So there is a sense
of self and other.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just not what we think
of as waking consciousness.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And the corollary to that is
that our waking consciousness

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is just a narrow bandwidth
on a very enormous spectrum

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of this capacity to
perceive and respond,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be
present not only in very

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
primitive, single
celled organisms,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:90%
but in molecules and atoms.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in some way, a
sodium atom doesn't possess

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
introspective consciousness
like a, you know,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
a Woody Allen
character or something.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But it has the capacity
to, in some way or another,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
recognize a chlorine atom and
respond to it in some sort

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of way under certain
circumstances that makes

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
a salt. So if you
look at it that way,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
this is all kind of
an enormous continuum.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I guess what I
would say is God is sort

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
of what that arises out of.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a personal
god in the sense that--

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
or a creator god in the sense
that conventional religion

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:90%
views it.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
something to it.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, from a scientific
point of view,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
you're posing some very
important questions

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:90%
that science is not confronting.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And question number
one, let's convert

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
your first definition of God
to your kids into a question.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
How does the cosmos come to be?

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
If there is a nothing,
how does that nothing

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
become the singularity, that
infinitesimal pinprick smaller

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
than a pinprick,
that starts things

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
off-- the singularity at the
beginning of the Big Bang?

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
How does the Big Bang
produce time and space?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
How does time and space
rushing at super speed--

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:90%
what is speed to begin with?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
How does a mere rush
of time and space

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
suddenly precipitate
like a storm

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
cloud precipitating in
raindrops, in quarks,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:90%
the very first things?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:90%
What are things to begin with?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Why are there only 16
different kinds of things?

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
If this is a cosmos of 16
monkeys and six typewriters

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and it operates on the basis
of probability and statistics,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
then there should be,
if there are gazillions

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
of different things
precipitating

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
in that first instant,
why aren't there

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
gazillions of different
kinds of things?

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.695 align:middle line:84%
Why are there only 16
different kinds of quarks?

00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean we have
to throw out the six

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:90%
monkeys of the six typewriters?

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean we have to throw
out the mathematics with which

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
we've been trying to comprehend
the cosmos-- probability

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and statistics?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And then let's jump to
a whole other question.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Not just how do new
things come to be

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and why did they come
to be in the forms

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that they are in--
13.7 billion years

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
into the history
of the cosmos, how

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
do we end up with this weird
stuff called consciousness?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
What the hell is
it and what is it

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of
that universe that

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
started with the Big Bang,
time, space, whoosh and things--

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Wh-- wh--

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
What it is-- what--
is it implicit--

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:84%
what is it that makes it
possible for that universe,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
13 billion years more
than that down the line,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%
to produce consciousness?

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
What the hell is
consciousness anyway?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:90%
These are huge.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
What would-- what
would-- what would

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:90%
be kind of your definition?

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.355 align:middle line:84%
Because he offered one--
-Of consciousness?

00:07:58.355 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have to
distinguish between two

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of science.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
One type of science is
observational science.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We look at the things
around us and we

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:90%
try to make sense of them.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:90%
The second is inductive science.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
We take a set of
propositions, a set of axioms,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the way we built the
geometric system,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and we pull things from them--
logical things from them.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no way in
hell we're going

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
to get hold of consciousness
through the inductive system.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
by going from a
handful of principles.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's Aristotle in
proposing that we start

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:84%
with a handful of principals
and then inductively derive

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
things from there who told us--
start your scientific arguments

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:90%
with your definitions.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to observational
science, he's wrong.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't start with
your definitions.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Arrive at your definitions
at the end of a long process

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:90%
of observation.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
We have not observed enough
about consciousness in 2013.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We have not come up
with enough concepts

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
with which to grasp
what consciousness

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is in 2013 to even begin
to define consciousness.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is describe
what we know of it

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and try to make sense of it
with things like neurobiology,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
pattern recognition,
Gestalt psychology,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:90%
the tools of our time.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do
you think of that?

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot to it
respond to in it, obviously.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
One tack I'll take is there's
a Harvard scholar named

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:84%
E.J. Michael Witzel,
who came out with a book

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
recently on the world's
mythologies, the origins

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:90%
of the world's mythologies.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And his argument, which is very
intricate, which I'll summarize

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
very briefly, is that
they all come back

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
from the same source,
which is Africa, when

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
humanity all lived in Africa.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But the mythologies of North and
South America and Eurasia all

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
have a very, very
similar story to them.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is a story of the
origin of the gods, the origin

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos the origin of the
human race, the ages of man,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
complete with last
judgment or Gotterdammerung

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:84%
He says this-- he calls
it the Lorasian mythos,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not going to
explain at the moment.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But he says it arose
between 20,000 and 40,000 BC

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
by comparative mythology.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, he has no trouble
putting the Judeo Christian

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:90%
cosmological view into that.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And it fits very
nicely in it where

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.945 align:middle line:84%
you have the God creating the
world and the last judgment

00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's a
little curious about it,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't do
this-- and I suspect

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that as a conventional
scholar, he can't-- is like,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
What about our
scientistic picture

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
of the history of the universe?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this the same Lorasian
mythos just with the terms

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
changed and, rather than gods
who may be well or ill disposed

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
toward us, simply
impersonal forces?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And then this leads to another
question, which is, hey, well,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that's looks a lot
like a human lifetime,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, projected
on a universal scale.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we're just projecting
our own human ingestion

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
from a seed right down to
demise onto a cosmos again.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask well, if
that's so, if we can only

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
see the universe as-- in
purely anthropomorphic terms

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
regardless of our worldview,
can we ever see, you know,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:90%
anything out there?

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Are we always just limited
to seeing the world

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:90%
as a human would see the world?

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a big
argument in my new book,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
in "The God Problem,"
about anthropomorphism

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:90%
versus anthropocentrism.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And in science, we're
often criticized

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
for being anthropomorphic.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
We're criticized for
seeing human patterns

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the universe through
those patterns, which means,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:84%
are we really
seeing the universe?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And the book makes the
case, "The God Problem"

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
makes the case,
that in fact this

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is an anthropocentric
point of view.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It takes it for granted that
things like will and death

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
are unique to humans.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But what if they are
not unique to humans?

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
When you've got that
cosmos we talked

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
about at the very beginning
with the Big Bang,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:84%
there's a big woomph
to that universe.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a big rush
forward to that universe.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a drive and an impulse
to that universe that takes it

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
through the steps of Big Bang,
time and space, a huge rush,

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the precipitation
of the first quarks,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the precipitation of
atoms, the precipitation

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
of stars and galaxies.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
There is something going
on there that is somehow

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
feels like it's goal directed.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Is all goal directedness
really only in us?

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Or is it in us because we
inherited it from our first

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
ancestors-- that time
and space, that big bang,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
in those first quarks?

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a question that's
not raised in science.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be-- the idea
that death, for example,

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
is unique to us and so
we imagine it elsewhere.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Hasn't anybody heard of the
evolution of the first stars?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The first stars,
the really big ones,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
only lasted a few million years.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
They carried within them the
seeds of their own destruction.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And what did they do after
those first few million years?

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:90%
They died.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:10%
How could we be so arrogant
as to imagine that death is

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:10%
an experience unique
to us when it's

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.782 align:middle line:10%
been going on in this
cosmos for 13 billion years?

00:13:58.782 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I have another question
about the whole

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
of scientistic perspective.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I just want to point
out that your perspective

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
actually sounds almost more
religious than his in a sense.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you're-- you're
beginning to propose that there

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
are these kind of personality
traits to the-- to the cosmos

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, one thing I'm curious
about with the scientific

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
perspective, which is science
has been very, very preoccupied

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:10%
with finding out how
consciousness arises

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:10%
from the brain, now
it hasn't really

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:10%
found out how to do that yet.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it seems to be
agreed that the structures

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and the nervous
system structure consciousness

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and our experience of reality
in certain sort of way.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So is there any
possible way in which

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:84%
we are ever going to, you know,
see the universe as it is?

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's always going to be
limited through this brain.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And why-- see,
the thing about it

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes science
talks in a very consciousness

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is limited by the
brain and all that.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are times when
it talks in terms of almost

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:90%
like a naive realism.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive is
really out there.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really like
objective reality.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And those two
points of view often

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:90%
seem to contradict each other.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, you bring up
a really, really,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
really good point
about are we ever going

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to understand
consciousness simply

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:90%
by understanding the brain.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle laid out a program
in 2300-- 2300 years ago,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:90%
roughly 300, 315 BC.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said if you reduce
things to their elements,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and then use a really
weird metaphor.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
He have just said metaphor
is illegal in science.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But he used a really
weird metaphor.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you find the laws
of those elements-- laws?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
things Hamurabi

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:90%
carved-- had carved in stone?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Those things that
dictate human behavior?

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't he realize
this is a metaphor

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and a very strange one
for elements of reality,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%
whatever reality is?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you find the
laws of these elements,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:84%
you will know how
everything works.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately, he was--
and by the way, those-- that's

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
where we get the
phrase elementary laws,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
from two pages in one
book by Aristotle.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And we've been following
that program ever since.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called reductionism,
that program.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Two days ago on C-SPAN,
a physicist from NYU

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was trying to discuss all the
things that we obviously know

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:90%
about how the cosmos works.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's very obvious
that if we understand the laws

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that govern the atoms and the
molecules in a basketball,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
we'll understand how
a basketball works.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
but of course, when

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
we're bouncing a basketball,
it's a whole different set

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:90%
of laws that we appeal to.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Then he somehow made
it look as if that's

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because we understand
the basic laws of how

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:90%
the atoms and molecules work.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
No, he had just said that
understanding the basic laws

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
of how the atoms
and molecules work

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
gets us nowhere in understanding
how to bounce the basketball.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
larger scale realities

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that come forth from
these smaller scale things

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
describe by breaking

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
things down to their
elements and finding

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
the laws of the elements.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's so used
to current science

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
think-- science as a religion,
science as a catechism--

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't recognize
the contradiction

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in what he had just said.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
There are larger
scale realities.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we call them
emergent properties

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:90%
for want of a better word.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%
They are friggin amazing.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Stars, galaxies, consciousness--
they did not come logically

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:90%
from the smaller units.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But they do come from somewhere.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And finding things that
come from somewhere

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate job of science.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate goal of
science is to have

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
an aspiration
toward omniscience,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to have an aspiration
to know everything.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:84%
If there is no God, it is our
job to do his work, or hers.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And that means it
is our obligation

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to recognize questions when
they rise up before our eyes.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
The scientist on C-SPAN was
failing to be a scientist when

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
he failed to recognize
the contradiction

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in what he had just
said because he failed

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the question.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And having not recognized
it, he failed to pursue it.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
There are large scale
realities of some kind

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond the elements of
which they are made.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job in science
to go out and find them.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
We disagree on only one small
or seemingly small point.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, how can I be
so [INAUDIBLE] here?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The conversation has
gone a lot of ways.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.381 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I would say it's our
duty to find the truth.

00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.521 align:middle line:84%
You know, if only because it
seems like an interesting thing

00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to do.
-Yes.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I would-- the only
thing I would say

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is science is one
of those avenues.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I would not say
science is the avenue.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.426 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific method
is legitimate in, you know,

00:19:17.426 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We know, for example, that the
boundaries of our perceptions

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:90%
are limited, right?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
span of the spectrum

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:90%
that we can see with our eyes.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
There's another wider
spectrum that we can perceive

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
with instruments
that we've used,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to
expand our vision.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We have no reason to believe
that these limits here

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
or our instruments are the
limits of the totality.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And it may well be that science
will extend them further.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you sort of come to
the question as like, well--

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm certainly not the
first person to say this.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But science then starts
to look like, you know,

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
metaphysics and occultism
and all that kind of things.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.301 align:middle line:84%
Well, well, what would you say
are some of the other avenues?

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
-Oh--
-Can I answer that?

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in
"The God Problem."

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.574 align:middle line:90%
Move your head.

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, let him-- let him
give it a shot and see what--

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly mystical
cognitive experience,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
introspection social
interaction, art, music,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
literature, all of these
things are in a sense avenues

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
to knowledge that are, you
know, not scientific as such.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I would say religion also.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Religion offers certain
insights that science doesn't.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So I would just say that
the method of inquiry

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
has to encompass
everything we can think of.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see a very
methodical statement

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of that in "The God Problem."

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And "The God Problem" says
that we humans operate

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
with symbolic systems, symbolic
systems based on what Aristotle

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
outlawed as anti-scientific--
metaphor, the very thing he

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
was using when he
talked about laws

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
applying to elements of things.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:90%
He was using metaphor.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have a set of
metaphorical tools,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:90%
a set of metaphorical systems.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're exactly
what you talked about.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.961 align:middle line:84%
They consist of religion, art,
human interaction, not just

00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
He also was saying that
perhaps science is-- is trapped

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
in those metaphorical
systems just as much

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:90%
as these other disciplines.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I won't let science
be trapped in those things.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely won't.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Because I was born into science.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Science saved my life.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Science is my religion.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's my job to make sure
science lives up to what

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
science has to be, even
though I'm a pipsqueak

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and may never be heard.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that it
is our obligation,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
if we can grasp things
only with mysticism,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:90%
grasp them, for God's sakes.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Bring them into the realm
of symbolic expression,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:84%
then toss them over to
the scientific brain

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to ponder and to figure out.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
If poetry is the only
way of grabbing them,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
grab them, for God's sakes.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It may be that
there are other forms

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
of technique that are
scientific ultimately in nature.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.041 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't really
defined their parameters yet.

00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance, we were
talking before-- both of us

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
touched on in our previous
discussions paranormal

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%
or psychic experience.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about-- and you mentioned,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
as I've had, certain
experiences that seem to confer

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
psychic experience

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and even the
ability of our minds

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to interact and affect and
transform physical reality

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
in ways that to-- to
an objective scientific

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
perspective or whatever
objective means

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.055 align:middle line:90%
would seem totally impossible.

00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And-- and your-- your attitude
was to kind of reject that

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
almost summarily and say,
as far as you're concerned,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:90%
that's very unlikely.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But once upon a, time sometime
between about 1810 and 1830,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
one of the British scientists
did something weird.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
He had a horseshoe--
magnetism had

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
been something that
had been preoccupying

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:90%
science since 1650.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:10%
He had a magnet on his desk.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
He put a piece of
paper on the magnet.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, a bunch of iron filings
fell onto the piece of paper.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And whammo, he saw all of
these concentric rings of iron

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:90%
filings around the magnet.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There was clearly something
there that had been

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
invisible-- invisible to
220 years of scientists

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that up to that point

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and that nobody in
science, including

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:84%
me, if I'd been around at the
time, would have believed in it

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
all.
And it was there.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
We call it magnetic force.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:90%
We take it for granted now.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole invisible
force we didn't see.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is entirely possible that
some time in the next 10 to 100

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:84%
years, somebody is going to
come up with the equivalent

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:84%
to another piece of paper and
another batch of iron filings.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And whammo, all of a sudden,
forces that are invisible to us

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that we don't talk about
in science that we've never

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:84%
perceived are going to
come whopping into reality

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and are going to
become a normal fact

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:90%
of every day scientific life.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But right now, as a
scientific thinker,

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to deal with the
things I know are there

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and the challenge of trying
to understand things in terms

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of them and the challenge
of trying to understand

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:84%
these large scale patterns like
consciousness, like a star,

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
like a galaxy, that
emerge in spite

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:84%
of the limits of the elementary
laws, the holistic patterns,

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:90%
the gestalt patterns.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:90%
What the hell are they?

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.301 align:middle line:84%
Where do they come from?
Why?

00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Those are the questions
I'm trying to pose

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and even find a vocabulary for.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, you certainly raise
a lot of interesting issues.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I think one thing
that, you know,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
always needs to be borne in
mind is a point that you made

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
in an earlier segment, which
is there is an enormous amount

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:90%
of groupthink among scientists.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And you used it in regard
to the global warming

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:90%
issue, which is fascinating.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be
surprised if there

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
was at least some very strong
element of truth in that.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly the case
in terms of parapsychology.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.512 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly the case
that they did that did

00:25:01.512 --> 00:25:02.345 align:middle line:90%
all of these experiments.

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, they used to
do card guessing games--

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.275 align:middle line:90%
the J.B. Rhine Duke experiment.

00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Right, and I used to
follow those week by week.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And, well?

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't do them
anymore because they

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:90%
ceased to be interesting.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:90%
They replicated the results.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
There is some small
element beyond chance.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%
So they don't do that anymore.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's as if none of this
ever happened and the idea is,

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
like, well, you know, the
scientistic materialists--

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not including
you among them,

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
at least for this
purpose, you know.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just-- ah, the--
the studies are flaws.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Ah, somehow, they're flawed.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're up against
a problem in science.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Science as a community.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And communities do a lot
of conformity enforcing,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
even though it is
antithetical to science,

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
absolutely against science,
to do conformity enforcing.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- you know, I'm
an outsider in this community

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
because I'm continually trying
to raise questions that it's

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%
not considered polite to raise.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, I know that if I
went far enough out into space

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to start bringing up the
JB Rhine stuff of my youth,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
all the psychological studies
of my youth, the stuff

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
at Princeton University that
indicated that you actually

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
could have an influence
on physical objects--

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
a small, statistically
measurable influence

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
on physical objects-- if I
were to bring that stuff up,

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that small amount of credibility
I need in order to raise

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
questions in the
scientific community

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:90%
would disappear immediately.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
these are things

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I just have to stay away from.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Even I who try to do
everything in my power

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to be courageous
and take chances

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
know that there's
only so far I can go.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But I would go there if I felt
it was going to be productive.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I'd rather go where
you go, with [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and with my own experiences
with peyote and LSD,

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
which admittedly I only
did twice in my life

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:90%
for each of those things.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But these things expanded
the realm of my consciousness

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and I know there is
a truth and a reality

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:84%
there that I can
bring back to science.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So I have to choose which
things to be outrageous about.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's-- I mean
that's very, very sobering.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Because of course,
to my knowledge,

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't have, like,
a job at a university

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that could be threatened by,
you know, something, like this.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Right, and if I had
a job at a university,

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I would be far more constrained.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
so incredibly lucky

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that I don't have a conventional
scientific position.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's--

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But then considering
all of that,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
why take such a negative stance
as what you did in your earlier

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
episode where you're kind of
like-- when I brought it up,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
you were kind of, like, pushing
it away with such force,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:84%
which is so much the
condescending attitude that you

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
get from most people who
are in the scientific

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:84%
world view about psychic
experience or paranormal--

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the
years-- remember,

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:84%
this was extremely
popular when I was a kid.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I did get into science
at the age of 10, which

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
means that I got in in 1953.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And that means that in
the first six or seven

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
years of my
immersion in science,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:90%
this was a very strong current.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I never found
anything useful in it.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Did I find anything
useful in peyote?

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Immediately-- immediately,
the doors of perception

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
started opening, to use
Aldous Huxley's phrase.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But-- but-- but useful is
different than true, no?

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I never found anything
that rang true in it.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, one day when I was 18
and had dropped out of school

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and was seeking Satori
Zen Buddhist enlightenment

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and people were dropping
out of their jobs

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and following me, I was alone in
a great big coal car on the way

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
from God knows
what-- what railroad

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
town in-- in
California to Nevada--

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:90%
a long trip and a painful one.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And coal cars have a--

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe-- maybe you're
next to be the next--

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
you're meant to
be the next world

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.670 align:middle line:84%
avatar or kalki but you've got
kind of distracted by science.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what happened.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The coal cars and
freight cars in general

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
do not have any
suspension system.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot sit.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to stand or you
would bounce like this.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Your ass would hit that
metal over and over again.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It would be horribly disruptive.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So you stand the whole way.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a coal
car, there's coal.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's sweeping from
the rear of the car up

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to the front
convection currents,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
then going up
above the car's rim

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and coming back at
65 miles an hour.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Your followers must have
been kind of pissed at you.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, so you're--
you're being-- your face

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:90%
is being sand blasted by coal.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And when-- when
the coal car stops,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
the way they get the
coal out of the car

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the entire floor is
six huge flaps with levers.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84%
The lever holds
the flap in place.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point
after three hours

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
standing in this coal car being
sandblasted, I had a feeling.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
move my knapsack

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and myself from the left front
flap to the right front flap.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes later, there
was an enormous clang.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And that flap I had been
standing up for 3 and 1/2 hours

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:90%
flapped open.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
If I'd still been standing
there, I'd be a hamburger

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
or I would have
been a hamburger.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I would have disappeared
a long time ago.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be here with you.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that a paranormal experience?

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I've had a number of them.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
that ring of truth.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It gives me the feeling that it
will provide a tool with which

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I can understand things.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And peyote did.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And LSD did, even though
I only did them twice.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, you
feel that something

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to be something
that you can use

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to pry a reality out of
the wall of a coal mine

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and turn into an
object of amazement.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they
don't impress you

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:90%
as being those kinds of tools.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have to pass on the
ones that don't feel like tools.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say if any
instincts or intuition

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
it would be considered useful,

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:90%
that would be one of them.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I-- I-- you know, it doesn't
get more useful than that.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know that.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, another thing I think
that-- that is worth mentioning

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is for the sake of analysis,
we divide the senses

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:90%
into these various categories.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:90%
This is, you know, sensory.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:90%
This is olfactory, so on, so on.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously not
very well distinguished.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, the sense of
taste and sense of smell

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:90%
are inexplicably linked, yeah.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
that what a lot of we

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
think of with intuition, kind
of gut feeling, you know,

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is-- is not necessarily all
that radically different

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:90%
from the other senses.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just one that we, you
know, for various reasons,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:84%
have-- have chosen not to
pay attention to or develop.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So there-- there's-- to
what extent you're feeling

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:84%
someone's eyes on
the back of your head

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of extension
of peripheral vision.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you did catch a glance.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I think there are two-- I
think there are at least two--

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that book that
[INAUDIBLE] did about man's

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:84%
possible future evolution
where he talked about how

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
our intuitive
faculties, our cognitive

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:84%
faculties that just are
so much faster than our--

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
than our rational
faculties, they're

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:84%
like in another
category altogether.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think
they're sufficiently

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.970 align:middle line:90%
different to make a difference.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to wrap up soon, but
go ahead and make your comment.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day-- OK, one
day, my friend Val Geiss

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.160 align:middle line:84%
who's a leading
expert on large animal

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
be-- one of the leading
experts on large animal

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:84%
behavior in the world was
doing what Val Geiss does.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Six months of the year, he puts
on a knapsack, gets a rifle,

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and goes up into the mountains
and follows the mountain

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.070 align:middle line:84%
sheep and lives like a mountain
sheep and lives off the land.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while, Val
would encounter a grizzly bear.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And Val loves it when he
encounters grizzly bears.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a
status hierarchy match.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
It's to see who's the
biggest guy on the block.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And the grizzly bear
stands up on his hind legs

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and makes a great
big show and says,

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm the biggest
guy on the block.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to terrify you.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And Val gets up on his
hind legs and says,

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm the biggest
guy on the block.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to terrify you.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's a showdown.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, it wasn't
a male grizzly bear

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Val ran against-- up against.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
He ran across a
female grizzly bear.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And he'd come too
close to her cubs.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
And she's not in this for show.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
She's in this to
protect her cubs.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So she took after
Val like a mad woman.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, Val had
an out of body experience.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And it felt to him as if his
consciousness was perching

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
on a tree watching
as he saw his body

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
scampering across the
landscape looking for a tree

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.990 align:middle line:84%
he could climb and then climbing
that tree until he got high

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:84%
enough that he could go
out on a branch confident

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that he was high above
the grizzly bears head

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and do a victory dance over her
head hanging from the branch.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, Val and I are
materialist scientists, right?

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
So what do we think about
out of body experiences?

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
We have to come up
with a materialist

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:90%
or a biological explanation.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And here's the explanation
we came up with.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to the difference
between intuition and reason.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
In the brain,
normally, things that

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
are coming in from
the outdoors--

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, sensory
experiences-- they

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:90%
come up to the limbic system.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they're pursed out to
the cortex to be figured out.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, once the cortex
figures them out,

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
it sends messages back to move
your arms, move your legs.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And the gap when the mind
is figuring things out

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is point 0.4 of a second--
4/10 of a second, a little bit

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.280 align:middle line:90%
less than half a second.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
Now, under normal
circumstances, you

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:84%
can afford that extra
half a second of time.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But when the grizzly bear is
really out to end your life

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and she's moving as fast as
she possibly can, you cannot

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:90%
afford that extra half second.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
The stuff we call intuition,
the nonverbal senses,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:90%
take over entirely.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And they park your
conscious self anywhere

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
you want to fantasize being.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Local tree?

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Cloud in the sky?

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.581 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely fine, just
get out of the way.

00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So the incoming stuff can
go up to the limbic system

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and go directly to the outcoming
stuff and not lose your life.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So there are at least two
perceptual systems in there.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And they do operate on an
entirely different frame.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether they have radically
different perceptions

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of the world or
not, if we weren't

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
coming to the end
of the episode,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I could tell you another story.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's get Richard's response.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, the
whole thing about it

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is it's all very
well and good to talk

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:90%
in terms of brain states.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But are you really
going to reduce it

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to a question of brain state?

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's take
something much simpler,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
which is-- well, let's
take something which

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:84%
is much more complicated
for a minute,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:90%
like the experience of God.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.330 align:middle line:84%
There are people who say, well,
there are some bunch of neurons

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.620 align:middle line:84%
in your brain
that, you know, you

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.240 align:middle line:84%
buzz it with an electrode will
produce an experience of God.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the experience of God is
just something in your brain--

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.170 align:middle line:90%
all well and good.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's also the case that if
you took the same electrode

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and prodded a different
corner of the brain

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that you would have an
experience of light.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't conclude from
that that light is

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.930 align:middle line:90%
just a delusion of the brain.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
It may be.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think we would have to
ask that question as seriously

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
about physical
experiences like that

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.314 align:middle line:84%
as we would about
religious experiences.

00:36:57.314 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's--
that's what comes to mind.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm, I like that very much.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, guys.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:84%
For the last question,
I'm going to ask you guys

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:90%
to reverse your position, OK?

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Howard, can you tell
us-- pretend for a moment

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that you've had direct mystical
experiences that totally

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:84%
convinced you of
the unitive nature

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
that consciousness

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:90%
underlies physical reality.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
best concise argument

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to a scientific
materialist to convince

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:90%
them that they're wrong?

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say,
how in the world

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
do you think this
universe got here?

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.210 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously a unity
of some kind that's utterly

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:90%
beyond our grasp at the moment.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And if there is, in
fact, a divinity,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the divinity is in every single
quark, every single force,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:90%
of this universe.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And the grand totality then,
absolutely astonishing--

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:84%
many totalities layered
with another totalities

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:90%
of which it consists.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And those things are so
far beyond your [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:10%
as a mere scientist that there
is no way you can even claim

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:10%
that your science covers any
more than the small grain

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.750 align:middle line:10%
of reality on a big, big beach.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Nice-- and Richard, pretend
that you're a arch scientific

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.830 align:middle line:84%
materialist having to convince
somebody who has a mystical

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
belief system that
there is no such thing

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:90%
as god or a divine source.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:90%
What would be your argument?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, these mystical systems
get very, very convoluted.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And they are very elaborate.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And there are a lot of
different religions saying

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different things
that are telling us

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.320 align:middle line:10%
that they and they alone
are giving us some sort

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:10%
of objective view of reality.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:90%
They don't often entirely agree.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I have
to wonder about that.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I have to kind of go also to
kind of an ad hominem argument,

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
is like, you know,
what kind of results

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:84%
have we gotten from all
of this religious stuff?

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's often a good excuse for
incredibly brutal behavior.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- not really
a logical refutation,

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
but it does bear
on it, particularly

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:84%
since religion is used as
a underpinning for ethics.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have this thing
that underpins ethics

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that's-- that's, you
know, seems to be

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:84%
used to justify all the worst
possible behavior there is.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:09.261 align:middle line:84%
You know, that alone would give
me some questions about it.

00:39:09.261 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, listen-- thank you
so much, both of you,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:84%
for coming and-- and hanging
out and-- and chatting with us.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate it
Howard, a great pleasure.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:84%
-Thanks.
-Richard, a great pleasure.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
-That was fun.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Hope to see you very soon.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:40.167 align:middle line:90%
