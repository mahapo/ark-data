00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.690 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Mind
Shift." "Mind Shift"

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.040 align:middle line:10%
is a unique talk show where
we take the time to explore

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.020 align:middle line:10%
important issues, ideas, and
viewpoints that you don't

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.380 align:middle line:10%
often see in the mainstream.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to look at
the prophecies of the Toltecs

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.030 align:middle line:90%
from Mexico.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Descendants of the Aztecs,
the Toltecs, like the Maya,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:84%
understood this time as a
threshold of tremendous change

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2006 I
published a book--

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:84%
"2012: The Return
of Quetzalcoatl,"

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:84%
where I explored the prophecies
of traditional and indigenous

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
cultures, including
the Hopi in Arizona

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and the classical Mayan
civilization of the Yucatan.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So in my work, I never proposed
we were approaching a doomsday

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
threshold or that we
would suddenly experience

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.385 align:middle line:84%
a dimensional shift or a mass
activation of the pineal gland,

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
or that we would suddenly enter
a singularity where matter

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.037 align:middle line:90%
and information became one.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I always thought it was going
to be more subtle than that,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and that 2012 was
an invitation--

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or let's say an
opportunity-- for humanity

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to become more
conscious and aware

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
or our impact on the planet,
and to change the direction

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.677 align:middle line:90%
of our civilization.

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:57.659 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:17.042 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.527 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Hey there, folks.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to the this
episode of "Mind Shift."

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Today we'll be talking
with Sergio Magana.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
He is Toltec lineage
holder who wrote a really

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.345 align:middle line:84%
fascinating book
called "2012-2021:

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
The Dawn of the Sixth Sun."

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And obviously I have a
personal interest in this book.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Years ago I wrote a
book called "2012--

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The Return of Quetzalcoatl,"
looking at the prophecies

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
of cultures like the classical
Maya that we've reached

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the end of a 5,125-year cycle.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And Sergio's work kind of
brings that into the future,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
looking at Nahuatl
prophecies, Toltec prophecies,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
about this time.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for being here.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited for
this conversation.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
ANNOUNCER: Sergio
Magana was initiated

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
into the 5,000-year-old
Toltec lineage

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.275 align:middle line:84%
Mesoamerica and has
become a respected

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:90%
healer in Mexico City.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.445 align:middle line:84%
Sergio is also a student
of the Tol shamanic lineage

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:90%
of Dreaming Knowledge.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Sergio believes that the time
to share this ancient wisdom

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
has come, and is one of the few
voices in the world sharing it.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder of
Centro Energetico Integral,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and hosts a daily radio
show in Mexico City called

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.863 align:middle line:90%
"2012-- the Days to Come."

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.262 align:middle line:84%
He also authored a
book called "2012-2021:

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
The Dawn of the Sixth Sun,
the Path of Quetzalcoatl."

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.612 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize nominee Ervin
Laszlo said of the book,

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
his writing deserves to become
a pillar of the new paradigm

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
wisdom we need as we enter
the critical years that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.502 align:middle line:90%
mark the dawn of the sixth sun.

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.967 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.432 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:54.727 align:middle line:84%
Sergio, I'm so
happy that you could

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:90%
join us, that it worked out.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Daniel.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:90%
So Yeah.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's start out by a little bit
of your history and biography.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Who is Sergio Magana?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
My biography.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Interesting-- no, not
interesting, my biography.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:90%
But I am Mexican, actually.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:10%
I am originally Catholic.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:10%
But my mother had to work.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised
really by my nanny.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
She was the daughter of the main
healer of the Otomi community.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So since I was a child--
-Which community?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Otomi.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Otomis are a community that
live close to Mexico City.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised in
the indigenous wisdom.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Because my nanny, for
example, instead of giving you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
an aspirin for a
headache and something,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.877 align:middle line:84%
she smoked and blew out the
pain and all those things.

00:03:40.877 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was really
raised in her way.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I began learning Otomi
and all those things.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I was very
young, I started

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to look for teachers of the
ancient tradition of Mexico.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And I lived a long path.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had to
go with the dancers

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that are with feathers and
drums and all those things.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was that strange?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So you were brought up in
a Spanish, Mexican context.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But then you found
yourself fascinated

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
by the indigenous culture.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Was that unusual?

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah,
very, for my family.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
When I started in these things,
they thought that I was really

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%
not-- but then I kept on.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I began looking for
the groups of dancers

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
where there are a lot of
keepers of the tradition.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
I was kind of rejected.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But then I was accepted
in the community.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found my first teacher
about dreaming, nahualism,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
that is almost lost in Mexico.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: So wait.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Nagualism?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.223 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Nahualism.

00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:90%
N-A-G-U-A-L?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
-N-A-H-U-A-L-I-S-M. Nahualism.
-Nahualism.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what that is.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Nahualism was the
ancient training

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:90%
for rulers and for warriors.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the training of
the sleeping state.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, there
are two divisions.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Tonal is who you are awake.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And nahual is who you
are sleeping or dead.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It could be like
a kind of spirit.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But nahualism is to be able to
be the master of the dreams.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
For us, in the tradition, the
dreams create the reality.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So this will be like
the dream of the dream.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So we learn, in all
these trainings,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
altered states like ensonacion--
that is dreaming while awake.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Or the obsidian mirror-- to be
changing because the mirror is

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:90%
like a dream.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are like half
states of perception.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is to
be lucid in your dreams,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to be controlling
your dreams, to be

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
shape-shifting in your
dreams, and to be able to move

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
reality through that training.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.611 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
teacher-- Hugo Nahui.

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And then--
-What was his name?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Hugo.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Hugo, and nahui is
four in Nahuatl.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So like I am Ocelocoyotl.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I am Sergio, Christian.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.004 align:middle line:90%
But Ocelocoyotl in Nahuatl.

00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
What does that mean?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.566 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Ocelocoyotl?
Coyote Jaguar.

00:06:01.566 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:90%
So he chose Hugo Four.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's his name.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.387 align:middle line:90%
And then I found--

00:06:08.387 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: How
old were you when you

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
started doing that training?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Like 19.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Like 20 years ago.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And then I found Xolotl.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Hugo introduced me to Xolotl.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
That is the one that has all
the counts and all the things

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that I wrote in that book.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That was the one that showed
me how to talk Nahuatl,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
how to make the etymologies,
and through the language

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
find the true meaning that the
ancient ones wanted to tell.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you said that when
you expressed interest

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in discovering this
knowledge, they

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
said that mostly, nobody had
discovered it because they

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
just weren't interested.
Is that right?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people say
that there are secret people

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that are holding
all those things.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Probably doing the Spanish
occupation-- because it

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
was forbidden to
be practicing this.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I asked Xolotl
why this wasn't shared before.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
no one was interested.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we
were hiding anything.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
No one was interested in the
ancient indigenous wisdom.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And how would they
trace their lineage back?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Back to different--
always in Mexico City,

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
or different tribal areas?
SERGIO MAGANA: No.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The Nahuatl is really-- there
is a language before Nahuatl

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:90%
that was called Uto-Azteca.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
That was originated in Utah,
actually, here in the States.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
From there it moved through the
North in Veracruz in Mexico.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it extended
to Mexico City,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
to Pueblana, and
to many regions.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was the language
of the Olmecs.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Because Olmec means their
lineage of movement.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Then the Teotihuacan then the
[INAUDIBLE], then the Toltecs

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of
famous in the world.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But we have other-- for
example, Toltec comes from Toli.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Toli is the measure.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So it really means the
ones that had the measure,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and the measure of the cosmos.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why then
the Toltecs trained

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:90%
the last part of the Mayans.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And from that, the
Mayans and the Aztecs

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.141 align:middle line:84%
created the calendars
that now are very famous.

00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I see.
OK.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
2012 a little bit.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like there's
definitely overlap between what

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
is understood about the
classical Maya interest

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:36.044 align:middle line:84%
in those dates and the
Toltec, Nahuatl understanding.

00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:37.910 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: It's similar,
but a little bit different.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The 2012 had to be
with the outer ring

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Aztec calendar.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:90%
You have one there.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So the outer ring
is the long count.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:90%
The long count is 26,500 years.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
That is like similar to the
procession of equinoxes.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But the Mayans
split that in five.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So they got the
kins, or the cycles

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:90%
of 5,000-something years.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: What's a kin,
again, just for the audience?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the big cycle
of the Mayans,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.651 align:middle line:84%
that is, I think, 5,000-- I'm
not a specialist in the Mayan.

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
But 5,000 something.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.116 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
5,125 years.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But for us, the main number
of the universe is the four.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the four is
repeated everywhere.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Like four elements,
four phases of the moon,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
two solstices, two
equinoxes, the four

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
main moments of
the day-- sunset,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
sun rising, midday, midnight.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So we split the
long count in four.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So we got bigger
cycles than the Mayans.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And for us, we named
those periods suns.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And the measure of a
sun is 6,625 years.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And for us now, it was
because only every five suns

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
we have the same date as
the Mayans of the shift.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: I see.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And in this time, we
have the same date.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Because then they change--
they will change 1,000 years

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:90%
before us in the next sun.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: I see.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And so explain,
from your book-- you

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
talk about how we're entering
this time of the Sixth Sun.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
We're actually in a transitional
period between 2012 or 201s--

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes you
even say it's earlier

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:90%
than that-- through 2021.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.635 align:middle line:90%
The Mayans have an exact count.

00:10:37.635 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, they say
it's finishing one day,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and the other day is the next
kin, We don't do like that.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We are more like nature,
that it could be night

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly it's
entering the day.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes day.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So for us, all the Toltec mystic
accounts are based in eclipses.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So for us, the transition
between Fifth and Sixth Sun

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
started in a full
sun eclipse that

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:90%
happened in Mexico in 1991.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That's when the Sixth
Sun began entering

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Fifth Sun kingdom.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Then for us, they
got the same power

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:90%
the 21st of December of 2012.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And then now,
slowly, the Fifth Sun

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
is going out to allow
the Sixth Sun from 2021

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to be ruling light for
thousands of years.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And why are eclipses
particularly significant?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we like-- for us, the
main division that people have

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:90%
is tonal/nahual.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, who you are awake
and who you are sleeping.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you see, in
an eclipse, the moon

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
is for us the representative
of the nahual,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
of the dreaming state, and the
sun of their sleeping state.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So when they are aligned is
when your tonal and nahual join.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you have an
opportunity to make a change.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the Toltec mystic
accounts are based in eclipses.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And why was this one in 1991
particularly significant?

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Because it was in Mexico.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very long,
complete sun eclipse.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the counts, it was
the beginning of the entering

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Sixth Sun.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it will end in
another eclipse of 2021.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That for us, the
keepers-- for example,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Virgin of Guadelupe--
that is the Virgin of Mexico,

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that for us in the
tradition is not

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:40.065 align:middle line:84%
a Virgin-- it was a codex that
[INAUDIBLE], an eagle warrior

00:12:40.065 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The position of the stars
that she has in the veil

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.875 align:middle line:84%
is the position of the eclipse
of 2021, when the Sixth

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Sun will enter completely.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I had heard that the
Virgin of Guadalupe

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
was related to the Aztec
deity of Coatlicue.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.589 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Kind of like it

00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:58.957 align:middle line:84%
was a way of
preserving that energy

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and taking it to
a Christian form.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: It's preserving
completely the tradition.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, for us
in the tradition,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
we must break the
prison of the moon--

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and if you see the Virgin,
she's stepping in the moon--

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:90%
to reach your own sun.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That means not the physical
moon, but your own moon,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:90%
the way that you dream.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It would be like the unconscious
for the modern culture.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Black Tezcatlipoca
for us, the mirror.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So she's stepping down the
moon and a black angel.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So the temple of
the Virgin is where

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the Tonantzin, the Mother
Earth, and Coatlicue, the force

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of life and death, existed.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's really the
preservation of all the counts

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and the mountains
and the tradition.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what's different,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
as we go into the Sixth
Sun, from the Fifth Sun.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: A lot of things.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, for us,
one Sun is of light.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And the next Sun is of darkness.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Not meaning good or
bad like people think.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It's that one is of the day,
and one is of the night.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Fifth Sun
that we're finishing

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%
is like being in the daytime.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.495 align:middle line:84%
So when you're awake,
you have the eyes opened.

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And where are you seeing?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Outside.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So where do you put God?
Outside.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do you put medicine?

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Outside.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And satisfaction?

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Outside.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And we come from a
long, long period there.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The religions are very
good in the Suns of Light.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone looks
for the solutions outside.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, we are entering
into a Sun of Darkness.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.275 align:middle line:84%
The Sun of Darkness is
when you close the eyes.

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And you must go to your inside.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.621 align:middle line:84%
So God goes back to you--
medicine, satisfaction,

00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why the formulas
that worked for hundreds

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of years, of religion
and all those things,

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:90%
are not working anymore.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:90%
People are not satisfied.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Now people that apparently got
everything outside-- families

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and probably success
and all those things--

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%
they are not satisfied.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:90%
They are looking inside.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Now that's why a
lot of people are

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
facing the crisis of depression
and all those things.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Because now everything
goes again to the inside--

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
to our underworlds
that are the things

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't solved
for us, and also

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:90%
for the dreaming state.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So in your book, you
said that as we go deeper

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
into the age of the
Sixth Sun, the dream

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
states become more significant.
SERGIO MAGANA: A lot.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Can you expound on that?

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Explain that a bit more.
-Yeah.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
The conquest of the inside will
be-- the part of your inside

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that is more important
is the dreaming state.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's like
the half of the path

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
between the one that reflects,
or the creator, and us.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So the studies of dreaming
in the modern culture

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:90%
started with Freud and Jung.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
But it was left.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And now it's coming back.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
groups of dreamers,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people that
are taking the information

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
back-- Yoga of the
Dreams, us in nahualism.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing what
you can do with dreams.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, we teach how to
heal your body through dreams.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that are completely sick.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And in one night, they
can solve what they

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:90%
haven't solved in their life.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And they wake up-- if they
found the dream of healing,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:84%
or the dream of change and all
those things, in one night,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:90%
they can solve the things.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is true.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people-- not a lot.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But some people who were blind,
for example, in the night,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and they find the dream,
they can see in the morning.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
-Are we in a dream right now?
-Yeah.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the dream
of the other dream.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
What does that mean?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
For us in Nahuatl
dream is the tonal.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So for example, yesterday
I was giving a workshop.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me, if
you want to heal someone,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:84%
do you have to have
their permission?

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, for us, no.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have the
idea of healing someone,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
it's that in the dreaming
state you agreed with that one.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
He asked for help
or you offered.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And you agreed to do this.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for me
doing the interview,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I know that we dreamt
about this before.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.066 align:middle line:90%
And now we are here.

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
Is there another way--
like, how would people

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
esoteric traditions

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%
talk about the dreaming state?

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
Like would people say the astral
realms or something like that?

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Astral dimensions?

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Or is there another way
to language it in a way?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
For us, there are 13 heavens,
from the first energy

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to become matter.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So the dreaming state is
in the seventh heaven.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And the movement is
the sixth heaven.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And the physical reality
begins in the fifth.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's why--

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
heaven in that sense?

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:90%
It was how it was called.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Ilhuicatl in Nahuatl
means heaven.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But we say that
there are dimensions,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
if we can modernize
the language, or steps,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:90%
in how energy becomes matter.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.307 align:middle line:90%
So give me the 13 in a quick--

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: The
13th heaven is for us

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.439 align:middle line:84%
Ometeotl, the unified energy.
-Start from one.

00:18:11.439 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And go up to 13.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Go from one to 13.
-OK.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
One is this.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:90%
The second is the physical moon.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:90%
The third is the physical sun.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The fourth are Venus
and the Pleides.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
They are, for us,
very important.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they rule the division
between tonal and nahual.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the fourth.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:90%
The fifth is all the stars.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The sixth is the
heaven of movement.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.414 align:middle line:84%
The seventh is the
white heaven, or where

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the moon,
the nahual of the moon,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
exists before the physical moon.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is the place
of the dreams.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:90%
The eighth is the yellow heaven.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It is where the spirit of the
sun, the nahual of the sun,

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:90%
exists before the sun.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It's where the destiny of
everyone here is related.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It is written in that heaven.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
The ninth is the blue heaven.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the one that
creates repetitive cycles

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
in all the universe.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
The 10th is the red.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
That is where the order of
the universe is established.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The 11th is where
the four main forces

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that we named Tezcatlipoca
live, and where

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
they create geometries of what
is going to be living here.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The 12th is where
the Ometecuhtli

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and Omecihuatl-- that means the
Mr. Two and Mrs. Two-- live.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
They are like the duality, the
first energy, split into two.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the 13th is the main
energy center, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:90%
of the Black Eagle.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.172 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: So what is the
moon, then, in your tradition?

00:19:49.172 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: The moon,
for us, was the sun before.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when the Fifth Sun
was created in Teotihuacan,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the legend says, there
were two essences that

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to be the sun.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And one--

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Essences being like spirits
or gods or beings of some sort?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah,
something like that, yeah.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Beings.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The one that was
supposed to be the sun

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
was afraid to jump into
the fire to become the sun.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:90%
So the one that was--

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It was like a sacrifice.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
He jumped.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And other was so ashamed
that he jumped after.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
So we have two suns.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they say
that they threw

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
a rabbit to the face
of the moon so that it

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:90%
could become moon and sun.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But for us, the moon is
the Black Tezcatlipoca.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So it really was the main
essence of ancient Mexico.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:90%
But it was almost erased.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Because for a
Christian mentality,

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:84%
when they ask, who is
the Black Tezcatlipoca

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
they say, the one that
gives you everything.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And they say, OK, like god.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
The one that takes
from you everything.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, like the devil.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The one that makes you reach
and the one that makes you pull.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:90%
So it was so dualistic.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
In a Christian mind, either
you are good or you are bad.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:90%
So they erased him.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.755 align:middle line:84%
And they only left
Quetzalcoatl--

00:21:07.755 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
the lightened one, the kind one.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But really, the
Black Tezcatlipoca

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:90%
is like the unconscious.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it's
the main essence.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that gives you
everything or takes from you

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And every work starts
in your darkness,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%
in your Black Tezcatlipoca.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And he rules the mirror.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And he rules the dreaming state.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And one of his feminine names--

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
What is the mirror
in that sense?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: The
obsidian mirror.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
For us-- for example,
the chacmools

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that are in the pyramids
that are kind of like

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.040 align:middle line:84%
turned like this in
the abs and like this--

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
it's our most advanced
discipline for dreaming.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But you must control of the--
because you breathe 13 times

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
each way.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you disappear
your face in the mirror.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you turn into a
serpent or a hummingbird

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want
to go to the mirror.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And then you lie down.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And from the mirror, your nahual
goes out to the dreaming state.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So the mirror, then,
is an entry or a portal

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:90%
into these other dimensions?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:90%
A portal.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
A portal to the dreaming
state and other dimensions.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: And
what you've just described

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the techniques
that you understand

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and that you teach now?

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
How long before I can turn
into a serpent and go up--

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
In the mirror?

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Three days.
-Really?

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
hear this and say,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
it sounds so sophisticated
that it should take a life.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:84%
In a real-- in a real,
real, real good training

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.821 align:middle line:84%
about mirror--
like in three days.

00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
So-- yeah.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It starts like this.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
You must be able to
disappear your face.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Then you must see your eyes.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:90%
The eyes must turn to red.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why they say
always in the Chronicles,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
the nahual was seeing
me with red eyes.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then your face transforms
into what you want.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: So that's
a practice where it's

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
late at night,
you're going to bed,

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
sitting up and you're

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
doing this meditation
or visualization

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.706 align:middle line:84%
or you're using
breathing techniques.

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
That's before.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The one complete
is before sleeping.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to do
that, you must have

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:90%
been trained in the mirror.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It can be in the
mirror, or it can be--

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
the Mayans did it in water.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:90%
We do it in the mirror.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But in water it's
much more difficult.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Because first you have to make
stable the energy-- the image.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Then disappear it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And then appear another.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And the water is moving.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.591 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult.
Well, at least for me.

00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I prefer the mirror.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So is your dissemination
of these types of practices

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.061 align:middle line:84%
part of this prophetic
transition that's happening?

00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Cuauhtemoc, the last
ruler of the Aztecs,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
gave a very beautiful
speech the day

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
before the empire
fell down, saying

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
our sun has hidden in the
darkness and all those things.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:90%
But keep our treasure.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Because with the Sixth
Sun, it's coming back.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish thought that
the treasure was gold.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And they tortured
him until death.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:90%
But the treasure was knowledge.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And exactly how he said, the
lineages are opening now.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The people that held the
knowledge are opening now.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And people are interested.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Because like Xolotl said,
no one was hiding nothing.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.337 align:middle line:84%
But people weren't
really interested.

00:24:10.337 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
What I kind of understood
from your book--

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and when we spoke
the other day I

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
felt like you corrected me
a little bit-- was that part

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of this idea of
the Sixth Sun was

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
that the dream and
the waking state

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:90%
were merging a little bit.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And in a way-- because what
a lot of people that I know

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
have been feeling
over the last years

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
is that they're discovering
more about synchronicity.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
They're discovering
more about how

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
the psychic and the physical
are more integrated.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And as people make
that discovery,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:84%
it's like reality itself becomes
a bit more like a waking dream.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.187 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of this transition?

00:24:41.187 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah, of course.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
We're entering into
a dreaming Sun.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So the states begin
mixing much more.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And people, even if they
are not lucid dreamers,

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
they begin knowing
what they dreamt.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.751 align:middle line:84%
And the deja vus are much
more, the synchronicity,

00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we are, in a certain
point, remembering much more

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:90%
dreams.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.167 align:middle line:90%
So that's why you say, OK.

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:90%
This is synchronicity.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.546 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Unless you smoke pot.

00:25:09.546 --> 00:25:11.279 align:middle line:84%
In which case you can't
remember any of your dreams.

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: OK, of course.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
No, the problem is that
you forget them more.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: So
a question is, then,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen in
terms of the prophecies

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to the actual physical
consensus reality

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.211 align:middle line:84%
that we share over the
next-- as we go towards 2021?

00:25:28.211 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We discussed it.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You said there may be more
earthquakes or more physical

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:31.669 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:32.965 align:middle line:84%
Is that still part
of the process?

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:33.664 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:33.664 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
That whole thing that
the world was ending

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
came from the prophecies--
Mayan and Toltec.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
They were really simple.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The prophecy just
said, the Fifth Sun

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
will finish with earthquakes.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
lot of suffering.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And everyone will die.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:84%
If you come from a Western mind
and you hear that, you say, OK.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.131 align:middle line:84%
They are saying that
the world is finishing.

00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Because for the tradition,
death means change.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But why don't they
just say change, then?

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in that-- probably they
didn't have the word change.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite interesting.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Because for example, for us,
alive, we have six deaths.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Conception is one death.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you stop being
dead to begin living.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Then birth is a sort of death.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you stop
being in the womb

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
to start to living outside.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
So all these things mean death.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:90%
So death is change.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Why will there be
a lot of suffering?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't
like to change.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:90%
That is a problem.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And earthquakes-- yeah.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:90%
There are being much more.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the solar
activity is increasing.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But also what it
means is that there

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
is a destruction between
each Sun and the next one.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And the order of the
Sun that is leaving

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is destroyed to
enter in a new one.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.515 align:middle line:84%
And if you see politics,
economics, and all the things,

00:26:53.515 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
they are kind of shaking.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
What is going to happen?
OK.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going to the inside.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:84%
First of all, for the
people that don't change,

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
they will face first
the underworlds.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:84%
The underworlds are
the repetitive patterns

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that you do, the patterns of
your ancestors, heavy emotions.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:90%
All these things will increase.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people will
face what a lot of people

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
said about cataclysm,
but a personal one.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you change, you
will go with the flow.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And for us, for example,
after the underworlds,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:90%
you can have to caves of power.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.657 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
The what of power?

00:27:29.657 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: The caves.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Caves of power.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.356 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:90%
That sounds nice.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.296 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: For
us, the training

00:27:34.296 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
is, first you must face your
underworlds and solve them.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you enter
into 20 caves of power.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So one way to discuss the
underworlds that would be maybe

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.815 align:middle line:84%
more quasi-modern
or scientific would

00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
be talking about the
subconscious programming

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.700 align:middle line:84%
that we've all gotten
from our family patterns

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and from our culture.
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Paradigms.
-Paradigms.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's a process
that people have

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to go through to
kind of de-program

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
from those subconscious
patterns and so on.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Or suffer.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And what are the techniques
from this tradition to escape

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%
those subconscious patterns?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, the most effective
that I know is the mirror.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a complete
mathematical process of 36 days.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But I have taught
thousands of people.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have heard a lot of times
that a lot of people tell me,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
36 days in the mirror did more
for my life than all the work

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:90%
that I have done always.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So what does that mean--
36 days in the mirror?

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Because you go to the mirror.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
your reflection.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Because for the tradition,
everything is a reflection.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually
the practice?

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You spend a certain
amount of time every day

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
looking in the mirror,
doing a breathing thing?

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.
No, no, no.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
You go and you disappear
yourself in the mirror.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And for us, the mirror is the
metaphor of the first creation.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So we ask the mirror to take
out the idea of us that is named

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
yocoia, what we think is
our history, the inner voice

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that is bombing you.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, you cannot--
your heavy creations.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And the main part is
to take out the enemy.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The enemy, that we
name in Nahuatl yaotl,

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is the part that sabotages you,
attacks you, makes you sick.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you see your
own enemy in the mirror.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you
disappear the enemy.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And you ask the
mirror to pull it.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a complete
discipline of going

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:84%
through all the stages or
names of the Black Tezcatlipoca

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:90%
to disappear them.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The destructive force of
the nahual-- for that,

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.852 align:middle line:84%
you also learn to change your
face into animals and all

00:29:33.852 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of those things, to see
whom you become sleeping,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:90%
or whom you become in death.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:90%
And you see the faces change.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.967 align:middle line:84%
And the first times,
it's like, ooh.

00:29:44.967 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: I've had that
experience through shamanism,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:84%
through psychedelics
like iboga, for instance,

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:90%
but not so much just without.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the amazing
thing of this.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you can have all
those experiences breathing.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:84%
What type of
breathing techniques?

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.180 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: We have
mathematical breathing.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, to
enter in the mirror,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:90%
we begin breathing in nine.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is mathematic.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because in ancient
Mexico, there were nine

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:90%
fractions of the day of night.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So to enter in the
darkness, you would breathe

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:90%
nine, and breathe out nine.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And then after 36
breathings of that,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
you begin entering
in the mirror.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
First you go and see
your image with-- we

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:84%
call it the
hummingbird perception.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:90%
But this is normal perception.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you soften
the focus and begin

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
doing the peripheral vision
and all those things.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And you begin disappearing.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But then we have a
specific technique

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.005 align:middle line:84%
to make the peripheral
vision less,

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and then to put the attention
in one eye or in the other.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the face
begins changing.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then is when you begin
to see all these things.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk a little
bit about what happens--

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:56.591 align:middle line:84%
as somebody who's been doing
these techniques for 19 years,

00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
you said?
Or something like that?

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:84%
20 years.
-Yeah.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:84%
What's your dream life
like at this point?

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
My dream life-- for
example, now, I prefer to be

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:90%
sleeping than to be awake.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:90%
It's so rich.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you get to be interviewed
for talk shows in your dreams,

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: I hope.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And without traffic and without
anything, you can be there.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.301 align:middle line:84%
But for example, we
have eight dreams--

00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:90%
No traffic.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:84%
That should be like the
14th heaven, probably.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.
That would be.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.505 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
For example, it's like a game.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you enter
in these places.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You have the codex to see
which ones are you changing.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, you just
say, no, don't go down.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.391 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the underworld.

00:31:44.391 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
And you are controlling it.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Then you recognize
yourself there

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
you transform into a serpent.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Then you-- and we
have many rooms

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:84%
of dreaming, like
the [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:90%
where you repair your nahual.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And you go there and
you ask for repairing.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Then you enter into the place
where all the dreams are red.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And you regenerate your body.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you create abundance--
whatever you want.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's so dynamic, and so fun.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And then in the last
levels of training,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:84%
we have, like, couples
and partners of dreaming.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And we make appointments there.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:90%
We see each other.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:90%
We cross to create things.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Then we discuss.
-Yeah.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I've actually had
experiences like that.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that to
be totally the case.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
How would you differentiate
this tradition from the dream

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:90%
yoga of Tibetan Buddhism?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: For
example, now, I

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
am touring, giving a
workshop about lucid dream

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:84%
with a master of
Yoga of the Dreams.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:90%
But it's very different.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, for us more
important is vivid dreams.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it's lucid--
that is, that you feel that you

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:90%
can taste and all those things.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
For example-- they
use it very different.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They use things-- far example,
if they recognize themselves,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I would transform myself
into a serpent or a jaguar

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They transform themselves
into the Buddha,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they create
dreams of compassion

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:90%
We create dreams of power.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:10%
But I think that one-- that's
why we are doing together,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:10%
Charlie Morley and me.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
one tradition has parts

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
that the other one is missing.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And the other one has parts
that the other one is missing.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.195 align:middle line:84%
So together we come
do a complete map

00:33:33.195 --> 00:33:35.201 align:middle line:84%
of the dreaming state.
-Awesome.

00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Well I think Bob Dylan once
said, you can be in my dream

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.971 align:middle line:84%
if I can be in yours.
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.

00:33:41.971 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Totally true.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we've run out of time
for this little discussion.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
fascinating material.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.017 align:middle line:84%
And it's very exciting.
-Thank you.

00:33:52.017 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have a
little panel discussion next

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
with a few members of the New
York kind of a Mexica shamanic

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.666 align:middle line:84%
underground, with Sergio,
to talk about the eagle

00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and the condor prophecies.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.771 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back
right after this.

00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
children in the New
York area about film.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm program coordinator at
their first high school, which

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle line:90%
is located in the South Bronx.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I came into these
ways back in 2008.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:90%
My family is from the Caribbean.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.240 align:middle line:10%
And I have indigenous roots,
as well as African roots

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:10%
and European roots.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:90%
But I knew about that.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But I never really had the
opportunity to walk and pray

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and participate in
these ways until 2008,

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
where I took a trip
on a film job to film

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:90%
a documentary in Colombia.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And there, the
documentary was filming

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.080 align:middle line:84%
indigenous ceremonies--
in particular, ayahuasca

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
eagle-condor ceremony.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman invited me
to partake in the medicine.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And so I agreed to.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And my life has
changed since then.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time I had a chance

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to be in an anipi, de
mescalito, also to partake

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in la Madrecita, which is the
ayahuasca, and Grandfather

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Peyotico, as well as San Pedro.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And a shift-- a huge
shift-- began there.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:84%
When I got back to
New York, my life just

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:90%
became with a different focus.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I was searching for a
center, a connection

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to this planet that
is our divine mother.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.475 align:middle line:84%
And in time, as I started
to accept these changes that

00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:84%
started coming into my
life, I was then introduced

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
to the community here.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And I began to walk with them.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced
to elders, who then

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:90%
took me on as an apprentice.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
interesting being

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:84%
a New Yorker and
knowing New York,

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and being in the film industry.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And then to incorporate
this other spiritual life

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
was really difficult, in
the beginning, to manage.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But with an open heart
and the confidence

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that I received
from the medicine,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and what lies deep
inside me, it's

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.240 align:middle line:84%
really starting
to form and become

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful harmony
of assisting people,

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.960 align:middle line:90%
helping people, and learning.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.726 align:middle line:84%
Really, I'm just learning to
humble myself to just learn.

00:37:34.726 --> 00:37:37.007 align:middle line:84%
Awesome.
And Dharma?

00:37:37.007 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
DHARMA PADRON DALY:
I am Dharma Gustina.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:90%
I come from Puerto Rico.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been living in New York
for eight years, almost.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:10%
My first contact with the
medicines from America,

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:10%
specifically from South
America, the ayahuasca,

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:10%
was 10 years ago in Ecuador.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Very beautiful,
transforming experiences--

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:90%
very healing, very powerful.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
I didn't have contact,

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:90%
even when I was looking for it.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.710 align:middle line:84%
In Puerto Rico, I didn't
have the opportunity

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.160 align:middle line:84%
to get in contact with those
medicines and those ways.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Until two years and a
half ago here in New York,

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:84%
where I was introduced,
through a friend.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.950 align:middle line:84%
He introduced me to the
community, which is pretty big.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:90%
The community's diverse.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Many, many teachers, also.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Different medicines,
different ways, the condor

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.234 align:middle line:90%
and the eagle together--

00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Vision quests.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Vision quests, for example.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very
transforming, also very

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:90%
healing and very beautiful.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It's so full of love and
community that I love it.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that I want
to keep exploring and learning

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and growing into those ways, and
with the people around me that

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:90%
have become already my family.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very much
looking forward to keep

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:90%
meeting new family members.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: And Sergio,
I mean particularly-- Salvadore

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and Dharma mentioned how
the plant medicines were

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:90%
helpful for them initially.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.860 align:middle line:90%
What about in your tradition?

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The Toltec or Nahuatl
traditions-- is it oriented

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:90%
towards those plant medicines?

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in
Mexico is looking

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because of the Castaneda
books and all those things.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think for the
Huicholas, they look for it.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But we have a rule
in the tradition

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that we must not
look for the plants.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
We must not look, hire
someone, or try to buy them.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:84%
If the plant finds you,
then you can experience it.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in my
case, I have done it.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Because a plant found me.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But I've never looked.
But in the--

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: How
did the plant find you?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
was in a temazcal

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:90%
That is a sweating lodge.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And the guy that was
guiding the ceremony-- I

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:14.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that he
was going to take out

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:90%
peyote and all those things.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
sweating lodge, it

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:84%
was for opening the vision
and all those things.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.050 align:middle line:90%
That we all had it.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.810 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it has found me.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:90%
But I have never looked.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:10%
But I know, for
example, that the women

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.220 align:middle line:10%
of the tradition-- they do much
more plants than us, the men.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.230 align:middle line:84%
In all the sweating lodges
and all those things that

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
they are doing--
not all, but a lot.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
They are having
peyote or medicine.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.410 align:middle line:84%
-What's the reason for that?
-I don't know.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we are forbidden
to go to their meetings.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.991 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
Yeah.

00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:48.660 align:middle line:90%
They are only women.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So I know because I have
women friends in the tradition

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.710 align:middle line:90%
that they are doing that.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.301 align:middle line:84%
There's no myth behind
it, or story behind it?

00:40:57.301 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They use it for more intuitive
things, and all those things.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I know what happens in
their sweating lodges,

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.580 align:middle line:84%
where there are all
the medicine women.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But they-- for example,
it's quite strong.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Because they have these
meetings, for example,

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.740 align:middle line:90%
in October for five days.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't drink water.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They are doing just dancing,
all the night, to the moon.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.380 align:middle line:84%
DHARMA PADRON DALY:
The Moon Dance.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they enter
in the sweating lodges.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And they eat peyote.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.635 align:middle line:84%
And then the grandmother says--
they have told me, because I am

00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:84%
not allowed-- like, you talk,
and boom, and the spirit

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
begins talking in women
and all those things.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So they do a lot more than us.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
whole concept of the eagle

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and the condor prophesy.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you all understand that?

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.334 align:middle line:90%
Or what does it mean to you?

00:41:46.334 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:84%
SALVADORE BOLIVAR
MADERA: For me, I

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.630 align:middle line:84%
mean, the eagle and condor
prophecy is-- as I've been told

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.970 align:middle line:84%
by several elders, it's not a
prophecy or a tradition that's

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:90%
accepted by all traditions.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.920 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it's a very
small community that looks

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and follows this prophecy.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But for me, as you said,
the medicine seeks you.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
about the medicine.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I just got hired on a job.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to be that
the actual medicine ceremony

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I was at was an eagle-condor.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it is something
that resonates with me.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I always kind of joke around
that I'm an eagle-condor baby,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.213 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: But
what does it mean,

00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:33.210 align:middle line:90%
exactly-- the eagle-condore?

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.676 align:middle line:84%
SALVADORE BOLIVAR MADERA:
Well, eagle-condor

00:42:34.676 --> 00:42:37.220 align:middle line:84%
as I know it is-- they
say the prophecy is

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that right about the time
when the eagle is almost going

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
to bring the condor to
extinsion-- eagle meaning North

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
America and condor
meaning South America--

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
that the condor and the
eagle will then fly together

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.520 align:middle line:84%
in harmony, in order to
bring upon great healing

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and the exchange of traditions,
exchange of cultures,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and exchange of medicines.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it's the North
and the South coming together

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and no longer battling.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't know,
in this time right now

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:13.150 align:middle line:84%
the South is dealing with a lot
of these petroleum companies

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:84%
destroying-- deforestation
of the forest.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And so at this time, it's
a very, very serious time

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:84%
for the people of the South
who have been trying to protect

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:84%
these traditions--
but more importantly,

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:84%
these medicines that are
contained in the jungle.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And so as I see
it, it is this time

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.430 align:middle line:84%
where the medicine is
almost-- and these traditions

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:90%
have extended their arms.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the way I see
it is like Mother Earth

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of extending her
arms of compassion

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:90%
to help us from ourselves.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the way we're
living in this time

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:90%
is not really in a good way.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the eagle prophecy
talks about how, at this time,

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.440 align:middle line:84%
these two traditions, these
two ways from the North

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and the South, will come
together in an exchange,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:84%
in a good way, of all the things
that they have-- of healing,

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of tradition, of song--
in this time that we have.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you reach
a tricky part.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Because some elders
are very traditional.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, we
only do it this way.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's understandable.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
the way they know.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.527 align:middle line:84%
And also that's how they
protected this way to this time

00:44:26.527 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have
this opportunity.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.526 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Sure.

00:44:28.526 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:90%
What about you, Dharma?

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.150 align:middle line:90%
How do you understand it?

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:84%
DHARMA PADRON DALY:
Well, what he said.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And also adding to
that, an example

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of how the condor and the eagle
reunite-- what I've heard also

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:84%
about the prophecy is that
before the European people

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:84%
came, these medicines and
these communities from South

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.881 align:middle line:84%
and North America were sharing
those medicines and those ways

00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:51.580 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And when the
European people came,

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:84%
they had the need,
in order to protect

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:84%
those medicines and those
ways, to separate and hide

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:90%
from the visible society.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And so they hid.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
coming together again.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The prophecy of the
condor-eagle is to reunite.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is that, for example,
the teepee-- which

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is where the native
people from North America

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.230 align:middle line:84%
do spiritual
practices and rituals,

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is used also for
ayahuasca ceremonies.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And also one of my
teachers, for example,

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:90%
is a young medicine woman.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:38.130 align:middle line:84%
She brings all medicines
together during the night.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the prophecy--

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to bring all medicines
together, and to share

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of each one.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Which is very different--
what each medicine does

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and the way it heals you and
the way it heals the community.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And also sharing the
rituals-- the way

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:90%
it's done, the way it's shared.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And how about you, Sergio?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.717 align:middle line:84%
Does that prophecy have any
meaning in your tradition?

00:45:58.717 --> 00:45:59.416 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.

00:45:59.416 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
have chants that say

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that the condor and the eagle
are brothers and sisters.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that before,
they flew together.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And that because of a
misunderstanding, they

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:90%
separated.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And I see it, really, like
the sharing of knowledge

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I work a lot with Andean
practitioners, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Andes and
all those things.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
they have brought me

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.270 align:middle line:90%
there to make rituals.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And they have come.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We shared the
dreaming techniques.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They have very,
very, very different

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.180 align:middle line:90%
ways of dreaming in the Andean.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:90%
For example, for them--

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.656 align:middle line:84%
When you say Andean, would
you say partially Incan?

00:46:43.656 --> 00:46:44.355 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:44.355 --> 00:46:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like the
inheritance of the Incas

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.160 align:middle line:90%
that are close to Cusco.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And they do a lot of
interesting things.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.625 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it's like the
sharing of the tradition.

00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And we do things together.

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think it's
part of that prophecy

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to bring people together from
different communities, also.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to put
the medicines together.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.930 align:middle line:84%
When you go to a teepee here
in New York, for example,

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:84%
you see people from
different countries,

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
world, sitting together.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
the beauty of it.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The communities have a
diversity and respect

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.657 align:middle line:90%
enough for each other.

00:47:22.657 --> 00:47:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So Salvadore, you
mentioned that you're

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.350 align:middle line:84%
working with young people, with
the Ghetto Youth Film Alliance.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I work for a
nonprofit organization

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.277 align:middle line:90%
called the Ghetto Film School.

00:47:31.277 --> 00:47:32.510 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Ghetto Film School.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.209 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:33.209 --> 00:47:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
ask-- one thing people

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
have written a lot about
is in modern culture,

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.470 align:middle line:90%
we lost initiation.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So young people, like
teenagers or adolescents,

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:84%
don't really have a
process where they

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.450 align:middle line:84%
learn about visionary states
or go on vision quests

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And some people even think that
this is a really major problem.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it might even be that
those types of initiations

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.550 align:middle line:84%
are necessary to fully
develop the brain.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Chilton Pearce
talks about the neocortex

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:84%
actually develops
in adolescence when

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.390 align:middle line:84%
people go through these kind
of initiation experiences.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So that you move from
just ego-based identity

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to kind of trans-ego.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You care for the tribe
or the community.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.841 align:middle line:84%
How do you guys see
how we can-- first

00:48:15.841 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of all, whether or not
you agree with that

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.173 align:middle line:90%
would be the first question.

00:48:18.173 --> 00:48:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, how do you think
we could maybe introduce

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.215 align:middle line:84%
these types of practices
to young people in a way

00:48:23.215 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that would be really helpful?

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I agree a lot.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Being in my experience of
working with the New York City

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:84%
youth, and also
being in these ways,

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that these practices are
sort of like rites of passage.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily--
it's teachings.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:42.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our youth are lacking
general, fundamental teachings

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.760 align:middle line:84%
on how to relate
with one another.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not just the youth.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.380 align:middle line:90%
It's even the adults.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the language that we use,
the effects of the vibrations--

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of that,
the teachings of honoring

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
your elders so that there's
a place and a source

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:90%
to receive the wisdom.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
All these fundamental structures
that we learn in ceremony

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:06.680 align:middle line:84%
is what's lacking in the youth,
and even in most of us adults.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the vision quest--
which comes from the Lakota,

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:84%
the Plains Indians-- is a
form of a rite of passage.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back in history
of all ancient civilizations,

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
they had some form
of rites of passage

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.740 align:middle line:84%
for the young men
and the young women.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So they can understand, what
does it mean to be an adult?

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And where is your place in this
society or in this village?

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you see in the youth
is that they're seeking for it.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But what our society shows--
what we have as symbolism,

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.430 align:middle line:84%
as rites of passage, is you
can finally go and drink.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do this
and you can do that.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens-- like for me,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I just finished my fourth
year of my vision quest.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 43 years old.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm starting
to see things

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.570 align:middle line:90%
in a very, very different way.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
teachings that I have

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.860 align:middle line:84%
received-- it's like
I'm starting to feel

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.660 align:middle line:90%
like I'm finally grown up.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
causes a confusion.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
growing up, for me,

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.170 align:middle line:84%
was like when you get muscles,
or when you can be on your own

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:90%
and get your own apartment.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That's me growing up.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:90%
And actually, it's not.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot of adults
who are looking and searching.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And having that
longing and searching

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.220 align:middle line:84%
can cause, and
open the door for,

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that
may not necessarily be

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:90%
as healthy to the individual.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think yeah, one way we can
introduce this is to-- which

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is one of the visions that came
to me in one of the ceremonies.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It's to do that, to
work with the youth.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't working with the youth.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I had worked with the
youth early on in my age.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And then I went off to do film.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been two
years that the medicine has

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.430 align:middle line:90%
brought me back to the youth.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's for a vision
of being able to have

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.550 align:middle line:84%
some sort of
program where we can

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:46.640 align:middle line:90%
take-- at least for the city.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.195 align:middle line:84%
We need to take these
kids out of the city

00:50:48.195 --> 00:50:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and take them into nature.

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And teach them the
interrelations of nature--

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:84%
how important the trees are,
how important these things are,

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.590 align:middle line:84%
how we are all part
of a sacred circle.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we say, what we
do, and even what we think

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and our intentions
that we put out there,

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.800 align:middle line:84%
affects everything
in that circle.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And without those
fundamental teachings,

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.070 align:middle line:84%
we then are put in
a state where we're

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.850 align:middle line:84%
at now, where we do-- with
our garbage, with our words,

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.550 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.783 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
it doesn't matter.

00:51:15.783 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the planet's
really, really feeling it.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's
unconscious of that.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:90%
What about you, Dharma?

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
ways-- I think it's

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.910 align:middle line:84%
very important for the youth
and for everybody in the world

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.570 align:middle line:90%
to connect with mother nature.

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Go to the simple, to
the basics, which is

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.640 align:middle line:90%
nature and respect to nature.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
foundations that we

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.031 align:middle line:84%
have lost through
societies, through history.

00:51:43.031 --> 00:51:44.930 align:middle line:84%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: That's funny
to be saying that as a New

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:47.300 align:middle line:84%
York City person, where we're
about as far as we can get,

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:90%
almost.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:90%
DHARMA PADRON DALY: I know.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a hard place
to practice that.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.067 align:middle line:84%
But it's very important that we
practice that here, actually.

00:51:54.067 --> 00:51:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I guess every now
and then we get

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.450 align:middle line:84%
a weed that grows out
of a sidewalk crack,

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and we can pray to it.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:90%
DHARMA PADRON DALY: Well, yes.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.047 align:middle line:90%
I have a garden in my apartment.

00:52:01.047 --> 00:52:01.880 align:middle line:90%
DANIEL PINCHBECK: Better.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I have many plants.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And I love them.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.610 align:middle line:90%
And I water them every day.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I talk to them.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.140 align:middle line:10%
I clean the water through
prayers, for example.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I pray to the water.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
powerful thing to do.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:84%
In terms of youth and
children, in these ways--

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in the way of the South
and North American,

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:24.990 align:middle line:84%
condor and eagle-- children
are very important.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:27.320 align:middle line:10%
And they are families, always.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.380 align:middle line:10%
The family is the
foundation of this path.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:10%
So you see babies
that are newborns.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:37.010 align:middle line:10%
You see grandpas,
grandmas, uncles,

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:10%
cousins, mother,
father, everything,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:10%
every part of the family.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen and what
I have experienced so far

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.640 align:middle line:84%
is that everything that is
done is done for the children.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.010 align:middle line:10%
And we honor the
children so much.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:52.260 align:middle line:90%
They're so important.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not like usually--
like many times, also,

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:84%
in this modern society,
when we gather,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:84%
we leave the
children on the side.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Let them go there.
We are here.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.510 align:middle line:84%
The they're there, in the
parties or things like that.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Not in these ways.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's all about them, and
making them feel special,

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:15.682 align:middle line:84%
and making them feel safe
and important as they are.

00:53:15.682 --> 00:53:16.615 align:middle line:90%
And what about you, Sergio?

00:53:16.615 --> 00:53:17.364 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:53:17.364 --> 00:53:18.430 align:middle line:90%
SERGIO MAGANA: It's interesting.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:22.360 align:middle line:84%
In the tradition, the
rite to transition

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.640 align:middle line:84%
from being children
to being an adult

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.510 align:middle line:90%
would be, go to the mirror.

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you can not only change
to animals and those things.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
ancestors in the mirror.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
You can see your own ancestors,
the ancestors of the land.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
told you what was good

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:90%
for you and for your community.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like a
training, seeing yourself,

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that will make alive in you
the spirit of community--

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.700 align:middle line:84%
not only what is good
for you, but what

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is good for your bloodline
and what is good for the land.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:59.700 align:middle line:84%
What you see, though, in
Mexico City, with young people?

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.355 align:middle line:84%
Is there an attraction to
this type of tradition now?

00:54:02.355 --> 00:54:03.315 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:03.315 --> 00:54:07.360 align:middle line:84%
We are so few-- I was in the
New Year of the Mexica tradition

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.530 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th of March.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And we were like 300.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:12.680 align:middle line:90%
But now it's awakening.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.550 align:middle line:84%
For example I have
a radio show there.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people come-- young
people and all those things.

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's just starting.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.930 align:middle line:84%
We were talking the other
day about Teotihuacan,

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and about what the
original function

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and purpose of that place was.
-OK.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.930 align:middle line:84%
According to that, that's
why now it's shaking

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot in the earthquakes.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Because the axis is moving.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So that it can align with
the planets and the stars

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, all
the centers that

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.610 align:middle line:84%
have moon temples
or moon pyramids,

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:53.220 align:middle line:84%
they were to absorb
the effect of the moon.

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, the
moon is like-- not

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:90%
feminine or masculine.

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, the moon
has a masculine name-- Black

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Tezcatlipoca.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So it would be to absorb the
energy of the moon so that

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the dream and the unconscious
wouldn't-- or the cave,

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.660 align:middle line:84%
how it's named in the
ancient tradition--

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.910 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't bother so
much the society

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:90%
and the society's more ordered.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So when these temples
are aligned, and finish

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the alignment, all these
temples of the moon

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:25.910 align:middle line:84%
will be reactivated to
absorb the excess of moon

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:90%
over the earth.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it will be a much
more ordered society.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
we would kind of make

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.070 align:middle line:90%
use of all these temples again.

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.780 align:middle line:90%
We would get them going again.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Polish them up and get
the pyramids working.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Working again.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Like a cosmic machine.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe use them as
initiation centers.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Probably they were used
like that in the old days.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people now
just go and see pyramids.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And they think that all the
energy of pyramids-- and they

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.450 align:middle line:90%
go up the moon pyramid.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they feel tired
and all those things.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:59.530 align:middle line:84%
They are in the energy that is
absorbing all the bad energy.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:01.180 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't climb there.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.926 align:middle line:84%
Only to release.
DANIEL PINCHBECK: OK.

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.550 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to add.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.410 align:middle line:90%
You had mentioned something.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, these temples-- one of
the main temples is our temple,

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.890 align:middle line:90%
our body.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.390 align:middle line:90%
We are a temple.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But you know, these ceremonies
help us clean out that temple,

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and realign it.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.220 align:middle line:84%
As one of my elders
says, the medicine

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.590 align:middle line:90%
is a precision instrument.

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Our body-- we are the medicine.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But how we eat, how we live,
our temples are inactivated.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And through some of these
different practices,

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:39.890 align:middle line:84%
these different
ceremonies, you begin

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to learn the inner secret
knowledge that you can gain

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.860 align:middle line:84%
when you begin to
communicate with that mirror,

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:49.720 align:middle line:90%
with the ancestors.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They teach you how to access
these portals within ourselves.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we come together as a
group to these centers to help

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:84%
activate those through
our ceremonies--

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.400 align:middle line:84%
through the Moon Dance,
through the Sun Dance,

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.180 align:middle line:90%
through the sweat lodge.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:08.200 align:middle line:84%
These are our portals that
would open so that we can bring

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that earth-- the energy
from the moon, the energy

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
from the sun-- back onto
this planet through us

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and through these temples
and these centers.

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I was learning
to understand that.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, the word
prayer, in today's

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.300 align:middle line:84%
society-- because
unfortunately, there's

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.590 align:middle line:90%
a big confusion about it.

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I like to kind
of use it-- for instance,

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.285 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned we see a piece of
grass coming from the sidewalk.

00:57:29.285 --> 00:57:30.540 align:middle line:90%
We sit there and pray to it.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, not necessarily.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But connect with it.
Understand it.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.430 align:middle line:84%
That's your Mother
Earth reaching

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:84%
through this concrete
barrier that we've put up

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to make a connection with us.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It's even as simple
as our ancestors

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.494 align:middle line:84%
used to walk barefooted
through woods and rocks.

00:57:46.494 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
certain connection.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:48.593 align:middle line:90%
They would put moccasins on.

00:57:48.593 --> 00:57:51.360 align:middle line:84%
We have shoes that are hard--
all these different barriers

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that we put on ourselves.

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It's that concept of
how we can access that.

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
everything inside of us.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just having the
understanding and the awareness

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and the elder and that way to
connect to what we have inside.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:09.860 align:middle line:10%
And as I've seen, a lot of
these ceremonies teach you that.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.010 align:middle line:10%
And that's what ceremony is.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice so that you
can learn to access that.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.470 align:middle line:84%
One idea I heard around the
traditional Mayan calendar

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:22.135 align:middle line:84%
was that when you learned
what your Day Sign was,

00:58:22.135 --> 00:58:26.200 align:middle line:84%
it represented kind of the
quality of intention or purpose

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.737 align:middle line:90%
that your life would have.

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about how people

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:32.390 align:middle line:84%
today have lost their sense
of intention in a way.

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:34.751 align:middle line:84%
Is that true for the traditions
that you're in, also?

00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:36.680 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA: Yeah.
They are very similar.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.510 align:middle line:10%
You have a number,
a glyph, or a sign.

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And that has a
tonal and a nahual.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It is said that there are 20
paths to the enlightenment.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.840 align:middle line:90%
For us, the word was flowering.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.751 align:middle line:84%
So through the number,
through the glyph--

00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to step
on that for a second.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.380 align:middle line:84%
The word for enlightenment in
their language means flowering.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.574 align:middle line:84%
It's so beautiful.
Anyway, go ahead.

00:59:02.574 --> 00:59:05.220 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
challenges that you have awake

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and sleeping for
flowering, and advantages.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.090 align:middle line:90%
So it can help you a lot.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, I understood my
life completely-- the things

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that I have lived-- when
I got my tonalamatl.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.886 align:middle line:90%
That is this story.

00:59:22.886 --> 00:59:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, listen.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank all of
you for being with us

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and for learning these
practices and sharing

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.390 align:middle line:90%
them, and growing with them.

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It's great to meet all of you.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:35.620 align:middle line:84%
SALVADORE BOLIVAR
MADERA: Thank you.

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.220 align:middle line:84%
DHARMA PADRON DALY:
Thank you for having us.

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.320 align:middle line:84%
SERGIO MAGANA:
Thank you, Daniel.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320 align:middle line:90%

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.320 align:middle line:90%
