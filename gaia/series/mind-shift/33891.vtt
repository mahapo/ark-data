00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:01.846
<v ->In the modern world,</v>

2
00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:03.786 line:15% 
people tend to see religion as an enemy,

3
00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.206 line:15% 
as a destructive force that keeps the masses

4
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.825 line:15% 
kind of ignorant.

5
00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:10.709
I also had a totally negative view of religion

6
00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.788
until I started to explore Shamanism.

7
00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.949
To my surprise, I found that my trips with substances

8
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.169
like ayahuasca, iboga and LSD actually seemed to

9
00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.608
confirm the validity of the mystical experience

10
00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:24.449
that religious texts have talked about through the ages.

11
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.028
Tom Roberts argues that the revival of psychedelics

12
00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.328
is a second reformation.

13
00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.949
Before the first reformation,

14
00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.928
the Bible was only in Latin and only

15
00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.588
priests could read it.

16
00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:36.729
After Martin Luther, everyone could read the

17
00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.308
Word of God and they could learn about the visions

18
00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.168
of the prophets for themselves.

19
00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.949
When psychedelics became widely available in the 60s,

20
00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.069
many people were able to access the same kind of experiences

21
00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.968
that the prophets had had.

22
00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.789
They would have mystical visions,

23
00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.148
attain a sense of unity with the cosmos.

24
00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:53.669
They could even speak to spirits who would

25
00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:56.088
introduce themselves as gods or angels.

26
00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:57.949
So, the question is, could we evolve kind of

27
00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.028
a new religious structure that encompasses these

28
00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:02.589
new revelations, or can a new expression

29
00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.558
of the religious impulse emerge in our time?

30
00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:10.458
(mystical upbeat music)

31
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.258

<v ->Hey everybody.</v>

33
00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.149 line:15% 
Thank you for checking in with us.

34
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.989 line:15% 
We're here for Mind Shift and today,

35
00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:42.429
we're interviewing the extraordinary

36
00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.988
psychedelic visionary artist, Alex Grey,

37
00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:48.520
whose work has become kind of emblematic

38
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.940
or archetypal for Shamanism,

39
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.600
for the psychedelic experience in our time and

40
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.861
Alex and his wife, Allyson Grey are co-founders of

41
00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:00.361
"Cosm," so welcome everybody and welcome to Alex.

42
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.121
<v Voiceover>Born in Columbus, Ohio in</v>

43
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.200
November, 1953, Alex Grey had an early

44
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.961
fascination with death.

45
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.860
He went to the Columbus College of Art and Design

46
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.921
on a full scholarship but dropped out and

47
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.001
made a living painting billboards.

48
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.560
Fate brought him to Boston and the Museum of Fine Arts.

49
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.841
It was during that time that Alex met the person who

50
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.420
would become his life partner and eventually his wife,

51
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.201
Allyson Grey.

52
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.540
His prolific output of art since then has included

53
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.061
everything from working as a medical illustrator

54
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.861
at Harvard University to perhaps his best-known work,

55
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:31.521
The Sacred Mirrors.

56
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:33.820
His paintings have been featured as the album art of

57
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.120
Tool, The Beastie Boys and Nirvana.

58
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.881
On top of this, his art has been featured

59
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:39.821
in solo exhibitions at Feature Inc,

60
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:41.780
The Tibet House, Stucks Gallery,

61
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.341
PS One, The Outsider Art Fair,

62
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.201
The New Museum in New York City,

63
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:48.001
The Grand Palais in Paris and

64
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.660
the Sao Paolo Biennial in Brazil.

65
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.821
In 2011 and 2012, the Watkins Review named him one

66
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:56.480
of the top twenty spiritual leaders alive,

67
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.480
along with the Dalai Lama, Eckhart Tolle, and Oprah Winfrey.

68
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:04.941
(applause)

69
00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:07.761
<v ->Thank you so much for joining us on Mind Shift.</v>

70
00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:09.821
It's great to see you, as always.

71
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.961 line:15% 
So, maybe start with a little bit about

72
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:13.181 line:15% 
your early career.

73
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.556 line:15% 
I mean, how does one get to be Alex Grey?

74
00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:20.995 line:15% 
<v ->Well, I was born in Columbus, Ohio and</v>

75
00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:25.995 line:15% 
my dad was a commercial graphic artist and

76
00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:28.355
he taught me how to draw.

77
00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:33.355
I loved monsters and I was fascinated with death, actually.

78
00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:40.236
Some of my earliest stuff is all skeletons and things.

79
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:43.955
<v ->What was it about death that you found so interesting?</v>

80
00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:48.955
<v ->I think the secession of life, you know?</v>

81
00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:52.095
It was just what happened.

82
00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:53.355
<v ->Did you have any idea of anything that</v>

83
00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:56.115
would come after death, or it was just the actual--?

84
00:03:56.115 --> 00:04:01.115
<v ->The question of it was unsettling and</v>

85
00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:06.295
draw me toward a very shadowy area, you know?

86
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:13.255
In the consideration of it.

87
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:17.515
And of course, I was probably filled with fear about it.

88
00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:20.695
What's the nature of life?

89
00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:23.935
And, I was later on, taking on a lot more

90
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:28.935
existential attitude of an absurd and materialist

91
00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:31.815
kind of reality.

92
00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:33.594
You know, I was buying into the kind of

93
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:38.594
reductionist worldview and by the time I was 21,

94
00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:45.175
I was pretty desperate and suicidal even,

95
00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:50.295
and challenged the Almighty to appear if there were

96
00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:55.595
such a thing.

97
00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.535
<v ->This was when, what, the 70s?</v>

98
00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:59.775
<v Alex>Seventy-five, actually.</v>

99
00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:01.575
75, so you were kind of a little bit past the '60s?

100
00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:03.414
<v ->May 30th, yeah.</v>

101
00:05:03.414 --> 00:05:08.414
And yeah and I was just getting out of art school and

102
00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:14.595
I had never tripped before.

103
00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:18.035
Anyway, I was saying goodbye to my professor on

104
00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:23.035
a street corner and this girl drives by and invites me

105
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:27.335
to her party later that evening.

106
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.695
And, the professor picks me up later that evening

107
00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:34.455
and he has a bottle of Kahlua and LSD, so--

108
00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:37.635
<v ->Mixed together or was it a choice, one or the other?</v>

109
00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.935
<v ->No, together. You know, they were in the same bottle.</v>

110
00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:42.955
This was our professor.

111
00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:46.295
And so, he offered it to me and I had never done it before

112
00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.015
so what the hell?

113
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:51.455
And then I shared the other half of the bottle

114
00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:55.095
with the gal who was throwing the party.

115
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:56.955
That was Allyson, of course.

116
00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:00.435
That was 38 years ago and it was a revolution

117
00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:02.335
in my consciousness, you know?

118
00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:07.335
From a very dark person, I found the light immediately,

119
00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:12.075
the light of God, the light of love was just around this

120
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:13.655
kind of corner.

121
00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:15.455
I was in the dark and going toward the light

122
00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:17.595
and it was all the shades of gray that brought

123
00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:22.595
the opposites together and I decided to change

124
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:25.695
my name to "Grey."

125
00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:27.755
<v ->I don't even know what your original, actual</v>

126
00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:29.295
original name was.

127
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:34.295
<v ->It was "Velzy," which is a famous name for surfers</v>

128
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:37.455
because Dale Velzy was a historic figure

129
00:06:37.455 --> 00:06:39.595
in shaping surfboards.

130
00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:41.675
It probably would have done me some good,

131
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.295
but I changed it to "Grey."

132
00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:45.855
<v ->When you say you found the light and</v>

133
00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.135
you found God, those are huge statements.

134
00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:49.535
Can you unpack that a little bit?

135
00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:53.635
What does that actually mean?

136
00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:58.635
<v ->Well, if I had bought into kind of a</v>

137
00:06:58.994 --> 00:07:03.994
flatland reality, that there was no Creator,

138
00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:11.494
this was a chance occurance that life grew

139
00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:16.696
in the way that it did,

140
00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:20.915
just a collection of random events basically

141
00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:23.956
that lead up to where we are.

142
00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:27.881
Even though, in hindsight that seems completely

143
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:32.881
unintelligent, that was my attitude and pretty much

144
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:37.341
a lot of the people that I hung out with and it was

145
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:40.121
a very cynical attitude, too.

146
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:45.121
So, the mystical experience kind of

147
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:50.581
turns that on its head and no longer do you

148
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:58.201
imagine that reality is composed only of a

149
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:03.461
material manifestation but an equally infinite terrain

150
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:08.721
of an inner world and an equally deep and

151
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:12.461
profound connection with source,

152
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:17.461
what feels like source reality, happens

153
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.640
and in the wake of a visionary mystical experience,

154
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.220
you're a changed person.

155
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.220
You have a sense that a divine intelligence exists,

156
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.800
that its basis is love and that you are an emanation,

157
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:44.180
one node,

158
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.581
of an infinitely one intelligence.

159
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:53.581
So, to have a sense of that without speaking,

160
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.800
and yet suddenly you have a sense of knowing

161
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.800
and comprehension that transcends your,

162
00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:07.960
even your life.

163
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.101
<v ->I have one question for you.</v>

164
00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:11.841
In the psychedelic communities that we kind of

165
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:14.361
both travel in, like the MAPS world and Erowid

166
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:15.441
and so on,

167
00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:16.621
there are lots of people who have had

168
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.721
profound psychedelic experiences that are

169
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.281
visionary in a certain sense,

170
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.540
but they don't make that jump to believing

171
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.940
there's a divine intelligence.

172
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.601
They see it more as a manifestation of our brain's capacity.

173
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:30.921
How do you--

174
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:33.260
I'm sure you know tons of these characters.

175
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.821
How do you explain that they've had the

176
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:37.901
same experience but they don't interpret it

177
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:40.301
the same way?

178
00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:45.301
<v ->Well, that they buy into a more, I guess,</v>

179
00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:50.801
rationally based altitude on trying to make a call

180
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.621
on whether that's real or not.

181
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:04.621
By and large, a mystical experience is

182
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:08.401
just about the most important experience

183
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.641
that people who have had them would say

184
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:14.281
at least in their lifetime,

185
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.960
the top five experiences of their lifetime,

186
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.840 line:15% 
you know and for many people,

187
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.480 line:15% 
it's profoundly healing.

188
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.761 line:15% 
For me, it was a choice whether I was going to

189
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.961
even "To be or not to be,"

190
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.461
helped to answer that, you know?

191
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.717
<v ->How old were you at that point?</v>

192
00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:34.837
<v ->Twenty-one.</v>

193
00:10:34.837 --> 00:10:38.798
<v ->I see. And the types of work that you are now known for,</v>

194
00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:40.937
it was still a number of years before you arrived

195
00:10:40.937 --> 00:10:42.977
at that work.

196
00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:46.137
<v ->Yeah.</v>

197
00:10:46.137 --> 00:10:51.137
Well, I not only, sort of found God in the light

198
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:55.801
that was just around the bend,

199
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.501
but I found God in the persona of

200
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:03.501
my partner, Allyson Grey and soon to be my wife.

201
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:09.261
So, choosing to be together and to continue our

202
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.721
psychedelic sacramental sojourns,

203
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:19.721
we arrived at the space of infinite love

204
00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:28.022
under the influence of the sort of,

205
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.002
container of our relationship.

206
00:11:33.002 --> 00:11:38.002
So, you talk about a proper set and setting for an opening,

207
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:45.921
a mystical opening, and you would imagine being supported

208
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:50.921
by those who love you as being strongly supportive of that.

209
00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:57.362
So, I think that finding Allyson and working together

210
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.301
and having dead on matched mystical experiences

211
00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:07.341
of the universal mind lattice,

212
00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:12.061
that was, for me, that was the deciding thing.

213
00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:15.701
When we had and described and starting drawing

214
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:19.121
the same exact mystical experiences

215
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.321
completely out of the body,

216
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:25.821
that was a mystical experience of the light that

217
00:12:25.821 --> 00:12:30.821
really changed us and in reoriented us to

218
00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:32.301
what we're doing now.

219
00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:33.921
<v ->There was some point you came into contact also</v>

220
00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:37.342
with Tibetan Buddhist traditions that had an influence also.

221
00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:38.301
<v Alex>Oh, yeah.</v>

222
00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:40.141
<v ->When was that?</v>

223
00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:45.141
<v ->Around 1980 or so, and '81, we developed a friendship</v>

224
00:12:49.662 --> 00:12:54.662
with Ken Wilbur and so he and some other friends,

225
00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:00.281
Mark Epstein and folks,

226
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:04.801
had introduced us to Tibetan Buddhism when I was

227
00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:08.441
working in a medical school in the morgue,

228
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:12.201
and because they knew that I was working with the dead

229
00:13:12.201 --> 00:13:15.881
and they thought that it would be good for me to get a

230
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:20.121
Tibetan Book of the Dead, and they gave me--

231
00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:22.661
<v ->Wasn't there a particular type of Tibeten Buddhist</v>

232
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.781
practice that kind of related to working with corpses

233
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:26.081
and that kind of interest?

234
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:26.921
<v ->Yes.</v>

235
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:29.641
<v ->What's that called? The Chad practice?</v>

236
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.661
<v ->The Chod. Yeah.</v>

237
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:36.661
Yes, it's a common practice for them to do that in

238
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:41.430
a charnel ground or in the burial ground.

239
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.890
That particular practice.

240
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.050
<v ->Types of meditations? Types of--?</v>

241
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.050
<v ->Yes. And it's a way of feeding the all-beings.</v>

242
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.670
It's a special, amazing practice.

243
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.730
Anyway, Ken Wilbur had basically said,

244
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.910
"I know you like all the spiritual paths,

245
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.890
"but chase many rabbits, catch none,

246
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.670
"so why don't you decide on one?"

247
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.190
And so I considered him a real spiritual friend

248
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.070
and big brother and he said just do it.

249
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.031
And then, you'll get the fruit of the practice a little bit

250
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:25.750
otherwise, just reading books, you're not going to get that.

251
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.650
If you study with a teacher, though,

252
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.670
and really hang out with them and get their transmissions

253
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.650
and do the practices, then you learn something about

254
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.650
the tradition and it's been hugely, deeply impactful.

255
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.210
<v ->So, then, is it ongoing practice for you?</v>

256
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.210
<v ->Yes, yes, but it's also, it's ultimately the Dzogchen</v>

257
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.050
non-dual tradition would have you embracing

258
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.630
whatever you're doing as part of your contemplation

259
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.131
and your path and to not seek a difference so much

260
00:15:06.131 --> 00:15:10.750
between meditation or contemplation and

261
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.770
your everyday life.

262
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.890
<v ->As long as you can stay in some kind of</v>

263
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.130
non-attachment or witness consciousness

264
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.670
or some state?

265
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.950
<v ->That's the idea, yeah, yeah.</v>

266
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.769
So, I'm not saying that I'm there,

267
00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:30.769
but it still informs that part of my practice

268
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.770
and I, you know, do go over the basics and Norbu,

269
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.330
Namkhai Norbu is just an amazing teacher,

270
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.350
who is really important for our spiritual development.

271
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.990
<v ->Let's talk a little about the LSD as a creative tool.</v>

272
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.910
Obviously, LSD is very much suppressed in our culture

273
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.090
and in a sense, you've been courageous as a kind of

274
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.650
outspoken advocate for that sort of experience.

275
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.930
What do you think of LSD?

276
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.090
Is there a danger to it, are there values to it?

277
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.950
What's kind of it's--

278
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.089
obviously, it erupted in the mid-century into

279
00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:13.990
the modern Western psyche,

280
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.730
discovered by Albert Hoffman,

281
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.250
like, what is this stuff?

282
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.371
(chuckles)

283
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:23.371
<v ->Well, of course, my interpretation of LSD,</v>

284
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:29.050
which is celebrating seventy years of age this past April.

285
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.610
April 19th, 1943 when Albert Hoffman took the first dose.

286
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.390
I feel like it was a historic and transcendental

287
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.350
moment of humanity.

288
00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.210
I think of it as a religious moment.

289
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:05.210
I think that Albert heard an angel calling him

290
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:10.871
to mix up LSD because it caused a consciousness

291
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.930
revolution that we're still in the waves and paroxysms of.

292
00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:25.351
What it did was to bring actual sacrament back

293
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.730
to the human experience of

294
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.730
Westernized white people who believe in science

295
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.230
no longer religion and anybody who has visions

296
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.750
is obviously hallucinating and perhaps psychotic,

297
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.770
maybe ought to be locked up and so,

298
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.890
in that kind of world,

299
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.890
when Hoffman, a scientist, brings forward a sacrament

300
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.470
that electrifies the mind and opens us up

301
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.410
to actual God Consciousness,

302
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.950
even if it's just a glimpse, you know?

303
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.950
The miracle of the psychedelic sacrament is something

304
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.210
that has been known about of course for millennia and

305
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.710
was at the actual cradle of both eastern and

306
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.610
western civilization and is certainly so important

307
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.570
to the Aztec and Mayan culture as well.

308
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.570
Actually, the old time religion was a sacramental religion.

309
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.930
<v ->You are talking about, of course, these are theories?</v>

310
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Alex>No, no no.</v>

311
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.050
This is science.

312
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.870
<v ->The mysteries of Eleusis?</v>

313
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.710
<v ->Yeah, the kykeon.</v>

314
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.990
The Greek mysteries.

315
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.030
It was the state religion for over a thousand years

316
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.950
there was a psychedelic culture.

317
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.710
You know, that's how Socrates and Aristotle

318
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.870
and all of them, they were tripping.

319
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.530
<v ->We don't know exactly what the components were</v>

320
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.710
of that potion.

321
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.931
<v ->No, but it was obviously a way to connect them with</v>

322
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:11.110
the divine in the same way that soma was a plant

323
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:16.110
sacrament that allowed the plant practitioners

324
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.790
to connect with a divine reality.

325
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.050
So, we have soma and the kykeon, two sacramets

326
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:26.050
at the cradle of eastern and western civilization.

327
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.650
So, it was a sacramental religion and

328
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.030
it was a real sacrament,

329
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.030
that is it got you to a state of connection

330
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:43.130
with sacred reality.

331
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.851
So, I think that with the re-emergence of LSD and

332
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:50.670
that leading then to the psilocybin from

333
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.150
Gordon Wasson and Maria Sabina,

334
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.750
the connection with the Central and

335
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.430
South American traditions and all the rest of this.

336
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:05.430
This is bringing forward actual sacrament again,

337
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.650
which humanity, except for the last few hundred years,

338
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.070
it's been suppressed.

339
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.350
<v ->And what's been the influence of these kind of experiences</v>

340
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.590
for you on your art?

341
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.610
It seems as if in your work you paint kind of

342
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.410
energy bodies, chakra systems.

343
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.430
Are these all things that you've kind of visualized

344
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.610
during visionary states?

345
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.610
<v ->Yes and some of them are more adaptations and</v>

346
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:40.230
adoptions of some of the light body yogic material.

347
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:48.010
I don't know every acupuncture meridian and point

348
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.850
just in my memory and things like that but I try to

349
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.850
weave in Eastern and Western medical understanding

350
00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.250
about the body.

351
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.250
So, it's trying to remap our understanding that there is

352
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:12.170
a subtle energetic system that is part of our body,

353
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.791
a subtle body as well.

354
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:20.110
<v ->I wanted to ask you why, on the one hand, your work</v>

355
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.070
is not taken seriously in the canonical mainstream art world

356
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.910
but on the other hand, it's been such an inspiration,

357
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.110
especially for young people,

358
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.511
kind of like a global youth culture.

359
00:21:30.511 --> 00:21:32.810
How do you see that dichotomy and

360
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.631
what do you feel about that?

361
00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:37.951
<v ->Well, it's an interesting phenomena.</v>

362
00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:42.951
I think it's an actual phenomena because there

363
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.990
are, worldwide, there's festival culture.

364
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.670
You're frequently, we meet you on the road

365
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.430
in Timbuktu or Australia or wherever.

366
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.430
So, all over the world there are tripping young people

367
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.810
who appear at festivals having an enormous amount

368
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.590
of fun and inspiration together.

369
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.590
And, this is a the visionary art phenomena has been

370
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.990
bonded with this festival culture and with millions of

371
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.710
people worldwide.

372
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.710
So, I'm seeing it in some ways as the kind of

373
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.490
folk art of this tribe, which we've loosely called

374
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:44.490
The Love Tribe, just because it is an expression

375
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.430
of a commonly understood consciousness.

376
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.430
As an expression of this special and

377
00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:00.490
sacramental consciousness,

378
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.490
it's united like a kind of sacred art with a population

379
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.530
and a community.

380
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.650
And so, in some ways, because people have been

381
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.050
tattooed all over with my artwork and in some ways,

382
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.390
does that not stand up to a New York Times Review?

383
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.210
<v ->You don't go after copyright infringement if</v>

384
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.690
they've got the tattoos?

385
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.771
(laughter)

386
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.790
<v ->No, we let them do that.</v>

387
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.130
It's awesome.

388
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:33.130
It's a walking kind of testimonial for the

389
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.171
impact of the work and it's mostly people who

390
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:42.171
have been validated in their own sacramental journeying

391
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.450
by the visionary art.

392
00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.450
And that's why there's a connection between the community

393
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.090
for whom it matters and

394
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.430
I would argue that it's also connected with the

395
00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.150
emergence of a planetary civilization,

396
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.771
because it's happening worldwide,

397
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:07.151
it's a return to the sacrament that's at the foundation

398
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:10.150
of both Eastern and Western civilization and

399
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:15.150
we're looking for a mystic core for a planetary civilization

400
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.430 line:15% 
because where else are we going?

401
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.910 line:15% 
We're kind of already there in some people's

402
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.871 line:15% 
global citizenry.

403
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:31.871
But, more and more, the internet is interconnecting us

404
00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:38.489
and I think it's a very exciting time.

405
00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:41.709
<v ->Thank you so much for joining us for this little dialogue.</v>

406
00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:44.109
(applause)

407
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:45.849
We'll be right back with

408
00:24:45.849 --> 00:24:47.109
Michael Mohammed Knight,

409
00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:49.629
author of "Tripping with Allah,"

410
00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:51.110
and then we'll have Alex back on to have

411
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.689
a little trialogue with Michael.

412
00:24:53.689 --> 00:24:55.029
So, thank you so much.

413
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:57.069
(applause)

414
00:24:57.069 --> 00:24:58.629
<v Voiceover>After a troubled childhood,</v>

415
00:24:58.629 --> 00:25:00.670
Michael Mohammed Knight converted to Islam

416
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.369
at the age of 15 and at 17 went to Islamabad, Pakistan

417
00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:06.209
to study the religion.

418
00:25:06.209 --> 00:25:08.609
In 2002, Knight wrote "The Taqwacores,"

419
00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:10.709
about a Muslim punk rock group.

420
00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.149
Professor of Islamic Studies at the

421
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:14.749
University of North Carolina, Carl W. Ernst,

422
00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:15.809
called the novel,

423
00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:18.089
"A Catcher in the Rye for young Muslims."

424
00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:20.989
The book also spawned a film adaptation and

425
00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:22.790
the start of the Muslim punk scene in the United States.

426
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.109
His most recent book, "Tripping with Allah:

427
00:25:25.109 --> 00:25:26.829
"Islam, Drugs and Writing,"

428
00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:29.249
details his experiences from an Islamic point of view

429
00:25:29.249 --> 00:25:31.169
with the Shamic medicine ayahuasca.

430
00:25:31.169 --> 00:25:33.009
The San Francisco Chronicle describes him as

431
00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:35.855
one of the most necessary and, paradoxically enough,

432
00:25:35.855 --> 00:25:39.905
hopeful writers of Barack Obama's America.

433
00:25:41.135 --> 00:25:44.235
(applause)

434
00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:46.075
<v ->Hey there, welcome back.</v>

435
00:25:46.075 --> 00:25:48.235
This is Mind Shift with Daniel Pinchbeck and I'm here

436
00:25:48.235 --> 00:25:49.995
with Michael Mohammed Knight.

437
00:25:49.995 --> 00:25:51.535
Great to meet you.

438
00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:54.255
Yeah, Michael, so you're prolific.

439
00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:57.615
You've written numerous tomes of various lengths.

440
00:25:57.615 --> 00:26:01.875
Tell me a little bit about your introduction to Islam

441
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:04.295
and how you kind of ended up taking this path.

442
00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:08.655 line:15% 
<v ->I'm kind of a weird guy.</v>

443
00:26:08.655 --> 00:26:10.495 line:15% 
This starts when I was 15,

444
00:26:10.495 --> 00:26:13.475
a really mixed up kid writing letters to Charles Manson.

445
00:26:13.475 --> 00:26:16.215
He wrote back, by the way, so I was like

446
00:26:16.215 --> 00:26:19.115
Charles Manson's pen pal at one point.

447
00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:22.215
At the same time I got into Malcolm X.

448
00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:23.715
This is the same time in the early 90s

449
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:27.235
when Malcolm X's presence in pop culture

450
00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:28.455
was just all over the place.

451
00:26:28.455 --> 00:26:30.515
I think Bill Clinton wore an X hat when he was running.

452
00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:33.635
It was at that level and there are a lot of X references

453
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:38.255
in hip-hop and I was just a wounded,

454
00:26:38.255 --> 00:26:41.235
angst-ridden 15 year old.

455
00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:43.476
<v ->Upstate New York?</v>

456
00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:44.916
<v ->Upstate New York, yeah.</v>

457
00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.636
The Finger Lakes area.

458
00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:49.295
I was looking for a way to rebuild myself and

459
00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:50.475
not the the 15 year old kid who

460
00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:52.495
writes letters to Charles Manson.

461
00:26:52.495 --> 00:26:55.895
Malcolm promised me something,

462
00:26:55.895 --> 00:26:58.435
a way of reconstructing myself, a way of constructing

463
00:26:58.435 --> 00:27:03.395
a certain kind of masculinity and because Islam was

464
00:27:03.395 --> 00:27:06.495
the portal through which he found himself,

465
00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:09.616
naturally I kind of gravitated towards Islam and

466
00:27:09.616 --> 00:27:11.855
when I was 16, I went to a mosque and

467
00:27:11.855 --> 00:27:14.595
officially became Muslim.

468
00:27:14.595 --> 00:27:16.695
Two months out of my senior year in high school,

469
00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:18.415
in Pakistan studying Islam.

470
00:27:18.415 --> 00:27:22.355
<v ->How frequently, how often--</v>

471
00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:24.375
are you from a Christian background?

472
00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:26.495
A white Christian background?

473
00:27:26.495 --> 00:27:27.315
<v ->Yeah.</v>

474
00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:29.175
<v ->Is it that frequent that people from</v>

475
00:27:29.175 --> 00:27:31.775
that background are jumping into Islam right now?

476
00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:35.695
<v ->Yeah, I grew up Catholic, kind of nominally Catholic</v>

477
00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:39.795
and I thought my story was really strange at the time.

478
00:27:39.795 --> 00:27:44.475
In the years since, as I've traveled and kind of

479
00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:46.515
put my own story out there,

480
00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:50.315
I will tell you that at that particular moment

481
00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:51.995
in American history. found Malcolm X,

482
00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:55.375
found the secret Islamic component of hip-hop

483
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:56.976
and went on similar paths as mine,

484
00:27:56.976 --> 00:28:00.775
with the various ups and down, with the kind of

485
00:28:00.775 --> 00:28:04.375
zealous conversions and heartbreaking disillusionments

486
00:28:04.375 --> 00:28:06.695
and the in-between spaces,, too.

487
00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:09.075
<v ->You ultimately, you went to Pakistan and ultimately</v>

488
00:28:09.075 --> 00:28:12.515
you involved with the Sufi order, is that correct?

489
00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:14.575
<v ->In the course of my travels, I've had instersections</v>

490
00:28:14.575 --> 00:28:16.715
with Sufism.

491
00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:20.615
There's a Sufi order that I took initiation into and

492
00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:22.695
I've dabbled in various other kind of expressions

493
00:28:22.695 --> 00:28:25.115
of Sufism but Sufism is kind of a big,

494
00:28:25.115 --> 00:28:26.315
a big construct.

495
00:28:26.315 --> 00:28:28.195
There's a lot of stuff and I've done a little

496
00:28:28.195 --> 00:28:29.775
bit of wandering in it, yeah.

497
00:28:29.775 --> 00:28:32.855
<v ->I guess just from my perspective of not knowing</v>

498
00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:35.795
too much, I see Sufism as sort of the esoteric aspect

499
00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:38.995
of Islam, kind of like Kabbalah is for Christianity

500
00:28:38.995 --> 00:28:40.375
or something like that.

501
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.455
<v ->That's certainly there.</v>

502
00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:46.015
There's also Sufis who are very kind of Sharia-compliant

503
00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:49.895
very kind of rigid and disciplined in their practices too.

504
00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:52.415
There's a wide spectrum within Sufi tradition.

505
00:28:52.415 --> 00:28:55.735
There are Sufi groups in certain times and places

506
00:28:55.735 --> 00:28:58.255
in history where they would walk around naked

507
00:28:58.255 --> 00:29:01.515
and spread ashes on their body and smoke weed all day.

508
00:29:01.515 --> 00:29:03.235
<v ->Like the Savvis in India?</v>

509
00:29:03.235 --> 00:29:08.235
<v ->Islam intersected with all these things and</v>

510
00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:12.615
Islamic tradition, what we call Sufism specifically,

511
00:29:12.615 --> 00:29:15.336
has taken on all kinds of different shapes.

512
00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:16.556
<v ->So tell me a little bit more about,</v>

513
00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:21.556
Islam often has a very negative connotation

514
00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:26.315
in sort of mainstream culture in the US.

515
00:29:26.315 --> 00:29:28.975
As somebody who has sort of delved deeply

516
00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.175
and penetrated deeply into it,

517
00:29:30.175 --> 00:29:33.455
can you explicate your own impressions

518
00:29:33.455 --> 00:29:36.935
and what you've kind of discovered in your path?

519
00:29:36.935 --> 00:29:40.275
<v ->My answer is always kind of the deconstructive move</v>

520
00:29:40.275 --> 00:29:42.555
because there are people who would claim a particular

521
00:29:42.555 --> 00:29:45.195
essence for Islam as being the most rigid,

522
00:29:45.195 --> 00:29:48.675
and intolerant and legally oriented and

523
00:29:48.675 --> 00:29:52.115
blindly ritualistic and blindly misogynistic

524
00:29:52.115 --> 00:29:54.558
kind of tradition and this is something constant

525
00:29:54.558 --> 00:29:56.837
and unchanging throughout history.

526
00:29:56.837 --> 00:30:00.875
Then, there's people who, justifiably so, take exception

527
00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:03.550
to that kind of essentialism and they construct

528
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.191
a counter-essence.

529
00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:08.531
Islam has always been liberatory and poetic and wonderful.

530
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:10.751
<v ->Who is an example of the second?</v>

531
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:15.091
<v ->There's all kind of reformist voices and not just</v>

532
00:30:15.091 --> 00:30:18.091
public intellectuals but just everyday Muslims trying

533
00:30:18.091 --> 00:30:21.591
to relocate what Islam means for them.

534
00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:25.151
So, people might pull towards--

535
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:27.770
Sufi tradition is often a means where people create

536
00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.711
this counter-essence, referring to people like

537
00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:34.613
Willmi or Hallaj or Abenel Arabi.

538
00:30:34.613 --> 00:30:35.753
People like that.

539
00:30:35.753 --> 00:30:36.933
But for me, it's all Islam.

540
00:30:36.933 --> 00:30:38.714
It's all Islamic tradition.

541
00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:41.134
So, I don't claim it as essence.

542
00:30:41.134 --> 00:30:42.613
I don't claim that there's this one unchanging

543
00:30:42.613 --> 00:30:44.994
character to Islam and that bothers a lot of people.

544
00:30:44.994 --> 00:30:46.094
They want there to be--

545
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.074
of course we know what Islam is.

546
00:30:48.074 --> 00:30:49.593
It's very evident that we know what Islam is.

547
00:30:49.593 --> 00:30:52.773
<v ->Some people argue that fundamentalism in general</v>

548
00:30:52.773 --> 00:30:54.874
is more of a post-modern phenomenon?

549
00:30:54.874 --> 00:30:59.334
That the kind of rigid contructs in Christian fundamentalism

550
00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:02.853
or Islamic fundamentalism are more like things that happened

551
00:31:02.853 --> 00:31:07.853
as a result of modern progress and pop media and

552
00:31:07.874 --> 00:31:12.034
all this kind of stuff that kind of forced all these groups

553
00:31:12.034 --> 00:31:13.973
to construct a more rigid identity.

554
00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:14.914
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

555
00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:16.934
There's a couple of things that have been happening.

556
00:31:16.934 --> 00:31:18.714
In the late 19th century, you can look at

557
00:31:18.714 --> 00:31:20.214
what Buddhists were doing.

558
00:31:20.214 --> 00:31:22.893
Japanese Buddhists are saying we need to get rid

559
00:31:22.893 --> 00:31:26.154
of all these cultural accumulations and return

560
00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:30.074
to the true Buddhism of the Buddha and wash away

561
00:31:30.074 --> 00:31:33.153
all these superstitions and folk religious type thing

562
00:31:33.153 --> 00:31:36.434
and Hindus are saying the same thing at the same time

563
00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:39.974
in different places and Muslims were doing that too.

564
00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:43.673
Muslims were saying we need to separate true, pure

565
00:31:43.673 --> 00:31:46.473
original Islam from all of these cultural

566
00:31:46.473 --> 00:31:49.014
expressions of Islam and we need to go back to

567
00:31:49.014 --> 00:31:50.294
what the prophet originally brought us.

568
00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:53.594
So, they are all doing the same thing in different ways

569
00:31:53.594 --> 00:31:55.053
so it very much--

570
00:31:55.053 --> 00:31:58.594
you know, ironically, the call to go back to the origins

571
00:31:58.594 --> 00:32:02.214
and shed all of this cultural accumulation,

572
00:32:02.214 --> 00:32:03.874
it's part of its time and place.

573
00:32:03.874 --> 00:32:05.834
<v ->You know, in some of your books it seems like you</v>

574
00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:09.854
actually do identify a lot with the figure of

575
00:32:09.854 --> 00:32:12.494
Mohammed himself, I mean,

576
00:32:12.494 --> 00:32:13.694
you discuss him a lot.

577
00:32:13.694 --> 00:32:14.614
In the recent book,

578
00:32:14.614 --> 00:32:16.053
"Tripping with Allah,"

579
00:32:16.053 --> 00:32:18.793
which obviously is one that is germane to my interests.

580
00:32:18.793 --> 00:32:21.373
Can you explain to me a little bit about

581
00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:24.773
how you consider Mohammed to be kind of an

582
00:32:24.773 --> 00:32:26.774
important figure for you at this time?

583
00:32:26.774 --> 00:32:30.134
<v ->I've had a very long and complex relationship to Mohammed</v>

584
00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:33.413
just because people make so many different choices

585
00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:35.033
in how they represent him.

586
00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:38.254
So, part of my own journey and it's taken a long time

587
00:32:38.254 --> 00:32:40.854
and a lot of books to kind of figure this

588
00:32:40.854 --> 00:32:42.094
one out for myself,

589
00:32:42.094 --> 00:32:45.594
was finding Mohammed as kind of a visualization

590
00:32:45.594 --> 00:32:47.694
of my ideal,

591
00:32:47.694 --> 00:32:52.494
not my ideal self but a self to strive towards.

592
00:32:52.494 --> 00:32:56.774
Just my idea of a perfect humanity.

593
00:32:56.774 --> 00:33:01.494
<v ->What qualities of Mohammed do you find have that?</v>

594
00:33:01.494 --> 00:33:06.494
<v ->His kindness, his patience, his care.</v>

595
00:33:09.173 --> 00:33:14.173
The way that he becomes kind of a template

596
00:33:14.934 --> 00:33:16.354
for myself.

597
00:33:16.354 --> 00:33:20.773
I can look at stories of how he treated people and

598
00:33:20.773 --> 00:33:22.453
see that as something I can attain towards,

599
00:33:22.453 --> 00:33:23.774
and something that I don't live up to.

600
00:33:23.774 --> 00:33:28.774
For example, a story as simple as he was in the mosque,

601
00:33:29.234 --> 00:33:33.334
and there is a Bedouin who walks into the the mosque

602
00:33:33.334 --> 00:33:36.614
and doesn't understand Mohammed's concept of modesty

603
00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:40.954
and even basic hygiene and cleanliness and

604
00:33:40.954 --> 00:33:42.114
the Bedouin just starts urinating in

605
00:33:42.114 --> 00:33:43.354
the middle of the mosque.

606
00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.617
And people are ready to kill him.

607
00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:48.777
All the prophet's companions who understand how the prophet

608
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.078
felt about these kind of things.

609
00:33:50.078 --> 00:33:51.438
They want to kill this man.

610
00:33:51.438 --> 00:33:52.257
And Mohammed's like,

611
00:33:52.257 --> 00:33:53.938
"Oh, let him go. Just pour water on it.

612
00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:55.857
"He'll be fine, he doesn't know what he's doing."

613
00:33:55.857 --> 00:34:00.298
And in my life, in all of our experiences,

614
00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:02.757
we can find people who are pissing on what

615
00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:04.098
we find sacred.

616
00:34:04.098 --> 00:34:06.077
This was a mosque, this man's pissing in the mosque

617
00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:08.558
and Mohammed gave better care to that man

618
00:34:08.558 --> 00:34:11.798
then I generally do when people piss on the things

619
00:34:11.798 --> 00:34:13.838
that I care about.

620
00:34:13.838 --> 00:34:16.237
Similarly, I've written a lot of controversial things

621
00:34:16.237 --> 00:34:19.938 line:15% 
and offensive things and I've found Muslims

622
00:34:19.938 --> 00:34:23.158 line:15% 
acting out that story with me,

623
00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:24.725 line:15% 
because in some of the things that I say,

624
00:34:24.725 --> 00:34:27.344
I'm basically urinating in the mosque.

625
00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:29.804
I'm taking things that people care about and challenging

626
00:34:29.804 --> 00:34:33.523
them sometimes very disrespectfully and provocatively so.

627
00:34:33.523 --> 00:34:35.984
There are people who still call me their brother after

628
00:34:35.984 --> 00:34:37.104
that experience.

629
00:34:37.104 --> 00:34:40.024
That's how I should be living out the example of Mohammed.

630
00:34:40.024 --> 00:34:41.584
<v ->What are some examples of these areas that</v>

631
00:34:41.584 --> 00:34:43.864
are so controversial that you delve into?

632
00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:46.364
<v ->Part of it is the person Mohammed himself.</v>

633
00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:48.724
There's a lot of different stories about Mohammed.

634
00:34:48.724 --> 00:34:50.124
They're not all flattering.

635
00:34:50.124 --> 00:34:51.764
They're not all positive.

636
00:34:51.764 --> 00:34:53.004
There's a lot of different ways that people

637
00:34:53.004 --> 00:34:56.344
choose to wrestle with those stories.

638
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.544
But, at different times in my life,

639
00:34:58.544 --> 00:35:01.744
I would kind of take the punk role,

640
00:35:01.744 --> 00:35:03.644
tear everything down.

641
00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:06.244
He's like the big patriarch and I'm kind of

642
00:35:06.244 --> 00:35:08.244
doing this whole "murder the father" thing with him

643
00:35:08.244 --> 00:35:10.644
and a lot of people take offense to that

644
00:35:10.644 --> 00:35:13.265
because he's someone who is very dear to people.

645
00:35:13.265 --> 00:35:16.684
<v ->I'm super-psyched to get into your--</v>

646
00:35:16.684 --> 00:35:17.964
let's start with that, actually,

647
00:35:17.964 --> 00:35:20.684
Tell me a little bit about what drew you

648
00:35:20.684 --> 00:35:23.244
to ayahuasca and how you kind of

649
00:35:23.244 --> 00:35:26.225
how you felt that you could kind of

650
00:35:26.225 --> 00:35:31.124
synthesize that interest with Islam in some sense.

651
00:35:31.124 --> 00:35:35.244
<v ->It's probably what I needed at that particular time.</v>

652
00:35:35.244 --> 00:35:40.044
I have a long story with Islam, with my life as a Muslim

653
00:35:40.044 --> 00:35:42.864
and I've had experiences that I consider to be

654
00:35:42.864 --> 00:35:47.784
profoundly spiritual, even approaching visionary

655
00:35:47.784 --> 00:35:51.584
experiences and then--

656
00:35:51.584 --> 00:35:52.864
<v ->Like what?</v>

657
00:35:52.864 --> 00:35:57.604
<v ->Well, for example, I went to Mecca in 2008</v>

658
00:35:57.604 --> 00:36:01.844
and there is an immense sensory overload

659
00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:04.745
in the experience of going to Mecca.

660
00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:06.824
Just the masses of people and the--

661
00:36:06.824 --> 00:36:08.924
<v ->Just for people who don't know, my understanding</v>

662
00:36:08.924 --> 00:36:11.924
is the Kaaba, the rock itself, is a meteorite?

663
00:36:11.924 --> 00:36:13.864
Is that correct?

664
00:36:13.864 --> 00:36:15.684
<v ->I don't think we're ever going to have the opportunity</v>

665
00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:19.124
to put it under scientific examination but that's

666
00:36:19.124 --> 00:36:20.164
what's been theorized.

667
00:36:20.164 --> 00:36:22.544
Because the narrative is that the stone comes from Heaven,

668
00:36:22.544 --> 00:36:25.604
so I think that if this was a stone that people experienced

669
00:36:25.604 --> 00:36:30.104
at one time as coming from the sky then it was most

670
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.304
likely a meteorite.

671
00:36:31.304 --> 00:36:32.663
<v ->And everyone moves around it obviously in a</v>

672
00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:34.164
certain direction.

673
00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:37.104
<v ->There's a ritual called tawaf where people walk around</v>

674
00:36:37.104 --> 00:36:40.145
the kaaba which houses the stone.

675
00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:42.044
<v ->And is there an esoteric understanding of</v>

676
00:36:42.044 --> 00:36:47.044
what, of the kind of future condition of,

677
00:36:48.044 --> 00:36:53.044
the results of this constant practice of putting energy in

678
00:36:54.464 --> 00:36:59.204
towards this particular manifestation?

679
00:36:59.204 --> 00:37:03.724
<v ->I would say that there's been a wide variety</v>

680
00:37:03.724 --> 00:37:06.864
of interpretations and there are people who do esoteric

681
00:37:06.864 --> 00:37:08.584
interpretations of it.

682
00:37:08.584 --> 00:37:11.784
The main thing for me as I engaged in the pilgrimage

683
00:37:11.784 --> 00:37:13.905
is this is something you need to do.

684
00:37:13.905 --> 00:37:17.744
This is part of the life of a Muslim and,

685
00:37:17.744 --> 00:37:22.244
for me particularly, it's part of walking in Mohammed's

686
00:37:22.244 --> 00:37:25.844
footsteps and it's not just the experience of

687
00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:28.524
the individual with God,

688
00:37:28.524 --> 00:37:31.564
because people do, they obviously they go to Mecca

689
00:37:31.564 --> 00:37:32.644
and they seek that encounter with God,

690
00:37:32.644 --> 00:37:34.904
that direct experience of the divine,

691
00:37:34.904 --> 00:37:36.724
but one thing I was looking for was an experience

692
00:37:36.724 --> 00:37:41.064
with people, that I'm a Muslim and I have this very

693
00:37:41.064 --> 00:37:46.064
angsty, alien relationship to many Muslim communities

694
00:37:46.404 --> 00:37:49.424
and the people in those communities and

695
00:37:49.424 --> 00:37:52.604
I'm trying to find myself as a Muslim on this planet,

696
00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:54.764
in my own lifetime.

697
00:37:54.764 --> 00:37:57.065
So, part of the experience of Mecca for me

698
00:37:57.065 --> 00:38:00.704
was reconciling myself to the extreme diversity,

699
00:38:00.704 --> 00:38:02.983
the vast diversity of Muslims,

700
00:38:02.983 --> 00:38:04.743
because there's a lot of good in that

701
00:38:04.743 --> 00:38:06.884
and there's a lot of problems, as is any tradition.

702
00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.264
<v ->But, to a certain extent, it was something you experienced</v>

703
00:38:09.264 --> 00:38:11.104
subjectively as a visionary or mystical,

704
00:38:11.104 --> 00:38:13.044
did it have that dimension to it?

705
00:38:13.044 --> 00:38:16.104
<v ->It was walking around the Kaaba itself.</v>

706
00:38:16.104 --> 00:38:17.424
There's a lot of off times.

707
00:38:17.424 --> 00:38:18.904
I was there for three weeks.

708
00:38:18.904 --> 00:38:23.244
There were times when I'm in this mass complex

709
00:38:23.244 --> 00:38:26.404
that the Saudi state is built around the Kaaba.

710
00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:29.944
There's escalators and all kinds of ceiling fans.

711
00:38:29.944 --> 00:38:33.884
It's a very modern kind of construction.

712
00:38:33.884 --> 00:38:37.024
I would just sit on the cool marble floor at night and

713
00:38:37.024 --> 00:38:42.024
just space out and the context of spacing out in that

714
00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:46.544
place that I have internalized as a sacred place,

715
00:38:46.544 --> 00:38:49.205
I did let my thoughts kind of go and it's not like

716
00:38:49.205 --> 00:38:51.064
a hallucination or something where I'm losing

717
00:38:51.064 --> 00:38:53.004
awareness of where I am but I am kind of going

718
00:38:53.004 --> 00:38:56.344
into places in my head and part of it was

719
00:38:56.344 --> 00:38:58.224
these kind of encounters with Ishmael,

720
00:38:58.224 --> 00:38:59.764
the son of Abraham who was central to the

721
00:38:59.764 --> 00:39:01.584
story of the Kaaba.

722
00:39:01.584 --> 00:39:04.964
So, I had those kinds of experiences at the Kaaba

723
00:39:04.964 --> 00:39:07.504
and at other places and then I kind of go into

724
00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:10.164
grad school and I start studying religion in a very

725
00:39:10.164 --> 00:39:13.304
academic way and that cuts off.

726
00:39:13.304 --> 00:39:14.504
So, what I was looking for with ayahuasca

727
00:39:14.504 --> 00:39:17.044
was kind of a way to get that up again,

728
00:39:17.044 --> 00:39:19.185
be more engaged from the gut.

729
00:39:19.185 --> 00:39:21.304
<v ->In the book, you go over the whole history</v>

730
00:39:21.304 --> 00:39:23.284
of the relationship between Islam and all sorts of

731
00:39:23.284 --> 00:39:26.064
different drugs and psychoactives and so on.

732
00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:31.064
Did that research provide kind of a safe ground,

733
00:39:31.131 --> 00:39:33.811
a foundation for you to then have that type of

734
00:39:33.811 --> 00:39:35.231
an exploration?

735
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.351
<v ->Absolutely, because the first question for a</v>

736
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:41.371
project about Islamic drugs is what does Islam

737
00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:42.591
say about drugs?

738
00:39:42.591 --> 00:39:43.611
What does the Koran say?

739
00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:45.511
What does the prophet say?

740
00:39:45.511 --> 00:39:48.532
And just kind of destabilizing the answers the people give

741
00:39:48.532 --> 00:39:51.551
to those questions allowed me a little bit of space

742
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:55.751
to engage myself and to find my own answer.

743
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:58.451
<v ->So, tell me a little bit about your encounters</v>

744
00:39:58.451 --> 00:39:59.691
with ayahuasca.

745
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:02.571
<v ->I had three.</v>

746
00:40:02.571 --> 00:40:05.011
The first was very unfulfilling.

747
00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:05.893
<v ->That was with the Daime?</v>

748
00:40:05.893 --> 00:40:07.473
<v ->Yeah I went with the Santo Daime and</v>

749
00:40:07.473 --> 00:40:08.512
they are very nice people.

750
00:40:08.512 --> 00:40:09.953
<v ->Santo Daime is a religion from Brazil</v>

751
00:40:09.953 --> 00:40:11.393
that uses ayahuasca as a sacrament,

752
00:40:11.393 --> 00:40:13.573
kind of a synchretic mixture of Christian and

753
00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:15.093
Indian elements.

754
00:40:15.093 --> 00:40:17.453
<v ->They were very welcoming.</v>

755
00:40:17.453 --> 00:40:18.433
I have nothing but positive things to say

756
00:40:18.433 --> 00:40:21.433
about the people that kind of opened that door for me,

757
00:40:21.433 --> 00:40:26.013
but I am very much a Muslim and my symbolic language

758
00:40:26.013 --> 00:40:28.952
that I've internalized and that I think in is a

759
00:40:28.952 --> 00:40:31.293
Muslim language.

760
00:40:31.293 --> 00:40:34.594
So, I'm going to this Daime ceremony and

761
00:40:34.594 --> 00:40:36.733
it's very explicitly Christian.

762
00:40:36.733 --> 00:40:38.492
There's pictures of Jesus and we're singing

763
00:40:38.492 --> 00:40:42.813
Christian hymns in Portuguese and stuff.

764
00:40:42.813 --> 00:40:45.652
I couldn't make that work for me.

765
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:46.974
I couldn't--

766
00:40:46.974 --> 00:40:48.853
<v ->Sounds like it wasn't such strong medicine also.</v>

767
00:40:48.853 --> 00:40:51.493
<v ->Yeah, it might have been that aspect, too.</v>

768
00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:56.493
I just couldn't make it my own.

769
00:40:57.473 --> 00:41:00.513
My second time trying it,

770
00:41:00.513 --> 00:41:04.993
I didn't have the DMT agent,

771
00:41:04.993 --> 00:41:07.413
I'm just drinking the vine itself.

772
00:41:07.413 --> 00:41:10.133
<v ->That's a good opportunity to vomit a lot.</v>

773
00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:12.293
<v ->That didn't even end up happening.</v>

774
00:41:12.293 --> 00:41:16.614
I'm at a counter-terrorism conference and

775
00:41:16.614 --> 00:41:20.393
I have the vine and I go during the breaks

776
00:41:20.393 --> 00:41:23.313
between panels and I have a coffee maker

777
00:41:23.313 --> 00:41:24.753
and I pour the hot water in and I'm just

778
00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:28.053
kind of vining out with all these CIA agents.

779
00:41:28.053 --> 00:41:29.652
<v ->That's very Hunter S. Thompson of you.</v>

780
00:41:29.652 --> 00:41:30.773
(laughter)

781
00:41:30.773 --> 00:41:32.993
<v ->That's what they say.</v>

782
00:41:32.993 --> 00:41:35.134
So, I didn't have--

783
00:41:35.134 --> 00:41:36.713
I had a good time.

784
00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:38.533
I went back to the room they gave me

785
00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:41.634
and I'm just kind of vining out but

786
00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:46.473
the third time was at a ceremony in Southern California

787
00:41:46.473 --> 00:41:51.173
and it was with a classically trained Shaman and

788
00:41:51.173 --> 00:41:56.173
there was no kind of doctrinal component to it

789
00:41:56.173 --> 00:41:58.013
that I had to sign on to.

790
00:41:58.013 --> 00:41:59.133
In other words, there

791
00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:01.693
was no very "we're Christian and you're doing

792
00:42:01.693 --> 00:42:04.185
"a Christian thing here."

793
00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:06.821
There was no kind of shared singing or anything like that.

794
00:42:06.821 --> 00:42:09.801
You go up to the Shaman and he gives you

795
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:12.921
your medicine and you just go back into your corner.

796
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:15.081
You have your sleeping bag and you have your bucket

797
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:17.642
in case you need it and you just close your eyes

798
00:42:17.642 --> 00:42:19.282
and you're just there.

799
00:42:19.282 --> 00:42:23.362
There's some kind of, there's breathing and

800
00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:26.581
there's music and stuff but that's what I need it to be.

801
00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:28.161
<v ->It sounds from the book like you had a profound</v>

802
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:29.961
visionary experience in that setting.

803
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:30.782
<v ->Yeah.</v>

804
00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:32.861
It terms of, I don't like words like

805
00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:34.921
"orthodoxy" and "heterodoxy" and "heresy"

806
00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:38.241
but it was off the chart heterodox heretical.

807
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:42.461
Part of what I went into it expecting or

808
00:42:42.461 --> 00:42:45.862
trying to prepare for was an encounter

809
00:42:45.862 --> 00:42:48.582
with the divine in feminine form.

810
00:42:48.582 --> 00:42:51.401
I had been lead to expect that this kind of

811
00:42:51.401 --> 00:42:54.821
happens a lot with people drinking the medicine.

812
00:42:54.821 --> 00:42:59.461
So, being a Muslim and trying to find a way into that,

813
00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:02.801
I looked to Mohammed's daughter, Fatima,

814
00:43:02.801 --> 00:43:05.922
as my window through to that.

815
00:43:05.922 --> 00:43:10.922
So, I have with me dust from Kaaba

816
00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:13.281
and the rock where Fatima's son,

817
00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:16.281
the prophet's grandson was brutally murdered

818
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:19.001
and I ingest that dust, so I'm ingesting the blood

819
00:43:19.001 --> 00:43:23.881
of Fatima's son, Hussein, before I take the medicine.

820
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:26.861
So, there's this kind of, this is how I'm prepping myself

821
00:43:26.861 --> 00:43:29.841
and I just say

822
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:31.321
(speaking foreign language)

823
00:43:31.321 --> 00:43:33.241
"My Lord, increase me in knowledge,"

824
00:43:33.241 --> 00:43:36.081
and I just go vibe out and I have my encounter

825
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:37.601
with Fatima and I'm not committed to the idea

826
00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:40.621
that this is something outside of me,

827
00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:45.021
beaming down to me or anything like that,

828
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.201
but yeah, I had my encounter with Fatima.

829
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:49.822
<v ->And it had a whole sexual dimension to it.</v>

830
00:43:49.822 --> 00:43:52.981
<v ->There was.</v>

831
00:43:52.981 --> 00:43:55.461
I feel like there was a purging of kind of masculine

832
00:43:55.461 --> 00:44:00.461
poison, not just exclusively Muslim masculinity,

833
00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:04.381
just growing up as a boy in America and

834
00:44:04.381 --> 00:44:07.201
ingesting that kind of masculinity also.

835
00:44:07.201 --> 00:44:11.742
It comes in the form of Fatima and not only do I

836
00:44:11.742 --> 00:44:16.341
have these very kind of explicit encounter with

837
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:21.341
Fatima herself but I become Fatima at one point.

838
00:44:22.321 --> 00:44:27.321
And, as Fatima, I have sex with Ali, her husband,

839
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:32.441
who is extraordinarily important in Islamic tradition.

840
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:38.121
I'm experiencing sort of a superior masculinity in Ali

841
00:44:38.682 --> 00:44:43.682
as Fatima and with Fatima, when I'm myself,

842
00:44:44.822 --> 00:44:47.501
she's naked and she tells me,

843
00:44:47.501 --> 00:44:49.541
she puts my hand on her and says,

844
00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:51.961
"This is the door to the mosque."

845
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:56.582
All the masculine, the religious stuff, the legal traditions

846
00:44:56.582 --> 00:44:58.101
and the books and the mosques and all that,

847
00:44:58.101 --> 00:44:59.341
it's trying to replicate the womb,

848
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:01.621
like this is the real power, this is where the mosque is.

849
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:06.621
So just that kind of that experience.

850
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:10.841
There was a lot of purging of boy pain, you know.

851
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:15.841
<v ->Why didn't you continue with ayahuasca after that?</v>

852
00:45:17.502 --> 00:45:21.902
<v ->Part of it is just a matter of the portals that I have</v>

853
00:45:21.902 --> 00:45:25.221
access to like I am open to it, I'm not against it.

854
00:45:25.221 --> 00:45:27.261
I had an extraordinary experience with it,

855
00:45:27.261 --> 00:45:29.302
I'm not opposed to doing it again.

856
00:45:29.302 --> 00:45:32.621
<v ->There's a sense that the visionary experience</v>

857
00:45:32.621 --> 00:45:36.182
always threatens any construct of a religion

858
00:45:36.182 --> 00:45:38.081
or any structure that anyone is trying to hold,

859
00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:41.342
because it's like this upsurge from this

860
00:45:41.342 --> 00:45:43.301
transcendental domain.

861
00:45:43.301 --> 00:45:46.801
Do you feel like there is a path there,

862
00:45:46.801 --> 00:45:51.801
that ayahuasca might shake down certain structures?

863
00:45:51.921 --> 00:45:56.361
<v ->Absolutely, because people want their religious bodies</v>

864
00:45:56.361 --> 00:45:57.901
to be consistent.

865
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:00.681
We want to be able to make an argument using our shared text

866
00:46:00.681 --> 00:46:04.681
that we are all referring to and to argue rationally

867
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:06.783
about what the words say.

868
00:46:06.783 --> 00:46:10.642
These questions are always thrown at Islam.

869
00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:14.081
Does the Koran advocate violence?

870
00:46:14.081 --> 00:46:18.421
Does the Koran advocate a misogynist patriarchy?

871
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:20.241
All these kinds of questions.

872
00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:22.321
We want to be able to go to the book and

873
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:23.621
flip through it and find a verse and

874
00:46:23.621 --> 00:46:26.281
prove rationally using the text

875
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:29.482 line:15% 
that the text says something and

876
00:46:29.482 --> 00:46:31.961 line:15% 
absolutely this medicine and

877
00:46:31.961 --> 00:46:33.241 line:15% 
other kinds of experiences like that

878
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:35.041 line:15% 
destabilize that because you have a source

879
00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:37.341
outside the text, a new filter, a new lens

880
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:38.801
through which you're reading the text,

881
00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:41.081
so there's definitely that component of

882
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:44.602
kind of tearing apart the construction

883
00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:46.282
that we're building with.

884
00:46:46.282 --> 00:46:47.061
<v ->Cool.</v>

885
00:46:47.061 --> 00:46:47.761
Thank you so much, Michael.

886
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:49.041
(applause)

887
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:50.161
It was great to talk to you.

888
00:46:50.161 --> 00:46:52.721
So, we'll be right back with

889
00:46:52.721 --> 00:46:54.141
Alex and Michael.

890
00:46:54.141 --> 00:46:58.211
(applause)

891
00:47:02.506 --> 00:47:03.787 line:15% 
Hi, everybody, welcome back.

892
00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:05.986 line:15% 
I'm Daniel Pinchbeck here

893
00:47:05.986 --> 00:47:07.486
with Mind Shift and I'm here with

894
00:47:07.486 --> 00:47:09.406
Alex Grey and Michael Mohammed Knight.

895
00:47:09.406 --> 00:47:11.646
I thought it was kind of a unique and interesting

896
00:47:11.646 --> 00:47:15.966
opportunity to discuss psychedelics and religion

897
00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:18.426
and the future of religion perhaps.

898
00:47:18.426 --> 00:47:19.986
I know you guys met backstage and

899
00:47:19.986 --> 00:47:24.606
we were discussing kind of is there an opportunity

900
00:47:24.606 --> 00:47:28.446
to kind of revitalize kind of the traditional

901
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:32.507
religious institutions with the type of

902
00:47:32.507 --> 00:47:36.566
sacramental visionary experience that

903
00:47:36.566 --> 00:47:39.227
sort of erupted back in the consciousness

904
00:47:39.227 --> 00:47:41.307
of the modern West over the later half of

905
00:47:41.307 --> 00:47:43.226
the 20th Century and into today.

906
00:47:43.226 --> 00:47:44.967
So I'll throw that out to you guys and

907
00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:47.766
I'm curious to hear your different perspective.

908
00:47:47.766 --> 00:47:52.766
<v ->Well, in a conversation with an ayayhuasca user</v>

909
00:47:56.429 --> 00:48:01.429
who, with their group, experienced being in

910
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.130
the Jewish temple where they also participated

911
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:12.210
and were part of that community,

912
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.810
they were able to use the temple and it conferred

913
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:20.810
an entirely new heart connection with the mystic core

914
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:26.829
of their tradition and that was because of

915
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:33.309 line:15% 
the sacred context that was supporting that

916
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:37.409 line:15% 
connection and of course, their complete

917
00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:39.769 line:15% 
attitude of

918
00:48:39.769 --> 00:48:44.769 line:15% 
taking in the sacred context and specifically

919
00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.851
doing it there so there is the possibility that

920
00:48:50.851 --> 00:48:55.671
a true sacrament, which would wake people up

921
00:48:55.671 --> 00:49:00.671
to divinity, which is at the core of all world wisdom

922
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:06.130
traditions might reignite or renew

923
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:10.050
a kind of mystic connection.

924
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:12.350
<v ->Just to back up a little bit.</v>

925
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.131
Just to go over a little bit of history of ayahuasca.

926
00:49:15.131 --> 00:49:18.671
So, in the 60s, the late 60s, the 70s,

927
00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:20.350
all the psychedelic compounds were made

928
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.251
highly illegal and characterized as Schedule 1.

929
00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:28.110
Peyote, however, having an exemption with

930
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:29.710
the Native American church,

931
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:32.670
that the Supreme Court tried to take away from them

932
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.891
I think in the early 90s, and tried to make it

933
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:38.091
a State by State issue.

934
00:49:38.091 --> 00:49:41.850
This lead to kind of uproars as I remembered,

935
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.291
and Congress was kind of pressured to

936
00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:44.670
issue an Emergency Religious Freedom

937
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.831
Proclaimation Act which protected

938
00:49:46.831 --> 00:49:48.990
the use of peyote by members of

939
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.791
the Native American church.

940
00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:54.130
Then, that was used as a precedent

941
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.631
for ayahuasca.

942
00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:58.510
First of all, the religion, there's two main syncretic

943
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.471
religions from Brazil that use ayahuasca as a sacrament,

944
00:50:00.471 --> 00:50:03.270
Uniao do Vegetalis and Santo Daime.

945
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.171
The UdV managed to win a Supreme Court case

946
00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:08.611
protecting the use of their sacrament,

947
00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:12.071
so there's now chapters of the UdV that are legally

948
00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:15.490
sanctioned, opening up in different cities in the US.

949
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.871
The second church is Santo Daime,

950
00:50:18.871 --> 00:50:21.410
which is the one that I've experienced and

951
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.010
it sounds like you also and maybe you as well.

952
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.531
<v Alex>I've done UdV.</v>

953
00:50:24.531 --> 00:50:25.790
<v ->Okay.</v>

954
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.790
They won a major Federal case in Oregon and it seems

955
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:33.250
likely or possible that that practice could also become

956
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.590
protected, just to give you a little background and context

957
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:36.950
to where we're at right now.

958
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.110
So, what are your thoughts?

959
00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.510
Could there be an enthiogenic reformation

960
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.411
or renovation of traditional religious structures,

961
00:50:43.411 --> 00:50:44.870
like Islam?

962
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.450
<v ->Speaking purely from my own experience,</v>

963
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:53.230
the day after my intense encounter with the medicine

964
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.030
when I had my Fatima vision and all that,

965
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:58.930 line:15% 
the next day I went to the mosque.

966
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:02.350 line:15% 
You know, the medicine's still in there.

967
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.791 line:15% 
I didn't throw up and it didn't come out the other end,

968
00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:08.171
and I'm doing everything by the book.

969
00:51:08.171 --> 00:51:11.110
I'm going in there more or less with all the

970
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.530
appearances of a conservative Muslim.

971
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.450
My internal understanding and the way

972
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.051
I'm processing it might be different.

973
00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:20.830
So, even if it's something that was wildly subversive

974
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.891
and heretical and challenging to what my sisters

975
00:51:23.891 --> 00:51:28.071
and brothers in the mosque would have seen as legitimate,

976
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:29.610
the medicine still actually connected me to

977
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.011
them in new ways.

978
00:51:32.011 --> 00:51:35.071
After I came home, I was going to pretty

979
00:51:35.071 --> 00:51:38.950
conservative mosques and just reading it differently,

980
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.290
feeling it differently.

981
00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:45.570
So, I think as different people encounter this and

982
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.091
run it through their own lives,

983
00:51:48.091 --> 00:51:49.450
something can actually,

984
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.111
it can definitely happen.

985
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:53.190
I don't know if it's a revitalization of tradition.

986
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.130
I think it will be something new.

987
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.230
We're all kind of swimming in the fishbowl

988
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.931
of our time and place.

989
00:51:58.931 --> 00:52:03.050
So, it will be something that's rooted

990
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.790
in our own experience and not just

991
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.091
things that came before us.

992
00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:09.671
Yeah, I think there's a lot of potential

993
00:52:09.671 --> 00:52:11.210
for things to happen.

994
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.991
<v ->I was interested when you discussed</v>

995
00:52:12.991 --> 00:52:14.150
your ayahuasca experience that you said

996
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.370
it was very much an experience of the

997
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:16.751
divine feminine.

998
00:52:16.751 --> 00:52:20.070
Obviously, in terms of contemporary critiques

999
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:24.571
of Islam, one of the main common complaints

1000
00:52:24.571 --> 00:52:28.011
is the sense that women are quite subjugated or

1001
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.671
their role is secondary in the religion and

1002
00:52:30.671 --> 00:52:32.311
what we're seeing in the contemporary

1003
00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:35.071
psychedelic world is very much kind of

1004
00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:38.551
this construct of the return of the divine feminine.

1005
00:52:38.551 --> 00:52:40.251
So I thought it would be interesting to get

1006
00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:42.070
both of you to talk about that a little bit.

1007
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.091
<v ->Yeah, I mean certainly I wouldn't pinpoint</v>

1008
00:52:45.091 --> 00:52:46.991
Islam as the one religion that gets gender wrong,

1009
00:52:46.991 --> 00:52:51.991
because not only is Islam historically unstable itself

1010
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:58.030
but certainly Christianity and some Asian religions and

1011
00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.611
Buddhism, you know, everything has some kind of

1012
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:05.311
gender issue.

1013
00:53:05.311 --> 00:53:09.450
But, absolutely, I was interested in the medicine

1014
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:12.651
as purging some of my masculine stuff.

1015
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:14.590
Not just from my Muslim experience but

1016
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.170
being an American boy raised on

1017
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.611
pro wrestling and GI Joe and He-Man and all that.

1018
00:53:19.611 --> 00:53:24.611
Yeah, I was looking at Fatima as being a feminine voice

1019
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:29.031
because the Koran, it does, to me--

1020
00:53:29.031 --> 00:53:30.710
<v ->There are some distinctions, I would think,</v>

1021
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:34.031
between the way the subjugation of women

1022
00:53:34.031 --> 00:53:36.950
in Judeo-Christian cultures and Islam,

1023
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.331
people would make some distinctions, no?

1024
00:53:40.331 --> 00:53:43.711
<v ->I mean, again, I wouldn't speak to Islam</v>

1025
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:45.990
as being a singular construct,

1026
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.551
or the separate kind of Judeo-Christian

1027
00:53:48.551 --> 00:53:50.530
thing either but--

1028
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:54.350
<v ->Is it an example, in Islam, of a subculture</v>

1029
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.070
where the feminine and the masculine

1030
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.711
are more perfectly balanced?

1031
00:53:58.711 --> 00:54:00.431
<v ->I don't know if that exists anywhere.</v>

1032
00:54:00.431 --> 00:54:03.031
(laughter)

1033
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.771
But for me, as a reader of the Koran,

1034
00:54:05.771 --> 00:54:09.091
my eyes and my ears I find the Koran

1035
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:11.310
speaking with a male voice.

1036
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.650
That was an issue for me.

1037
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.071
I wanted to see if there could be

1038
00:54:14.071 --> 00:54:15.411
a space for a feminine voice.

1039
00:54:15.411 --> 00:54:18.870
During my vision, my encounter,

1040
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.590
you know vision isn't always the right word

1041
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.070
because it wasn't just my eyes.

1042
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:26.271
I asked Fatima, "You know, what about the Koran?"

1043
00:54:26.271 --> 00:54:27.791
The Koran says this and this and this and

1044
00:54:27.791 --> 00:54:29.071
what do I do with that?

1045
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:29.890
And she says,

1046
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:30.491
"That's for the boys,

1047
00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:31.670
"you just stay with me.

1048
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:34.550
"The Koran is for the boys, you just stick with me."

1049
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:37.050
That was an Islamic experience for me.

1050
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.770
It wasn't textual.

1051
00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.950
She was walking me away from the text for a moment,

1052
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.450
but to me, I'm a Muslim experiencing Fatima.

1053
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.050
<v ->How to you situate that experience?</v>

1054
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.970
You say, from your perspective, was that a divine encounter?

1055
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.430
What that an act of creative imagination

1056
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.271
where you were kind of like,

1057
00:54:53.271 --> 00:54:56.571
in a sense making up a script and the astral energies

1058
00:54:56.571 --> 00:54:59.691
were allowing you to kind of build that script up

1059
00:54:59.691 --> 00:55:03.690
into some kind of direct perception?

1060
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.911
<v ->It could be both and like I say,</v>

1061
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:09.070
I'm not committed to the idea that it

1062
00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.691
has to have come from outside of me to

1063
00:55:10.691 --> 00:55:11.590
be worthwhile for me.

1064
00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:12.971
But, in terms of trying to contextualize it

1065
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:13.851
within the Islamic tradition,

1066
00:55:13.851 --> 00:55:14.511
there ought to be,

1067
00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:19.511
there ought to be also laws, attributes

1068
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:22.750
not manifesting, that might be the wrong word

1069
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.090
but expressed through creation and

1070
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.870
there is a gender component to that

1071
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.731
and we already talked that

1072
00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:32.670
men and women could recognize a law

1073
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:33.831
in each other.

1074
00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:36.051
Different attributes.

1075
00:55:36.051 --> 00:55:37.470
There's a story of the prophet.

1076
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.671
The prophet said,

1077
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:41.050
"The best of you is the one who is

1078
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:43.350
"best to his wife and I'm the best

1079
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.510
"of you because I am the best to my wives."

1080
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.191
And that's because he saw kind of the

1081
00:55:48.191 --> 00:55:51.791
divine attributes in his wives--

1082
00:55:51.791 --> 00:55:53.971
<v ->How many did he have again?</v>

1083
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:55.011
<v ->There's debate.</v>

1084
00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:56.331
There's debate about that because

1085
00:55:56.331 --> 00:55:58.851
there's questions of what constitutes a wife.

1086
00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:00.750
<v ->Five to ten? 15 to 20?</v>

1087
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:04.272
<v ->Not twenty but there are different estimates.</v>

1088
00:56:04.272 --> 00:56:06.790
<v ->What are your thoughts on that?</v>

1089
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:11.550
Divine feminine, re-emergence and how

1090
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.610
maybe that plays a part?

1091
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:18.610
<v ->In reading, there is a discussion of</v>

1092
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:23.770
the divine feminine as kind of the creatrix and

1093
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:27.410
as you were saying, the gender bias of

1094
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:32.151
creative imagination might be toward the divine feminine

1095
00:56:32.151 --> 00:56:37.151
because it's a birthplace of new insight and transformation.

1096
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:43.050
The creative imagination is evolution in process

1097
00:56:43.731 --> 00:56:47.391
and spirit is genderless or beyond gender,

1098
00:56:47.391 --> 00:56:51.431
but it's also coming into form and in our visions

1099
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:56.431
it's a way of the symbolic imagination and infinite

1100
00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.890
interdimensional nodes to come forward in a moment,

1101
00:57:05.331 --> 00:57:07.171
in an icon,

1102
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:10.070
and this is what the sacrament does.

1103
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:14.090
It allows people to have contact with this

1104
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:19.090
iconic visionary dimension and so,

1105
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:22.470
the symbolism, whether it was purely

1106
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.430
coming up in the magic 8-ball of your

1107
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:29.251
unconscious superconsciousness,

1108
00:57:29.251 --> 00:57:32.251
ultimately, what you're also learning

1109
00:57:32.251 --> 00:57:35.471
is that we're all interconnected so

1110
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:40.051
it's pretty hard to draw those boundaries exactly.

1111
00:57:40.051 --> 00:57:44.611
So, there's infusions of energies of all kinds

1112
00:57:44.611 --> 00:57:49.611
and the divine feminine becomes a symbol of balance

1113
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:56.970
for our era of overpaternalizing so the rise of the feminine

1114
00:57:57.371 --> 00:58:00.910
is an evolutionary force.

1115
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:05.910
The equalization or the harmonization,

1116
00:58:07.231 --> 00:58:10.051
the union of the opposites,

1117
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:15.051
is ultimately the way our species and all healing

1118
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:22.851
takes place in the coming together

1119
00:58:22.851 --> 00:58:24.490
of opposites.

1120
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:26.330
<v ->Something I heard you speaking about,</v>

1121
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.831
maybe remembered my kind of in a sense,

1122
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:33.831
pessimism about religion as a forward-going construct

1123
00:58:33.831 --> 00:58:38.310
it seems like there's always the visionary experience,

1124
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.471
the upsurge of that and that needs to take a form

1125
00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:44.611
or a structure which tends to blockade or obstruct

1126
00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:49.270
the next wave that wants to obliterate that structure

1127
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:50.291
and start again.

1128
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:52.711
Could you construct, theoretically, a religion

1129
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:57.331
or a form of esoteric expression that allowed

1130
00:58:57.331 --> 00:59:00.875
for this constant transmutation or transformation?

1131
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:04.169
<v ->I think there's a lot of possibilities and certainly</v>

1132
00:59:04.169 --> 00:59:07.689
religion itself is not a historically stable construct

1133
00:59:07.689 --> 00:59:10.129
in the sense that there's always been this thing--

1134
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:11.449
<v ->History.</v>

1135
00:59:11.449 --> 00:59:13.689
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

1136
00:59:13.689 --> 00:59:16.749
So, I think that absolutely as more and more people

1137
00:59:16.749 --> 00:59:19.749
are dissatisfied with how religion is often

1138
00:59:19.749 --> 00:59:22.209
conceptualized as this kind of organized

1139
00:59:22.209 --> 00:59:24.609
self-contained entity with very clear rules and

1140
00:59:24.609 --> 00:59:27.309
regulations and hierarchies,

1141
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:29.529
certainly there's a lot of people that don't want that.

1142
00:59:29.529 --> 00:59:30.789
They want something.

1143
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:31.849
<v ->You actually wrote about that a little bit,</v>

1144
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:32.809
about Islam itself.

1145
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:35.648
In earlier phases, you could be Hindu and Islam

1146
00:59:35.648 --> 00:59:36.889
and Buddhist and Islam,

1147
00:59:36.889 --> 00:59:38.909
like these things kind of interpenetrated.

1148
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:40.869
<v ->Well, there are certain times and places,</v>

1149
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:44.348
for example, Colonial South Asia,

1150
00:59:44.348 --> 00:59:45.650
when the British would take

1151
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.169
a census in a particular region

1152
00:59:47.169 --> 00:59:48.869
to see who was Hindu,

1153
00:59:48.869 --> 00:59:49.969
who was Muslim and the numbers would

1154
00:59:49.969 --> 00:59:51.909
add up to more than 100% because

1155
00:59:51.909 --> 00:59:53.649
people just didn't understand religion,

1156
00:59:53.649 --> 00:59:56.248
they didn't conceptualize religion in the way that

1157
00:59:56.248 --> 00:59:57.589
Western Europeans did.

1158
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:59.768
"Of course you can't be Muslim and Hindu,

1159
00:59:59.768 --> 01:00:01.009
"That makes no rational sense."

1160
01:00:01.009 --> 01:00:03.149
People didn't necessarily conceptualize it that way

1161
01:00:03.149 --> 01:00:04.770
and there were people in Southeast Asia

1162
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:08.769
who saw Ali, Fatima's husband, as Vishnu.

1163
01:00:08.769 --> 01:00:10.269
They saw him as the same entity and there

1164
01:00:10.269 --> 01:00:13.729
was no kind of illogical problem with that.

1165
01:00:13.729 --> 01:00:15.569
<v ->So, we'd be better off making less sense?</v>

1166
01:00:15.569 --> 01:00:18.209
<v ->I don't know that it's less rational.</v>

1167
01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:20.110
I mean, it didn't satisfy a certain idea--

1168
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:22.149
<v ->Absolutely, I get what you're saying.</v>

1169
01:00:22.149 --> 01:00:23.169
Cool.

1170
01:00:23.169 --> 01:00:24.629
<v ->It's a visionary logic.</v>

1171
01:00:24.629 --> 01:00:27.850
<v ->Very quickly, I wanted to maybe touch on,</v>

1172
01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.489
in our last few minutes here,

1173
01:00:29.489 --> 01:00:32.089
kind of art, counterculture.

1174
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.229
I know you've written about William Burroughs

1175
01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:37.069
and you kind of came out of kind of the 70s

1176
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:38.790
performance art kind of age of

1177
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.369
transgressive performance and so on.

1178
01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:42.549
What do you see?

1179
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:44.649
Do you see active countercultures now and

1180
01:00:44.649 --> 01:00:46.929
what do you see the value of those types of

1181
01:00:46.929 --> 01:00:48.869
more transgressive expressions?

1182
01:00:48.869 --> 01:00:53.869
<v ->I think that the shadow will always have a form.</v>

1183
01:00:56.708 --> 01:01:01.249
Right now, the corporate media,

1184
01:01:01.249 --> 01:01:04.768
I think, is a dominant shadow force.

1185
01:01:04.768 --> 01:01:09.768
So the alternative media forces will

1186
01:01:11.248 --> 01:01:16.248
find unique little pockets of minds

1187
01:01:16.669 --> 01:01:21.669
who are trying to undo the shackles

1188
01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:26.849
of corporate shrill advertising,

1189
01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:28.608
you know,

1190
01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:33.608
selling us on fear and death.

1191
01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:38.648
So, yes, there are also numerous artists

1192
01:01:42.528 --> 01:01:45.209
who will continue to engage that.

1193
01:01:45.209 --> 01:01:50.209 line:15% 
I think all of these are necessary.

1194
01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:53.909 line:15% 
We have to address and continually

1195
01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:56.429 line:15% 
examine our shadow element.

1196
01:01:56.429 --> 01:02:00.449 line:15% 
But, to focus only on it is to short the

1197
01:02:00.449 --> 01:02:01.809
other side of the coin.

1198
01:02:01.809 --> 01:02:03.609
That's to say there is no Heaven,

1199
01:02:03.609 --> 01:02:05.849
there's only Hell.

1200
01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:10.689
I think that a media that points toward

1201
01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:15.689
the internal infinite and the thing that binds

1202
01:02:17.289 --> 01:02:19.709
the different world wisdom traditions.

1203
01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:21.769
This is what we're looking for in the future,

1204
01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:24.949
a universal kind of spirituality and this is

1205
01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:29.349
why the Dalai Lama was promoting that idea.

1206
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:31.749
<v ->What about you? How would you see it?</v>

1207
01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:36.229
<v ->I want to be more optimistic than I am.</v>

1208
01:02:36.229 --> 01:02:41.229
<v ->Optimistic about what?</v>

1209
01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:45.649
<v ->The potential for spaces and kind of</v>

1210
01:02:45.649 --> 01:02:49.049
being productive in the shadows.

1211
01:02:49.049 --> 01:02:50.909 line:15% 
This thing that we call Islam that

1212
01:02:50.909 --> 01:02:53.349 line:15% 
we think is stable and consistent

1213
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:57.270 line:15% 
and very by the book throughout time

1214
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.589 line:15% 
that there are shadows within that

1215
01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:02.389
and that you could be in the shadows of Islam

1216
01:03:02.389 --> 01:03:04.488
and be in the shadows of quote-unquote

1217
01:03:04.488 --> 01:03:06.969
"The West,"

1218
01:03:06.969 --> 01:03:08.589
and that there's a lot of space for creativity

1219
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:10.469
and personal autonomy in that.

1220
01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:11.369
We'll see.

1221
01:03:11.369 --> 01:03:12.229
<v ->Well, thank you guys so much.</v>

1222
01:03:12.229 --> 01:03:14.588
