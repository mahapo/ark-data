00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is such an
incredible panel.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I always love my panels so much.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And today, of
course, we're going

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to talk about extraterrestrial
influences in human evolution

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other things, too.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to introduce
them first from the end.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:90%
At the far end is Steve Mera.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
He is a TV personality

with us at Conscious Life Expo.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a warm
welcome to Steve Mera.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'll tell you a
secret, he is so cool

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
that his photographs only come
out in black and white as well.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:10%
Emery Smith.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Next, she is an international

in the field of
extraterrestrial-related

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.622 align:middle line:90%
phenomena research.

00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
She has traveled
all over the world

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And she received an award
yesterday with George Noory.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's welcome Paola Harris.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.126 align:middle line:90%

00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:10%
Next, he started out as
nuts and bolts researcher

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:10%
into UFOs beginning
in 1975 looking

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
into the role of US presidents
and their connection

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:10%
to the phenomena.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:10%
He then, had experiences
that expanded his awareness

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:10%
into researching the role of
consciousness in understanding

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:10%
UFOs and extraterrestrial
contact and the secrets

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:10%
held by UFO experiences.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
He hosts The Cameron
Files on KGRA.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
All the way from Canada,
please welcome Grant Cameron.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.044 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:90%

Next, she is award-winning
TV producer, reporter,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.375 align:middle line:10%
and editor of the science
news website earthfiles.com.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.196 align:middle line:10%
We love earthfiles.com.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:10%
Co-host of Phenomenon
Radio on KGRA,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:10%
reporter for Coast to Coast
AM and her amazing Earthfiles

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:10%
YouTube channel, which you
have to see if you haven't.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:10%
It's fantastic.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:10%
She has dedicated her career to
productions concerning science,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:10%
medicine, the environment, and
interviewing whistle-blowers

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:10%
and eyewitnesses
to get the truth.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So glad to have
her with us again.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:90%
It's Linda Moulton Howe.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.464 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.264 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Next, It was going
to be Steve Bassett,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'll introduce him
when he gets down here.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:10%
Next to me here, he
is a rocket scientist

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:10%
who has built his first rocket
when he was 11 years old.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
He went on to become a leader in
the field of space technology.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
He has examined a
real UFO engine, which

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
was symbiotic and
alive and interacted

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:90%
with his consciousness.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, he gained
an understanding

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial craft
from a very young age.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Please give a big
welcome to David Adair.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.514 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to cover a lot
about are the ETs influencing

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:90%
our evolution.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Are they kind of stepping, up in
some way, our own consciousness

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and our own mind and
how we develop here?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And why would we ask that?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems like
there is some evidence

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
about this happening, such
questions as in the UFO

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:90%
crashes, of course.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's been
some back-engineering.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've discovered
integrated circuits.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And so many different
things have come from that,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
from the UFO technology.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
other side of it,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the contactees and
experiences, which is probably

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people here.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Whether you know it
or not, you probably

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
had some information in a dream
that wasn't really a dream.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I have had that.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And Grant Cameron has
been looking into that.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like there's some
knowledge and abilities being

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:90%
given to us from elsewhere.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It could be a UFO.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
It could be extraterrestrial.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It could be another dimension.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, there's also advances
in biological and healing

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:10%
modalities that have come from
extraterrestrial research,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:10%
such as some of the
things Emery looks into,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:10%
that could prolong our
lives and heal the planet,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:10%
and the dreams as well.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so all these things
seem to be teaching us ways

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:90%
of understanding the universe.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And also then, we get even
more questions to answer.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:10%
And so it seems
that we're gently

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:10%
being nudged to expand
our consciousness

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:10%
and find out more about
who we truly are and have

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:10%
a great understanding,
a greater understanding

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:10%
of the advanced civilizations
throughout the universe

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:10%
and other dimensions.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So each of our panelists
can speak a little, not more

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
than five minutes, please.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.814 align:middle line:84%
Please still be my friend
after if I have to ask you--

00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
If I say "thank you,"
yeah, please forgive me.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:84%
But they're all going to
say a little bit about this

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.943 align:middle line:90%
and their own research.

00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Try not to go over
five minutes, please.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Steve, would you like to start?

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I started in the subject
of ufology 36 years ago.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And after doing 15 years
of investigative research

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in the UK, I came
to the conclusion

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
expand my research

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
into the fields of the
paranormal, supernatural,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
parapsychological realms,
basically, because

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal aspects
to many of the UFO incidents

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.585 align:middle line:90%
that I was recognizing.

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I realized very
quickly that there were

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:90%
dividing boxes in this subject.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Numerous organizations
didn't look into the field

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:90%
of the paranormal.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And of course, a
lot of ufologists

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't really go there.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And the same for
paranormal guys, really.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:84%
There was no interest
in any, should we say,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the ghost hunting and
sort of things like that

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
wasn't getting into the field
of the ufological aspect.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can certainly
say for that,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
there's been plenty
of evidence to support

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
that all aerial
phenomena incidents do

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
have some elements
of the supernatural,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the paranormal,
extra-sensory perception.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that we
have to really divide,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:10%
take these boxes away.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:10%
We should never have had
those boxes in the beginning,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:10%
and bring that all together.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I spent another 15 years
in paranormal research

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and parapsychological studies.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:10%
And really came full circle
right back around to the UFOs

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:10%
and into the realms
of consciousness,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:10%
extrasensory perception.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And that these, be it UFOs,
whatever they represent,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
do have a conscious
connection with the observers

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and measure the intent
from the observers,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
just as we've seen in
military pilots that

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
had the shoot-down order on
UFOs during the 1980s in the UK.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.346 align:middle line:84%
They were told to shoot
them down, pilots.

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And many of them
actually reported

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
when they came to actually
just prior to pressing a weapon

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
lock, UFOs were conducting
serious evasive maneuvers prior

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to them even pressing it.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.717 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, how
did they know to do that?

00:07:50.717 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it's
just more evidence

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
to support that whatever
these constitute, these UFOs,

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that they certainly have
the ability of tapping

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
in to our consciousness and
realizing what our intent is,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
be it, we want to take
a photograph, film them

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
or, of course, when
pilots are actually

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:90%
engaging in combat with them.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.174 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:13.174 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE] Emery Smith.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.804 align:middle line:10%
Is this on?

00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>> You can hear me?

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Houston?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, my story is
pretty long and drawn out.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:10%
But in a nutshell,
in five minutes,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:10%
I was born in
Plainfield, New Jersey.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:10%
I moved at a young age
to southern Florida

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:10%
to a self-sustainable farm
that my family started up.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:10%
And my father was a engine
and diesel mechanic.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:10%
So, you know, I had to change
all the oil in the tractors

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:10%
by age 10 and
learn how to change

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:10%
the pistons and rings out of
the engines by the next year.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:10%
So I got to learn mechanics
really quickly, also

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:10%
about circuitry and electronics
and solar panels and things

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.216 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:10%
I joined Civil Air
Patrol when I was 13.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:10%
That's a small auxiliary
of the Air Force

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:10%
that train in search and
rescue and also allows

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:10%
children to get their pilot's
license at a very young age.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:10%
So I went through that
process and Army ROTC

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:10%
and right when I turned
18, I was in the military.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:10%
I was already going there
two years before, signed up.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:10%
And I thought I was going
to be flying F-15 Eagles.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:10%
That's what I really wanted
to do, and maybe become

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:10%
an astronaut at some point.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:10%
And the army offered
me a scholarship

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.155 align:middle line:10%
to fly Apache helicopters,
and they had programs.

00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to
go the Air Force.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:10%
My dad was in the army and my
grandfather was in the Navy.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:10%
So instead, they had
a medical program.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And it seemed really appealing.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:10%
I was very scientific.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:10%
Ever since they took my toenails
off when I played soccer

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.472 align:middle line:10%
for ingrown toenails, I
would watch the procedure

00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and the doctors like,
you might want look away.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:10%
I said, no.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:10%
This is so cool.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:10%
I can't feel anything and
you're ripping my toenail off.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:10%
And so I was really into
science and biology and things

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:10%
My mother made me start
typing at a very young age

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.328 align:middle line:10%
the National Geographic books
on an old typewriter, which

00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't stand because
I got big fingers.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:10%
And I still don't
type very well.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:10%
Sorry, mom.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:10%
And after that,
though, the education

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:10%
is great because my family
was always educating me.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:10%
It was a constant
educational process.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:10%
I was visited by ETs around
the age of eight or nine

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:10%
when a craft came over
the lake at our house

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:10%
and I saw all three
beings in the craft.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:10%
And it was just a very,
very fast telepathy type

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:10%
of language.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:10%
And they zipped out.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:10%
And I went inside and
told my mom and dad.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said, just
don't talk about it.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:10%
So they kind of knew
already something,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't tell me
until on their deathbed

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:10%
of what was really happening.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.637 align:middle line:10%
They're both gone now.

00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:10%
So that led me to
go in the Air Force.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:10%
I was in the Air Force.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:10%
And I took up
surgical technology,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:10%
surgical first assist and
became a teacher for that.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was asked to do some
moonlighting procedures

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.505 align:middle line:90%
in the evenings for extra money.

00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was great.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was organ
harvesting for fallen soldiers

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
that we were going to be doing.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:10%
But definitely, it was not that.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It was taking tissue samples.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And for the record, I know
a couple of my colleagues

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:90%
had said 3,000 alien autopsies.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:90%
That's incorrect.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It was 3,000
specimen collections.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:10%
I did get into the bodies later
on, but most of what I did

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:10%
was just taking specimens
from different parts

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:10%
of the tissue that was there
in a very highly-classified

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:10%
underground facility
under Sandia Labs

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:10%
there in Kirtland Air Force
Base and also Los Alamos Labs.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't work for Los
Alamos Labs or Sandia Labs.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:10%
All those underground
facilities and all

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:10%
the different
compartmentalization areas

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:10%
down there were all rented
out by major corporations.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So the actual government was
just the protection factor

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of having these places being
protected by the military

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
so all these secrets can
be kept really secret.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
So these are bases within bases.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And they go very,
very deep underground.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:10%
And there's a huge
connecting system

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:10%
that connects a
lot of these bases

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:10%
together from you know, Groom
Lake to Alamogordo, Texas,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:10%
White Sands National Park there,
all the way up to Mountainair,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.682 align:middle line:10%
Cut over to Kirtland Air
Force Base, Albuquerque,

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico up to Dulce,
down to Crestone, and then

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:10%
from Crestone up to
Colorado Springs.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
Denver [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I know about all
those, been through all that.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And it led me, every
quarterly, you'd

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:10%
get a security upgrade if
you kept your mouth shut

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:10%
and you did the right thing.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:10%
So after doing this for a
while, after working on bodies,

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:10%
you know, first it was
just tissue samples,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:10%
then maybe you'd see an
arm or a hand or a finger.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it was like
a torso, and then full bodies.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
From there, the
biggest surprise to me

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
was that there was a craft that
was associated with a being

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted me to take a
tissue sample of the craft.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I was
very young at this age.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't as conscious
as I am now.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, you know,
like nuts and bolts and steel,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm going to
take a sample of what?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
A craft?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So they escorted me
to this huge hangar

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
that we had to take a maglev to.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened was there
was this giant craft there

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that was made out of
like a memory foam,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:90%
like a gelatinous thing.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And they brought me
up to the center of it

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and told me where
to take the sample.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And this craft was
completely alive.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed during
also on crash sites

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
where I was also
part of for forensics

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that the further you move the
being away from the craft,

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
the being starts to deteriorate.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:10%
The closer you can get
the being in the craft,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:10%
if it came out of the craft,
that the craft actually

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:10%
helps the being because they
have the exact same DNA.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:10%
So there's something going on
where they're forming craft

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:10%
in anti-gravity in space
through frequency and sound,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:10%
so, you know, sound before
form is what we say.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So they can make anything,
even, you know, genetically,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
with tissues and things
like this to have the craft.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And the best way
I could put this

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
while being in a lot
of these craft was it

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
really felt like I was like
standing next to my dog.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:90%
It was like this presence.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it did
connect to you consciously.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it didn't.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very nice feeling,
like a secure feeling I'll say,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
when your dog is next to
you cuddled up on your bed,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:90%
or your cat.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It was a very overwhelming
experience for me.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
So I took the samples.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not allowed really to
ask, where did you get this?

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to
ask what this is.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, I only get
to access a library.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:84%
We get credits for good
behavior and showing up

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
on time, which I'm not
really good at now.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, I'm going to-- it's
gone over a bit of time there.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> But that is so fascinating.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.414 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:49.107 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You'll get more time
to talk, because you've

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%
got a lot of questions here.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:90%
So next is Paola.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Harris.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know, you can
hear more tonight when you talk

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:10%
about this in detail.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.395 align:middle line:90%
You'll have to come see us.

00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:02.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, Steve,
thank you so much.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, I went
kicking and screaming

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:90%
into the paranormal.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, because
I remember when I

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
was working with Allen Heinich,
cause I met Allen by accident.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
My whole presentation is going
to be all the coincidences

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
of my life that started in 1979
after I saw "Close Encounters."

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think you pick this.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you pick
this kind of research

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:90%
because you want to do it.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that it was a process
of having an assignment which

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
we are completing, we
researchers are completing.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in my 70s.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So it took all of
these years for me

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to figure out why in the world
I was fascinated by this.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think we were all
given an assignment.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning, for
me, what was comfortable,

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
because Allen
Heinich, you know, he

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
coined the close encounters,
the first, second, third, and

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
fourth, third.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that, you know,
I thought, OK, if I could just

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
put pins in maps, I'm fine.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I was doing.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I was doing pins and maps.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I was doing nuts and bolts.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.437 align:middle line:84%
And I was scared to death
to know what was inside.

00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go there.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think a
lot of people resist this.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:90%
I know my family does.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about my
family, not talking about this

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
because they're scared.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, either you're interested
or you're not interested.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to encourage
everybody to understand,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:90%
this is not religion.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
They're either interested
or they're not.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:90%
You can't convert somebody.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I went
from putting pins

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:90%
in maps to looking at all of it.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know, Serena, you
said it is interplanetary,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And until I read Jacques
Vallee's "Forbidden Knowledge

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Volume 3 And 4," I didn't
know what was going on.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:10%
May I recommend those
books, my presentations

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:10%
around those books.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:10%
Because he basically spent his
whole life-- hes in his 80s

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:10%
now-- trying to figure this out.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And the person that really
talks about it most articulately

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:90%
is Grant Cameron.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.082 align:middle line:84%
I attended his
lecture yesterday.

00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:22.290 align:middle line:90%
I was blown out of the water.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't say it as
well as he does.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:90%
But he's got it.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
He's got the bottom line, which
I call the graduate school

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I started
in third grade.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping to stay in
graduate school for a while.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Because my chief motivation is
I want to know what's going on,

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
just like in "Close Encounters"
when Roy Neary says,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:90%
"tell me what's going on.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's going on."

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Francois Truffaut
turns around to everybody

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and says, "let him on
because they were invited."

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
These guys were invited.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:10%
So the paranormal, I think, is
the invitation for all of us

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.828 align:middle line:10%
to find out what's going on.

00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Paola.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.107 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:11.107 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Paola.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Grant Cameron.

00:19:12.757 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you, Paola.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll send you the check.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.916 align:middle line:10%
It was wonderful.

00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHING]

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.213 align:middle line:10%
People know my story.

00:19:19.213 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I started in nuts and bolts.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I had the sightings.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I chased the president.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I chased the head
scientist of the CIA.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:10%
Then I had sort of the
enlightenment experience

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:10%
in 2012 and sort of
fell off the edge

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:10%
of the earth for
the second time.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote a book
called "Inspired."

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:10%
So the sort of the
topic this morning

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.445 align:middle line:10%
is, is there an ET influence
on our evolution and stuff.

00:19:41.445 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book called
"Inspired" where I talked

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
about, it's not just ETs.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You'll have, I go
through 13 Nobel Prize

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
winners and artists and
musicians and stuff like that.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:10%
And my idea is that
there's a field.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're tapping
into the field.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.733 align:middle line:90%
And the ETs are in the field.

00:19:57.733 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:90%
The ghosts are in the field.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.673 align:middle line:84%
Your dead relatives
are in the field.

00:20:00.673 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in this field.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But you are going
into the field.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen
to Paola's story

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
about her encounter
with the being.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
You know that part.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.205 align:middle line:84%
But you have to know the part
where the phone is ringing,

00:20:11.205 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
where her phone keeps ringing,
this bizarre stuff that

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.288 align:middle line:90%
makes her go to do this.

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Or Linda, we were just
talking just before.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:10%
Linda has had this experience,
this oneness experience where

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:10%
people get into
the field and you

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:10%
realize it's more than
just somebody doing

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:10%
some sort of research.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So in tune with the
conversation this morning,

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:90%
are we being helped.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.133 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell your story,
because I like tell stories,

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're familiar with
the book that has just

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:90%
come out by Diana Pasulka.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.283 align:middle line:84%
She dedicates it to a guy
by the name of Tyler D.

00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And he's actually been
outed like a month ago.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
So his name is actually Tim.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:90%
I actually met this guy.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:10%
I had a couple of
conversations with this guy.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.347 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is,
are we being helped?

00:20:53.347 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you the
story that he told me

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
in 2013 in Pennsylvania.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He is a guy who sold a
company for big huge dollars.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:84%
He had an experiment
that he describes it

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in Diana Pasulka's
book, she describes it

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.983 align:middle line:84%
as he has this sort of idea
in his head and some memory.

00:21:11.983 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:90%
He describes it as a memory.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
The general says we want to put
something on the space shuttle.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking
for experiments.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.465 align:middle line:10%
And he says, well, I
think we should do this.

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:20.937 align:middle line:10%
And the general
says, that's crazy.

00:21:20.937 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:10%
It ain't gonna work.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:10%
You're not putting
that on space shuttle.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And he fights it.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And he finally gets a scientist
to sign off on this thing.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist
agrees to sign off.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they put it
on the space shuttle.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.867 align:middle line:10%
The conversation he had with
me was a little bit different

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:10%
than "it's a memory."

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
He was talking, because I
always do the download thing.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
40% of all experiencers
who answered

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the free survey of 6,000
experiencers answered

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the question, 40% said at one
point during their experience,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
they knew the answer to
everything in the universe.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.145 align:middle line:84%
25% said they knew the answer
to everything about themselves.

00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's over 60% had
this sort of enlightenment.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
42% say they know
mathematical, technical,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
or scientific material that
they did not learn in school.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So when Tim told
me the story, he

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
knew I was into
this download thing.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And he started
telling me the story.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.732 align:middle line:84%
But it was a little bit
different than it was a memory.

00:22:06.732 --> 00:22:09.532 align:middle line:84%
He told me the story
that, he said, you know,

00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
when I got that idea in my
head, and this is an idea,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
he sold this company
for huge money,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:90%
medical, technical company.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Grant, the last thing

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.385 align:middle line:84%
I remember before I
woke up in the morning

00:22:22.385 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
was a hooded figure standing
at the end of the bed.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, could
you see its face?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I
couldn't see its face.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:10%
And so this is the
whole deal is he always

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:10%
has known that there was
this sort of interaction

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:10%
that he was being helped.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And he has a protocol.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So his protocol is, you
go to bed for eight hours,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
you get up, you go back
to sleep for an hour.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
You get up you go
out into the sun,

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
you drink a huge glass of water.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:90%
He will not touch alcohol.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
He will not touch coffee.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And he says he
knows within minutes

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:90%
they're in contact with him.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And he's got 40 patents.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He says that he is actually
getting material from,

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.895 align:middle line:84%
I would say, from the
field, from these beings.

00:22:57.895 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:90%
He believes they're benign.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:90%
He believes they're helping us.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And he works with cancer
kids in LA and Florida.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And you hear his story
and you realize, yes, we

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.978 align:middle line:84%
are getting help from
somebody out there.

00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:13.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Grant.

00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I interviewed
Stuart Hameroff

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
who is a colleague
of Roger Penrose.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And they both have
come to the same place

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in their respective,
brilliant, genius careers.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
the discovery of tubules

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
in the human brain that now
appear to be directly related

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:90%
to frequency.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the tubules,
in a most recent article,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:84%
may actually be
sensitive to light.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that in
our entire brain mass

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is something that
is being discovered

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in history
and now is being studied.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would we have tubules
throughout our brain that

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
would have a very
specific interaction

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
with certain frequencies,
whether it is sound

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
or whether it is light?

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And as Grant and I
and others, I think

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
we've been evolving
to this concept

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that everything that I've
learned going from animal

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
mutilations to human abductions
to the government playing

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
really hard ball to
keep it covered up.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:90%
They have killed people.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And scientists do that.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they
are doing it anymore

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and that the influence of
frequencies on the human minds

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
sets up a kind of
bell-shaped curve,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that influence could be
everything from what Grant just

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
said, putting downloads
into a human mind

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to inspire
a scientific idea.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I once talked with
somebody who said Einstein

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:90%
might fall in that category.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:10%
And there has been
some effort on a planet

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:10%
that they are probably
responsible for setting

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:10%
in motion the standing
up of primates,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:10%
that the document that I was
shown at Kirtland Air Force

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Base April 9th, 1983 that said
extraterrestrial biological

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:10%
entities manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:10%
to create Homo Sapien.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
sentence that today I

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
encounter in almost
every discussion

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that I would have with
somebody who has had experience

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
on the military side or the
intel side with analyzing what

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
is this phenomenon.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we are made and
we have tubules, now,

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're discovering,
in our brain,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:84%
then the ability for
something that we still

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
haven't met and had
a handshake with,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
but that has the ability to
put numbers, formulas, images,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
geometries, fractals
in our minds

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is something that the government
of the United States, I know,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:90%
is afraid of.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:10%
And yet at the
same time, I think

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:10%
if we could know the
truth and understand

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:10%
in this panoply of all of
the different types that

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:10%
are described by people
in the abduction syndrome,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:10%
we might begin to be able
to separate out and say,

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:10%
if we learned how, if we
became conscious about how

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:10%
our minds could be
manipulated, then

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:10%
maybe there would be ways to
enhance that which is positive

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:10%
and block that
which is negative.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I was talking with
Grant about before we started

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
was the single most pivotal and
profound experience of my life.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I was 21 years old.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I was up in the
mountains of Idaho

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:90%
with my brother and a cousin.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And the reason we were there
was so I could climb a mountain

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:10%
because I was to be in
the Miss America Pageant

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.390 align:middle line:10%
in September of that
year and I wanted my body

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:10%
to be as strong and
healthy as possible.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.405 align:middle line:84%
So I had been going up and
down this mountain twice.

00:27:52.405 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And by that time,
it had probably

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
been eight or nine days.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was something I was
doing that would almost

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
fall into a routine.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
you're in a routine,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
it becomes like meditation,
whether you know it or not.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was the
cause, I ended up--

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot more, but
I'll just cut to this--

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
the entire world around me
turned into pulsing light.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:10%
And at first, I
wanted everything

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:10%
to go back to normal.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:10%
It's an odd reaction, because
it was so extraordinarily

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:10%
beautiful.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I started running
again on a path

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to make everything
go back to normal.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:10%
But instead of going back to
normal, everything everywhere,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:10%
the mountain, the stars
in the twilight sky,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:10%
everything began pulsing,
not just the ground.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:10%
And I found something
that felt like warm jello

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:10%
lifting up my hands
in front of me.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't lifting my
hands, it was something

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:90%
that felt like warm jello.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And my hands came up
in front of my face.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this thought
voice in my mind,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
you are one with the light.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:90%
The light is one with you.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And you are in the
hands of God forever.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the warm jello, it
seemed to let my hands go down.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I was looking at then
the world of light around me,

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:84%
it was as if, and now I
think about these tubules

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that they have found, it
was as if at that moment

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I went from one complex to
another in which photon light

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and sun from that time on
has been the ally of my life.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And you wish that you
could communicate this

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
to everybody on the planet.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is something that
even this morning as I'm

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.375 align:middle line:90%
telling you, I feel awkward.

00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I think you feel
that if you talk

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
about these experiences
that relate to frequencies

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and light, that somehow we
as a human species judge

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:90%
and dismiss.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And I guess
everything in my work

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:84%
now is that I
would like to reach

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
as many people as possible,
not about the UFO,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:90%
mechanical technology.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But that I really
think if we're going

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to survive on planet
Earth, everybody

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
has to have these
kinds of experiences.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
To get us out away from the
meat world into something

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.277 align:middle line:84%
where we will be
able to survive.

00:31:06.277 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Linda.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Rocket Man, David Adair.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Golly, where do I start?

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Just give you an
idea of how long--

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how long
I've been at this stuff.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But my first encounter,
whatever you want to say,

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:90%
occurred back in 1971.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was working.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:84%
When I was seven, quantum
physics, differential

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, that
wasn't even heard of.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I've been at this for 57 years.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't realize it.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I suddenly feel old.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.468 align:middle line:84%
The little girl, I fixed
her bicycle next door.

00:31:52.468 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:84%
She asked me how
old I was and I told

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:90%
her two days older than dirt.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I've been at this for a while.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Y'all are right about
the downloads, though.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
some substance to that.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:10%
You know, to be fair to
everybody in this room,

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:10%
and the question "I want
to know what's going on."

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, let me tell you
a couple of things.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:10%
I want you to consider this.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
The aliens that
come here and visit,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't always know
what they're doing.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:90%
They mess up.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They're under the same
Murphy's Law as we are.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Things bust, things
gets messed up.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
They lose their
charts, whatever.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:90%
They foul up.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.895 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
us, tampering with us,

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:84%
they didn't always know
what they were doing.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.298 align:middle line:10%
However, in those downloads, let
me share some things with you.

00:32:52.298 --> 00:32:54.590 align:middle line:10%
If you ever an alien race
you know what the first thing

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:10%
you should do?

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Reach in your pocket,
hopefully, you

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:10%
got some change, hand
the change to them?

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:10%
In a matter of seconds,
they'll look at it

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and go, wow, he
knows metallurgy.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
He has a government,
a base 10 system.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he believes in a god.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:90%
"In God we trust."

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
all of that's coming off
the change in seconds

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
You ever consider that?

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.272 align:middle line:90%
Don't run.

00:33:23.272 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They'll think you're a rabbit
and they'll probably eat you.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:10%
So stand still and
hand them the change.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's something else.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.510 align:middle line:84%
People have always
asked me, you know,

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:84%
when you stuck your hands on
that craft, what did you get?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I got way more
and I was asking for.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:10%
I didn't really was
expecting any of this.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:10%
But consider this.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
When a UFO comes in
and everybody thinks,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.980 align:middle line:90%
oh, they're light.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
push them around.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are light until
they shut their engines off.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Because when they shut they're
engines off completely,

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the material that the crafts
are made of are extremely heavy.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:10%
So they have to be careful where
they need to do maintenance.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:10%
And they have to do maintenance.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:10%
They just don't run forever.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:10%
They got to tune things up.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:10%
So when they sit down, you
know what they look for?

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:10%
Railroad tracks.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:10%
Do you want a diesel
locomotive weighs?

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:10%
575 tons.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:10%
So when they sit down, they
clamp down on these rails

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:10%
and turn their engines off.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:10%
Those rails are universal
wherever they go.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:10%
They know they can
take the weight.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.568 align:middle line:10%
But there's a second
reason why they're

00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:10%
clamping down on these
rails with the big clamps.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
All the rails are
continuously hooked together

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
from South America,
North America, Canada.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're using the rails as
a phase array radar antenna.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:10%
That's how they send
their signals back home.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:10%
You ever heard any
of this stuff before?

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:10%
I didn't think so.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.642 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.642 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And another thing they like.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:90%
They like jello.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
At least, this
particular race did.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:10%
And they don't have
gelatin on their planet.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had to ask
them, we like red.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:90%
They like green.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the color.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, don't make
the dangerous assumption

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that they know everything,
omni-knowledge, omni-presence,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.380 align:middle line:90%
they're not.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you another example.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Consider this.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You get a yahoo like
me on another planet.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I show you all
back in 1971, I

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.708 align:middle line:84%
created an entirely
new propulsion system.

00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:52.125 align:middle line:10%
Now, instead of fighting with
me, which they did, and they

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:54.755 align:middle line:10%
were fighting over like
scraps between dogs,

00:35:54.755 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:10%
if they had helped me,
I could have given you

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:10%
some really interesting
modes of travel at that time.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So we hop on board,
and we take off.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
We land on another
planet, because we can

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.180 align:middle line:90%
transfer vast distances now.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:90%
However, we still make mistakes.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So here, just because
they have landed

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.070 align:middle line:84%
some advanced craft doesn't
mean they're necessarily

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
advanced in their technological
or sociological thoughts.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And also consider this,
when a race sets down, grabs

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.980 align:middle line:84%
hold of somebody,
does experiments,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
does all kinds of things,
don't even ask you really,

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that's not very advanced because
they sure don't respect you

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.150 align:middle line:90%
as a sentient being.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:84%
They look more,
you know, they're

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at you with the same
way a doctor would look at a lab

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:90%
rabbit in a laboratory.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's not very
advanced, I don't think.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And what is their
prime directive?

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Which is something
Star Trek came up with.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's a really smart
idea, non-interference.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't interfere with a race.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't experiment on them.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You let it run its
own natural course

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
the right to do that.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So I may be bringing in
exact opposite thoughts

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:middle line:84%
than what you get
from my colleagues

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:90%
up here, which are fine.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Most of the stuff
they're saying is really

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.410 align:middle line:90%
quite fascinating and accurate.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:84%
But just don't make that
dangerous assumption

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:90%
that they know everything.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And they got Murphy Law up
their butt just as bad as we do.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:10%
So you know, they hate it when
that anti matter drive stops.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
God, I hate it
when that happens.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's some things I
want you to think about.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It's really, you know, still
dicey out there, what they're

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:90%
doing, what their goals are.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm from a more of a
disciplined approach looking

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.950 align:middle line:90%
at the problem.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to just
hand over and surrender

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.930 align:middle line:84%
my independent thoughts
simply because they showed up

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:90%
in a really neat spacecraft.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:90%
So think about that, you know.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you could imagine what
it's like if I meet an ET,

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I would have to sit there
and talk to him for a while

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:84%
before I tie a knot
in his long neck.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:10%
And here, believe me, I have
firsthand knowledge of stuff

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:10%
that you're all wanting
to know what's going on.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:10%
So the imperfectalities that we
have here, they're universal.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.733 align:middle line:84%
They're across all the planets
out there and all the races.

00:38:33.733 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:10%
The ones that simply
get here, they just

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.228 align:middle line:10%
got a better mode
of transportation.

00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean they have the
answers to all the other stuff.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know what
the answer is to that.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing here?

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Which way they want to go?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.695 align:middle line:10%
And you got multiple
people, multiple races,

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and they all got
multiple agendas.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:10%
And they have agendas, too.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.907 align:middle line:10%
They come all this way,
vast distances, you know.

00:38:58.907 --> 00:39:00.490 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
we heard of people

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:90%
abducted, taking samples?

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, they're
looking for something

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.840 align:middle line:10%
or they're planning to do
something or alter something.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, they have their
own agendas as well.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:10%
But just don't surrender
everything at once

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:10%
when you hear this.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, here they are.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.707 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily that way.

00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, David.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.680 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:84%
That makes me think
of a little story.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I also, you
know, talk about that

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:84%
when I give a talk about how
the ETs don't know everything,

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:90%
especially the gray ones.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
a true story

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:84%
of someone hiking
in the El Yunque

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Rainforest in Puerto Rico.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And he was hiking along a path.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And then a little ET was
coming the other direction.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And they both saw each other and
were both shocked and both ran

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.705 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:39:56.705 --> 00:39:57.505 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:39:57.505 --> 00:40:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So just now Stephen
Bassett got here.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for making it.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm so glad.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
give an introduction.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
He is the executive director
of the Paradigm Research

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Group dedicated to end the
government-imposed embargo

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.260 align:middle line:84%
on the truth behind
extraterrestrial-related

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
He organized a citizen's
hearing on disclosure

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
at the National
Press Club in 2013

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as two political
initiatives in Washington DC.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.716 align:middle line:90%
Let's welcome Stephen Bassett.

00:40:33.716 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:10%
If you want to say
just five minutes.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:84%
What we are talking about is,
are ETs helping us evolve?

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe are they helping us
get disclosure, possibly?

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.540 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, first I'd like to
apologize for being late,

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:10%
my colleagues, and
to the audience.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I had a really bad morning.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk about it.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But I do promise to attend
two "get your life together"

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.142 align:middle line:90%
lectures later today.

00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:04.974 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:41:04.974 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, only the ETs know
what they're going to do,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:84%
what they want to
do, and so forth.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have not had
any meetings, though I

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.365 align:middle line:90%
have sent many requests.

00:41:21.365 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:90%
But we have glimpses.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We have little bits of here,
there that we can surmise

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:90%
or project a little bit.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, being a new
ancient aliens alumnus,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I have to acknowledge that they
have been interacting with us

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:90%
for tens of thousands of years.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.058 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there is an
AlienCon coming up in June,

00:41:49.058 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
the fourth one from
"Ancient Aliens."

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So there will be about
20,000 people there

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.310 align:middle line:90%
at the LAX convention center.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk
about the modern era.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.990 align:middle line:84%
From the contactee reports,
over probably somewhere

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:84%
between maybe as many
as a million reports

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that are now accumulated
in the research,

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.390 align:middle line:90%
that's a lot of information.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Not all of it can be, obviously,
simply taken for granted.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's a bell curve
of accounts which coalesce.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And those accounts indicate
direct interactions,

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.110 align:middle line:84%
some people being taken
and being brought back,

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:90%
fortunately.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
asked questions.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:84%
They'll be asked, do
you believe in God?

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, yes.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:90%
They'll ask, is there a god?

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.220 align:middle line:90%
They'll say yes.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.818 align:middle line:84%
These are in the
contactee reports.

00:42:35.818 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean it's true?

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:84%
No, it could just be
they're humoring you.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.692 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, they took
you out of your bed.

00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
trying to be nice.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:90%
But we know that.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.566 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They give messages
to contactees--

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:84%
this is a standard thing,
[INAUDIBLE] reported it--

00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:00.140 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes after table
work or whatever.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They'll then take
you aside and they'll

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:90%
put messages into your head.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.275 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they project
them on the wall.

00:43:05.275 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The messages seem to
have some consistency.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:90%
You've all heard about this.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:16.663 align:middle line:84%
They show future,
bad situations.

00:43:16.663 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
they're actually

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:90%
showing them the future.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I'd never accepted that.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.945 align:middle line:84%
I think they're showing a
possible future, meaning this

00:43:23.945 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:90%
is what you guys are doing.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where it's going to
end up, giant pile of rubble,

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and so forth,
environmental degradation.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.505 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:43:30.505 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Why would they
bother to do that?

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And then they do other things.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.310 align:middle line:90%
They put crop circles.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.613 align:middle line:84%
You know, all respect
to the crop circle

00:43:39.613 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:84%
makers, wonderful
group of people,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:90%
whoever the hell they are.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But most of those crop circles
are extraterrestrial, trust me.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I've always known that.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And research has confirmed it.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Why do you put beautiful images
into the same fields every year

00:43:54.305 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
knowing that each
year people are

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
going to come back
with FLIR cameras

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and ultralight
airplanes and goggles?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
They hang out all night
trying to catch them.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're so nice.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.225 align:middle line:84%
And there's almost very
little crop that's lost.

00:44:08.225 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It seems like a nice thing.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And you can find
crop circle images

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.620 align:middle line:10%
on refrigerators in Moldavia.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:10%
People love them.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:10%
They put them up.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:84%
The cattle mutilation
thing, that's a little tough

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.310 align:middle line:90%
if you're a farmer.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a little
unpleasant, not that we

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
don't do that ourselves.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we kill a lot
more cattle on the planet

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:90%
than they do.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.565 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling the
government's been paying

00:44:33.565 --> 00:44:34.940 align:middle line:84%
the ranchers under
the table that

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.065 align:middle line:84%
lose these cattle so they'll
just be cool about it,

00:44:37.065 --> 00:44:39.420 align:middle line:90%
but I can't prove it.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, the most
important thing that I've seen,

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:90%
and I'll finish with this.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:84%
One the most important pieces
of evidence of this field

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:52.340 align:middle line:84%
ever is the good members of
the United States Air Force,

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
high security SAC base
officers who came forward--

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's many that haven't
yet, but they eventually will--

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.330 align:middle line:84%
confirming that they have
turned off our nuclear weapons

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.560 align:middle line:90%
on numerous times.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In Russia, I know I think Tom
DeLonge is saying that they do

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.510 align:middle line:90%
that here.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.103 align:middle line:84%
I disagree with him
on this, but I'm

00:45:10.103 --> 00:45:11.270 align:middle line:90%
welcome to see the evidence.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:90%
In Russia, they go further.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They turn the systems
on, maybe because they

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.990 align:middle line:84%
needed to send a stronger
message to the Soviet Union,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.790 align:middle line:90%
rather.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, everything is fine,
and suddenly the system

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.200 align:middle line:90%
is going to launch mode.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And you're going, who did that?

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.237 align:middle line:90%
Comrade, who did that?

00:45:28.237 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they try to stop
it, and it doesn't stop.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.945 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps going,
and it keeps going.

00:45:31.945 --> 00:45:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And it gets up to the point
of launch, and it turns off.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:90%
That'll get your attention.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And check on this.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.743 align:middle line:90%
You'll find this is true.

00:45:40.743 --> 00:45:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Tom says this happened here.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But over here they've turned
our weapons off plenty of times.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And we can turn them back on.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.520 align:middle line:90%
They don't melt them, right?

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Melt them down.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.560 align:middle line:90%
They turn them off.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:90%
We turn them on.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Most of the witnesses
I've talked to,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:84%
like Bob Sallis and others,
believe this is a message.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple message.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.560 align:middle line:90%
One, they're useless against us.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And two, why in the
hell do you have these?

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And so just from that,
the general sense

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.747 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying to influence
our behavior right now.

00:46:09.747 --> 00:46:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And they got serious about
it after we dropped those two

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.350 align:middle line:84%
atomic bombs on some
Japanese people back in '45,

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.790 align:middle line:90%
you may recall.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They turned up 14 months
later all over the world

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and in Roswell in July of '47.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So my perspective, which
could be completely wrong,

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is that whatever they've done
to us in ancient alien times--

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:90%
did I mentioned AlienCon?

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.140 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing
now is trying to help

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
us get through a particular
period that could go badly

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.710 align:middle line:84%
because they'd like us to
stick around for a while

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and possibly because they know
we need to have a disclosure

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:47.690 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.898 align:middle line:84%
They know that they need to
become fully acknowledged

00:46:49.898 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:84%
on the planet by
all people, which

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.680 align:middle line:84%
means nations and politicians
have got to acknowledge it,

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
otherwise people are
going to go, I don't know.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
principal influence

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:00.800 align:middle line:90%
that they're executing.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And the goal of
it is disclosure.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They're pushing us.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't want
us to talk about us,

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.890 align:middle line:84%
they could be a
lot more discreet.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.300 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly believe
that if we have disclosure,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
we finally have that
announcement worldwide,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that it won't be very long
before open contact will come.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
new ball game.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we can have another
interesting discussion.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.374 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:26.374 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:90%
So there is a question.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I like these questions.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's for anyone on the panel
or everyone on the panel.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Someone is asking, has
any member of the panel

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:40.880 align:middle line:84%
ever seen an alien
themselves in person?

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.382 align:middle line:90%
And what were the circumstances?

00:47:43.382 --> 00:47:44.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola Harris.

00:47:44.366 --> 00:47:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Paola Harris.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:46.334 align:middle line:90%
>> No, him.

00:47:46.334 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I should
comment on this.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.890 align:middle line:10%
I worked with
extraterrestrials side

00:47:54.890 --> 00:48:00.480 align:middle line:10%
by side in operating room
conditions in the facilities.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.000 align:middle line:10%
Some of the beings that
we were working on,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.550 align:middle line:10%
there were actually
beings there that

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:11.780 align:middle line:10%
would help us work on the
collecting of tissue samples

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.065 align:middle line:10%
and dissections or teaching
us about their species.

00:48:15.065 --> 00:48:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
thing about them

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:84%
was the language of telepathy
that we had to learn.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they can speak, but
it's usually not a normal thing.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The first time I saw a
live extraterrestrial,

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:84%
it was at a large board
meeting of about 25 scientists

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that were just discussing
some new things that

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:90%
were coming into the facility.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And they did warn
us there would be

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:50.540 align:middle line:84%
three live extraterrestrial
beings that will be helping us.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.190 align:middle line:84%
They have volunteered
to be here.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:58.220 align:middle line:10%
They were not
captured or tortured.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of extraterrestrial
stuff that comes to our planet

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is actually
intentionally crashed

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.200 align:middle line:84%
here to help us
evolve a little bit.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
beings on those things

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.870 align:middle line:90%
are programmed lifeforms.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:19.120 align:middle line:84%
They're not actually real live
beings with souls and spirits.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.150 align:middle line:84%
They might be a cybernetic
organisms and things like this.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, could you
just tell which type,

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.340 align:middle line:84%
what physical type you have
actually seen and the whole

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:27.400 align:middle line:90%
description?

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The ones I worked
with were very tall.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very
white, like albino.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They had very large almond eyes
twice the size of our eyes.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They were wider set
apart than our eyes.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:44.630 align:middle line:84%
They also had smaller
noses and smaller lips.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:84%
They were ectomorphic in
body somatotype, which

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:51.080 align:middle line:90%
means long, lean muscle, bone.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.560 align:middle line:90%
There was no big fat ones.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Hair?

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Some had hair and
some did not have hair.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The hair was more like a kind
of the dreadlock type of hair.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a skin than
like a fur or soft hair

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:90%
like we have.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
best description.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:10%
They were always taller than me.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they had a great
sense of humor.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
experiences I had working

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.960 align:middle line:84%
across the table from one of
them, my first time assisting

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:37.040 align:middle line:84%
one, you have to really go into
this when you're meeting them,

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.790 align:middle line:90%
you have to ground yourself.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have a lot
of emotion on board.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you just got out of
a fight with your spouse

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're angry inside
and you're hiding it

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and you walk in
and you transmit,

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.440 align:middle line:90%
hello, it's like, hello!

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.450 align:middle line:90%
So they pick up on the emotion.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:01.535 align:middle line:84%
Because telepathy is
not something that you--

00:51:01.535 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:90%
you're not hearing like a voice.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It's you already
know what they said.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from the
emotion, from the heart.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we're working together,
it's so fast, the transmission,

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I already know he needs this.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
He already knows I need
this and he hands it to me.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- it's flawless.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And one funny
thing that happened

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:90%
is, they know everything.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%
So there is no--

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.010 align:middle line:84%
you cannot deceive or
have deception with

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.190 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials I'm
talking about, this race.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.600 align:middle line:90%
They know everything about you.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know
everything about them.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:84%
They have some sort of way
to kind of block that part.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But one of the funny things
was after a day on Friday

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
when I was leaving work
and we were finishing up

00:51:53.990 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
on the specimen, it was like,
oh, have a great weekend.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was, like,
uh-oh, oh, he knows.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.910 align:middle line:90%
He knows about my hot date.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:90%
That's not cool.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know, so
they're very comical.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're just like us,
they have personalities.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Some are more stern than others.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, the reptilian race
is very, very stern.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And they don't joke
around too much.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But they're very
advanced in technology.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.227 align:middle line:84%
So I've met many
different races.

00:52:36.227 --> 00:52:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
ones that I actually

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:41.130 align:middle line:84%
saw on a weekly basis that
were there in the facility.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't every day I got
to work with them, by the way.

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:47.560 align:middle line:10%
It was just on special
details and special projects

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:52.290 align:middle line:10%
where they wanted me to assist.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I was really good with
telepathy and remote viewing.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was a few
of the technicians

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in there like myself, that
were really good with this

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.890 align:middle line:90%
that could really stay focused.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's like a meditative, you
got to be in a meditative state

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:07.630 align:middle line:10%
as you're working.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't be
thinking about other things.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:15.633 align:middle line:84%
Because they pick up on, you
know, you thinking about, hey,

00:53:15.633 --> 00:53:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to get home
and ride my motorcycle down

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.100 align:middle line:90%
the mountain.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.535 align:middle line:84%
You know, because I was
a young kid at the time.

00:53:21.535 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So you're like, you're
focused, you're there.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They know everything,
which was kind of nice.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a really humbling
experience to be around them.

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, it was a very
calm and beautiful feeling.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they were
controlling my emotions.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It was just very calm.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- you're very
focused, you're calm,

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and you're happy.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a very happy feeling
that they give you.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, do you mean that there
were live tall whites and dead

00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.620 align:middle line:90%
tall whites?

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:03.955 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was it that
killed the tall whites?

00:54:03.955 --> 00:54:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to ask where
are the specimens come from

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:12.090 align:middle line:90%
or where the craft come from.

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very compartmentalized.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The only reason they
would bring me to a craft,

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:20.560 align:middle line:84%
if there was a specimen that
I collected some DNA from

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and they suspected it
was from this craft, then

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:27.490 align:middle line:84%
they would take me to the craft
to collect more specimens.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So they would do
the DNA testing.

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I was
just a technician,

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, following orders
and we weren't allowed

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to really know too much.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I got
privy to a lot more.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they hired
me to do the crash sites

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because not only
was I taking samples

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:48.190 align:middle line:84%
from craft and
from other beings,

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.440 align:middle line:84%
but I was taking
also from equipment

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.970 align:middle line:90%
that they found on the craft.

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.090 align:middle line:10%
So the craft themselves
with devices and things

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:58.270 align:middle line:10%
like this where we're taking
scrapings and things like this

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:03.130 align:middle line:10%
and seeing what types of
material they were made out of.

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Some craft had flora on it.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So there was also
animals as well, pets.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Dead or alive?

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Both dead and alive.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mutilated?

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.850 align:middle line:84%
No I'm talking about
crash sites right now

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.200 align:middle line:84%
where we would find
things bag them

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and tag them in these big
giant vacutainers, huge.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.220 align:middle line:90%
They look like a big capsule.

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Some we can add different
gases and different atmospheres

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.693 align:middle line:84%
into this to mimic, you
know, the atmosphere

00:55:35.693 --> 00:55:36.610 align:middle line:90%
that was on the craft.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Different beings, there are
so many different beings,

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:42.430 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's just
like on our planet

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
races on our planet.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So think like
interstellar-wise, just

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.620 align:middle line:84%
think everyone else
mingling together

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and how many different
races there are.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:02.260 align:middle line:10%
And the different types of looks
and the way their bodies are.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They all do have like a
head two arms and two legs

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:84%
like the five-pointed
star system, what

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.510 align:middle line:90%
we refer ourselves to.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:14.620 align:middle line:84%
There are a few of them that
are gelatinous that do not

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.030 align:middle line:84%
have shape, but
they can actually

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.790 align:middle line:84%
morph into almost
any shape they want.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So they can be made to
look like something.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They have great cloaking
abilities, like the higher

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.650 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional ones.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I was listening
to Adair just now,

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like there's
many levels, too.

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Like he said, they
don't know everything.

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's extraterrestrials
out there, guys,

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.867 align:middle line:84%
that are just a few thousand
years more advanced than us.

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
extraterrestrials out there

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:50.830 align:middle line:10%
that are actually like a billion
years more advanced than us,

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.220 align:middle line:10%
that they already can turn
into a light formation,

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:10%
a light body.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.920 align:middle line:90%
They can turn into anything.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They're transdimensional,
interdimensional.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were once
us, I believe.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:10%
Because out of all the DNA
samples that we have tested

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.780 align:middle line:10%
were some of them I was privy
to get to see the results,

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.510 align:middle line:10%
they all had human DNA.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:10%
There was a little bit
of human DNA in them.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.460 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of questions I get
is like, Emery, are you an ET?

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, we're all ETs.

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.600 align:middle line:90%
But we're all--

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, I will just let
everyone know that you're going

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to do your workshop
at 4:00 today.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can hear about
this and much, much more.

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Because he's going
to talk about how

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.385 align:middle line:84%
it was to work in
the underground base.

00:57:37.385 --> 00:57:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I'm going to
be interviewing him on these

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.930 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And they are so interesting.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
latest information.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola, do you want to talk
about your encounter with

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.330 align:middle line:90%
an ET?

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.742 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very meaningful.

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:58.605 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's very hard.

00:57:58.605 --> 00:57:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, can I just
say something?

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:04.210 align:middle line:10%
I got a message from the
being that Paola actually

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.260 align:middle line:10%
interacted twice.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.020 align:middle line:10%
I had a message, two times I
had a message from a being.

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:10%
One ended up being
the book "Tuned In--

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:12.220 align:middle line:10%
The Paranormal World of
Music" about the fact

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.750 align:middle line:10%
there are messages in music.

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.243 align:middle line:10%
But the second one came from a
being by the name of Antarel.

00:58:17.243 --> 00:58:19.660 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I was sort of
going there was because Paola

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.500 align:middle line:10%
had had this event.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.810 align:middle line:10%
So Paula can tell you,
she actually encountered,

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:27.020 align:middle line:10%
I had a message from the same
being that she encountered.

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
how this happened.

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not something
I really wanted to do.

00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm pretty
nuts and bolts.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to stay
in the stable world.

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But I began researching
human-type aliens

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.890 align:middle line:84%
because I have a bias that
the UFO community has shoved

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.800 align:middle line:84%
the ETs into reptilians,
Nordics, and greys,

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and this is totally ignorant.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are, as
Emery mentioned,

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.300 align:middle line:90%
different kinds [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't shove it into
any of those three boxes.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to make
these judgments, which

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:06.710 align:middle line:90%
are ridiculous.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to
the giant rock days.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my presentation.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the 1950s,
Adamski, Menger, Van Tassel,

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and I went there.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I got the survivors
of those days.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that these space
people that came to this earth

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:28.570 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s, '60s, including
Eugenio Siragusa in Italy,

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:31.360 align:middle line:90%
were people.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:35.620 align:middle line:10%
Our field is gray aliens.

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in
the 1950s, and I'm

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:41.170 align:middle line:84%
very emotional about this,
was these people coming off

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.870 align:middle line:84%
spaceships giving
us direct messages

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and they lived somewhere else.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Because, as Monsignor
Balducci told me,

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:52.030 align:middle line:84%
God created people all over
the place, which is logical.

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Why would create
people only here?

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is this,
that I started doing that.

00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
these people from the 1950s

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.430 align:middle line:84%
went away because as they
land in this country,

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:07.008 align:middle line:84%
all that they're interested
in is the propulsion system.

01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:08.800 align:middle line:10%
You go up and say, how
does the craft work?

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.960 align:middle line:10%
And that's all everybody
is interested in.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.890 align:middle line:10%
I found out that in the
1970s with Sixto Paz

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Wells and his brother Charlie,
all those people in Peru

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.690 align:middle line:10%
were meeting with space people.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:23.650 align:middle line:90%
So I had to go to South America.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And I started interviewing
all of the South American

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
contactees from the 1970s,
who Grant has already

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:31.480 align:middle line:90%
talked to also.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are
you guys kidding?

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.840 align:middle line:90%
You went out into the desert?

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
You did automatic writing?

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.492 align:middle line:84%
You guys were meditating,
and the ETs told you

01:00:38.492 --> 01:00:39.700 align:middle line:90%
when they were going to land?

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.450 align:middle line:90%
They said, yes.

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
South Americans go up

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and say, where is your
propulsion system?

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.490 align:middle line:90%
How does your craft to work?

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.630 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, hi, how are you?

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:52.970 align:middle line:90%
That's where they went.

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And so during all
my interviews, which

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
are in the back of my book,
"All the Above-- and Beyond."

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard because
I don't speak Spanish.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was with a Spanish
interpreter the whole time.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I got to learn about
a contactee named

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo Gonzales who
is from Lima, Peru

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.450 align:middle line:90%
but lives in Argentina.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And Ricardo travels the world.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.640 align:middle line:10%
Because he was told
to adhere to the idea

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.025 align:middle line:10%
that we need to come together
for world peace or nobody

01:01:19.025 --> 01:01:21.140 align:middle line:10%
is ever going to talk to us.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So Ricardo from ALTAI, from
Asia, from ALTAI in Mongolia

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
writes me and says,
my contact, and he's

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
had eight meetings
with Antarel--

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
my contact Antarel
wants to meet you.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.420 align:middle line:10%
And I thought he just
wanted publicity,

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.350 align:middle line:10%
so I said, no, I don't want
to really go to Shasta.

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It was Mt.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It was camping for three days.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it
was also fasting.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So thank god I brought an
apple, I cut it in 16 pieces

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and tried to last
for those days.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.008 align:middle line:90%
Froze to death.

01:01:54.008 --> 01:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
the language.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't understand Spanish.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's all in Spanish.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And he does it every year.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So I said no three
times, until he

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
called me from Malaga in Spain
and said Paola, Antarel wants

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.520 align:middle line:90%
to meet you.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
you know, this is--

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And he says, we'll arrange it.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.590 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you the tent.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:13.448 align:middle line:90%
We'll pick you up.

01:02:13.448 --> 01:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll take care of
it and everything.

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:17.090 align:middle line:90%
So I went for curiosity.

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And the secret is to
say yes to these things.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Because I say no all the time.

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I was there for three days.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
With Ricardo Gonzales,
it's programmed sightings.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
He knows the exact time they
fly over because they tell him.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:41.981 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing was this,
that they flew over at 8:35,

01:02:41.981 --> 01:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
then Antarel would be
in the forest in Shasta.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.777 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
Sunday, the last night.

01:02:46.777 --> 01:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But all I could think about
was freezing to death,

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
getting out of there,
and I was starving.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.780 align:middle line:10%
So I couldn't wait
till it was over.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.850 align:middle line:10%
I saw the fly over at 8:35.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.320 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't believe anything.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So I just said I hope this is
over soon because I'm cold.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.370 align:middle line:10%
And he knelt down in front of
me, came over to me and said,

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:05.780 align:middle line:10%
Antarel is in the forest.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle it?

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.350 align:middle line:90%


01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a split second yes
or no, a split second.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.753 align:middle line:10%
And he said there are
two women that are

01:03:14.753 --> 01:03:15.920 align:middle line:10%
going to walk down with you.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.990 align:middle line:90%
You hold hands.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
He's standing next to a tree.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo said, I
can't go with you.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.800 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't want me
there, he just wants you.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like,
I get emotional.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Because he did the video.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Because it was scary.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, so I held hands
with Mercedes and Suyapa.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Sol and my interpreter
were down there already.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I walked down there
and I'm within,

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many feet of the man

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:50.840 align:middle line:84%
that's standing next to a
tree that's 10 foot tall.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
He had a hoodie on, actually.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He looked like he just
came out of a gym.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
He had a hoodie on
with space boots.

01:03:56.870 --> 01:04:00.808 align:middle line:84%
And you know, like,
he had a spacesuit.

01:04:00.808 --> 01:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
But he had the hoodie on.

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%
I could see his long, long face.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
He had a long face and
almond-shaped eyes.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And he was standing there.

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And the scariest part
is, Ricardo told me

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
when I got down there, let go
of their hands, the other two

01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:17.210 align:middle line:90%
women.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to
have separate experiences.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.440 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.523 align:middle line:84%
And that was the scariest
part of the whole thing.

01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as I'm holding
on to somebody, I'm OK.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But when I got down
there, I let go.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I did not know what to do.

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:33.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing there.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.900 align:middle line:90%
There's no protocol for this.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I just stood and stared at him.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.640 align:middle line:84%
He was standing by the
tree with his hands down.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was speaking a language
I didn't understand at all.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
So I thought this is in Spanish.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going on here.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
What is he saying?

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And I had no protocol.

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:56.120 align:middle line:10%
So I just bent my head and
said, I respect you, Antarel.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.450 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't say-- I didn't--
because that is not like

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.060 align:middle line:10%
anybody, I mean, that I know.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So at the very-- he's three
minutes of this language.

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like an echo
through the whole forest.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It sounded like a bullhorn.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end
of the three minutes

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
in a robotic voice like a
robot, he said "thank you."

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:24.870 align:middle line:10%
He turns around and he
walks back into the forest.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
So did that happen?

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Do I have post-traumatic stress?

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:32.913 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.913 --> 01:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what happened.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.053 align:middle line:84%
When I ran back to Ricardo,
he said, what happened?

01:05:37.053 --> 01:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, I think
he said thank you,

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.637 align:middle line:90%
but I think I'm going crazy.

01:05:39.637 --> 01:05:43.450 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So because I had been doing all
the work on human-type aliens,

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
this is an Apunian.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The basin is in
Huascaran in the Andes.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The whole story of the
Apunians, this kind of race,

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is captured in a book
called "Contact from Apu."

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
My experience and
Ricardo's experience

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
with this particular race that
has been helping the peasants

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes for
years, has been talking

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.910 align:middle line:90%
to the farmers in the Andes.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:13.038 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
come to the government.

01:06:13.038 --> 01:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They've been helping heal
children and everything

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
in Peru.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:middle line:90%
This is Peru.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Huascaran is the
mountain in the Andes.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on my way there in May
to that base, to that mountain.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to do
a documentary on this.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't the grey, and the
Nordics, or the reptilians.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.450 align:middle line:90%
These are particular races.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard for
me to talk about it.

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola, we want [INAUDIBLE]----
you thank you, Paola.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I just add just a
30-second support to this.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I was with Paola at Mt.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
She had two experiences
two years in a row,

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.080 align:middle line:90%
was petrified both times.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But Paola took me around
to all the people.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
She said all the
rest of the people,

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.825 align:middle line:84%
there were seven
people in this xendra.

01:06:56.825 --> 01:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
We call them portals.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They call them xendras.

01:06:58.770 --> 01:06:59.540 align:middle line:90%
There were seven people.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.582 align:middle line:84%
We went around and we
interviewed all the people.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:03.212 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so what did you see?

01:07:03.212 --> 01:07:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it was this
guy standing there.

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
He was about 10 feet tall,
had sparks coming off

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:09.035 align:middle line:84%
his chest, the same,
exactly the same story.

01:07:09.035 --> 01:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It was like they were
reading off a cue card.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the one guy we
were interviewing, and I said,

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:14.550 align:middle line:90%
were you scared like Paola?

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:15.350 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
He was one of the ones with--

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Raymundo.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Raymundo, he went,
they found the xendra.

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
There were six people that
actually had automatic writing.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
That a couple days
before had actually

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.440 align:middle line:90%
said that the xendra would open.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why they went into the
forest looking for the xendra,

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
for this portal, because
they had these messages.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:35.860 align:middle line:90%
But we went around.

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.565 align:middle line:84%
I remember Raymundo,
I said to him,

01:07:37.565 --> 01:07:38.690 align:middle line:90%
were you scared like Paola?

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:40.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, not really.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so you've
seen him before?

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, I've seen him.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, how many times
have you seen him?

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:45.523 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, five or six times.

01:07:45.523 --> 01:07:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't keep count.

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of
follow them around.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.087 align:middle line:84%
So this is an event that I was
sort of involved in as well.

01:07:51.087 --> 01:07:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get the xendra, but
I had a programmed sighting

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.545 align:middle line:90%
that happened over my head.

01:07:54.545 --> 01:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But it is fascinating
when you get in there

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and then you talk to the people.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And these are all people
like our gardeners,

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are just
ordinary Latino people who

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.520 align:middle line:90%
come to meditate on Mt.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Shasta to save the world.

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:08.432 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking like where
are the white American guys?

01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're
destroying the world.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.515 align:middle line:84%
And these Latino
people are coming here

01:08:11.515 --> 01:08:13.002 align:middle line:90%
to meditate for world peace.

01:08:13.002 --> 01:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was a fascinating
thing to actually have

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.944 align:middle line:90%
all these people.

01:08:15.944 --> 01:08:17.569 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not
a one-person event.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:22.619 align:middle line:84%
This was seven people in each
event that saw this being.

01:08:22.619 --> 01:08:23.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:08:23.419 --> 01:08:24.219 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:24.219 --> 01:08:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Paola is going to speak next.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:30.649 align:middle line:84%
Paola is going to have her
workshop at noon and in Los

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Angeles A room.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.359 align:middle line:84%
So after this it's
really great if you

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.180 align:middle line:90%
could go there and learn more.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.609 align:middle line:90%
There's a question for Linda.

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's
a cover up of how much

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
we can develop as humans
and if we can become more

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
powerful than we really are?

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's being
covered up on this planet?

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a really
good question, actually.

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:59.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole conflict of
various intelligences, when

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
you get to talk with people
who have had interactions

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.399 align:middle line:84%
either with entities
or they've been

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.189 align:middle line:84%
assigned to go to different
parts of the world

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:17.300 align:middle line:84%
in a military unit or
something, the one thing that

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.069 align:middle line:84%
is a common denominator to
it all seems always to be,

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
as a Navy SEAL said
to me, I had to fight

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
as if I were fighting for my
life to hold my mind intact.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.029 align:middle line:90%


01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Humans, Homo sapien
sapien, we haven't been

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.229 align:middle line:90%
built for telepathic downloads.

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was one incident
where a man was in the Air Force

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:51.580 align:middle line:90%
and had to fly to Arizona.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.819 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
telling you this

01:09:53.819 --> 01:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is the question implies, is
it in the vested interests

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
of any of the non-humans
to see us evolve?

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And most people in military,
anyway, in their exposures,

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
one here in a second,

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
they think that it is in the
interest of the non-humans

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to keep us dumb and blind
about what's happening.

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And the majority
of people that I

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
have been able to talk to
on or off the record who

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
have had some sort of
interaction with beings

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
describe the whole experience
as our minds are not

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
ready to take a
telepathic download

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and that our existence and
our relationship to them, then

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
must always be disconnected
and quite strange.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to tell you
about this one Air Force guy.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
He got a call that
they were gathering

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
at a place, a village
in northern Arizona.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was 1974 as I recall.

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And when he got there, they had
quite a military contingency.

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And his superior officer
came to him and said,

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
we want to try to find out
why blond Nordics destroyed

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
a bridge here and
flooded the village.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And we are trying to call in
the Ebens, the pear-headed ones.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They were being used to
communicate with the blondes.

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said as an
assignment, I want

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
you to experience what it
is like to have a download.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We have one of the Eben beings
here, and they have agreed.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And the superior officer
said to this Air Force

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
guy who is telling
me this story,

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come
from that tent flap.

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Walk and stay on the ground.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
They prefer to float, some
anti-gravity technology

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.080 align:middle line:90%
that they use.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.360 align:middle line:90%
But he will stay on the ground.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You will find it looks like
Donald Duck in an old cartoon.

01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And you will want to laugh
until it gets up to about 10

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.430 align:middle line:90%
to 12 feet from you.

01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you will feel like when
we do flame thrower exercises.

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is going
to want to retreat, run.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And this man, tall,
big, strong, said

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
he felt like they were
treating him like a child.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I can handle this.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything that the superior
officer said happened.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But when the being got
up to about 10 feet,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
he said my whole body
began to tremble.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I became
embarrassed because I

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
knew that my superior officer
and everybody was watching.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
As my body was
beginning to tremble,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
the being raised his head.

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And when their
eyes connected, he

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
said, with mine,
it was all over.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this
description before,

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that he said it would
be like seven movies

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
from Hollywood going
through your mind

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
all at the same time with
gold symbols superimposed

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
over all of the movies and that
he was feeling temperature.

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:42.710 align:middle line:90%
He was feeling touch.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.740 align:middle line:90%
He was feeling everything.

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a big, huge,
booming thing in his head.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said he began to
realize that his own mind was

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:54.290 align:middle line:90%
trying to ask questions.

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was the questions
that were sending off

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.540 align:middle line:90%
all of the new films.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And then he collapsed.

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The military were
standing behind him.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:09.740 align:middle line:90%
They took him.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
He woke up about three to four
hours later on a stretcher.

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
He said if God asked me
himself what was communicated,

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell you.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said we all
would like to sit down

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
in Starbucks with
an extraterrestrial

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and learn about the universe.

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't going to happen.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an
insight that I give you

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
about how complicated
communication is

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
if we are noisy
and verbal and we

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with civilizations
that are rapid image math

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.690 align:middle line:90%
minds telepathically.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you start there,
your question, the interface,

01:14:56.110 --> 01:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
if they made us,
they know everything

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.470 align:middle line:90%
about how we are wired.

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that if we're going
to end up ever in a peer ship,

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that we either have to
become more telepathic

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
or they have to be able to
come up with the technology

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that they could translate to us.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is one of
the biggest disconnects.

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I have heard that during
the Truman administration

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.090 align:middle line:90%
that they had a live non-human.

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And in order to communicate
with scientists,

01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
they had to put on
a shirt and a tie

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
sit it at a table

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and then see around the table
which scientist could take

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:46.200 align:middle line:90%
a telepathic download repeated.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And they said that out of
the 10 or 12 scientists that

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
were at this table with
one of the grey-type Ebens,

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
there was not a single scientist
who could get the download

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
correctly.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.500 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge gulf.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.090 align:middle line:90%


01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually we do
know someone who can.

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
David Adair, I think when
you were in the UFO engine,

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.540 align:middle line:90%
it contacted you.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So I've always wanted to
ask you this question.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Did the UFO engine, when
it was giving you messages,

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
did it give you strong
messages telepathically

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:29.960 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't spoken about?

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.005 align:middle line:90%
Or does it still do that?

01:16:34.005 --> 01:16:34.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

01:16:34.805 --> 01:16:37.940 align:middle line:90%


01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.325 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does, continuously.

01:16:40.325 --> 01:16:41.570 align:middle line:90%
It never stops.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:45.330 align:middle line:90%


01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The download, or transfer
is what it actually really

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
was, it came with so
many things added to it.

01:16:58.050 --> 01:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most difficult
things you had to put up with

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
is that it's uncomfortable.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It's searing.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.610 align:middle line:90%
It's hot going into your brain.

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:14.735 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, we're
not built for downloads.

01:17:14.735 --> 01:17:17.700 align:middle line:90%
We're really not.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned
I was going to leak.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Brain just can't
handle all of it.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But what surprised me was the
emotions that came with it.

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:33.530 align:middle line:90%
It was really unexpected.

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, seeing images
of stuff going by so fast,

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
but what you really
are communicating with

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:45.170 align:middle line:90%
is not your thoughts.

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
You're using your
emotions to communicate.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because your range of emotions
is really much broader

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:56.570 align:middle line:90%
than oral speech, way more.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:03.080 align:middle line:10%
And I remember sitting there
going through everything from--

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.760 align:middle line:10%
I thought if I was on the stage,
doing an ad lib or a prompt,

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.580 align:middle line:10%
man, I would really
score an A on this.

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll go from laughing
to crying to anger to fear

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:18.810 align:middle line:90%
to just as fast as it can go.

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to control
it, and you forget that.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But the history that came
through this thing was amazing.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind, this
is not a space craft.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not an alien
I'm dealing with.

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It is a power plant, OK?

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's an engine.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.422 align:middle line:90%
But it is a sentient.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.830 align:middle line:90%
It's as aware as you me.

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:50.222 align:middle line:90%
And it had history.

01:18:50.222 --> 01:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have
thought a power

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.230 align:middle line:84%
plant would have so much
history of interactions.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But the way the thing was built,
it functions very similar to--

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Navy for 11 years.

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And one time we
pulled up to Beirut,

01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and Beirut was so destroyed.

01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I was on a carrier, the Nimitz.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And we ran these big power
cables, lord, mercy, you know,

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.480 align:middle line:90%
this big around.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Ran them into the city, right
into their power plants.

01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And the nuclear
reactors on the carrier

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:27.890 align:middle line:84%
powered the city for
almost a year we sat there.

01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
This thing could
do the same thing.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.550 align:middle line:90%
The big craft would land.

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
This power plant can be
ejected out of the ship.

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.420 align:middle line:10%
And then it's a
power system that

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:43.850 align:middle line:10%
could run an entire world
is how much power it has.

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Millennials don't like long
terms, technical terms.

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have been asked,
what kind of device is it?

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's an electromagnetic
fusion containment system.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.950 align:middle line:10%
And they're looking
at me kind of blank.

01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
But they came up with a phrase.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.510 align:middle line:90%
This is so brilliant.

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have done any better.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
They went, oh, you
got a star in a jar.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went, that's
exactly right.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.420 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You have the power
of the sun harnessed

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
inside the
electromagnetic fields.

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:23.150 align:middle line:10%
So this power plant
has been everywhere,

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:25.310 align:middle line:10%
thousands and
thousands of worlds,

01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:27.290 align:middle line:10%
so many I couldn't even count.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And they had help.

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
going on out there.

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions
enlightened me to it.

01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
They were in conflict.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
There was some kind
of war, I guess.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's really old, an old war.

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And they don't come
from any planets.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They come from
between the galaxies.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
What everybody considers
dark matter, it is not.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's far from dark.

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
There are solar systems
in between the galaxies.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
We never thought there
was such a thing.

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%
I knew about it in 1971.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Hubble finally got
out in the space shuttles,

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
we detected some
disturbance out there,

01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
found out there are solar
systems between the galaxies.

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's rare.

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
spaced out far.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.660 align:middle line:90%
But this thing was right.

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%


01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this thing had a very
precise goal, a very specific

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.425 align:middle line:90%
thing it was looking for.

01:21:39.425 --> 01:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was good
because I really

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
hate to see what the broad
range would look like.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But it has been a
presence in my life.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, 10 years before this
from age seven to 17,

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I was doing OK with myself
as far as science goes.

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I was working on stuff people
didn't even know what it was.

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I have had to order
special books to find it.

01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But I was a little bit
ahead of a few things.

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:21.140 align:middle line:10%
But after this thing did
what it wanted to do,

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:24.620 align:middle line:10%
it has directed a lot
of things in my life.

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.920 align:middle line:90%
And the story hasn't ended.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
As you know, y'all are the
first to hear about it.

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I haven't told it.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.217 align:middle line:84%
George asked me yesterday
if it's OK to talk about it.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And I had to think for a second.

01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:40.580 align:middle line:10%
I went, yeah, it's OK.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:44.900 align:middle line:10%
I'll be going to
Cairo to live forever.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll be running the space
programs out of there.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.135 align:middle line:90%
So that's going to be--

01:22:51.135 --> 01:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I got offered the
position and I took it.

01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:00.360 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know, you might
have heard George say yesterday,

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.670 align:middle line:10%
and it's true, two days
ago Israel launched a pod

01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:06.200 align:middle line:10%
to the moon.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going
to land on the moon.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.455 align:middle line:90%
And they did it for two reasons.

01:23:10.455 --> 01:23:11.830 align:middle line:84%
One, they want
the Apollo effect.

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Everybody will get
interested in the moon.

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And second, to prove
that a small company

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
could get a probe to the
moon, which they proved it.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
However, the very first
thing I'll be doing,

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
we're going back
to the moon, y'all.

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going for a couple
of reasons like them,

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:31.500 align:middle line:90%
but a little bit different.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.440 align:middle line:10%
One is, I want to
land at the sites

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.250 align:middle line:10%
that this conspiracy tapes have.

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, Nazi emblem up on
the moon, that's pretty cool.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what that stuff is.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I haven't a clue.

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the tower and
the big arch and all that.

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:51.260 align:middle line:90%
That's worth looking at.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.340 align:middle line:90%
It warrants a serious look.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.960 align:middle line:10%
And you mentioned
crop circles, that's

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.580 align:middle line:10%
another thing that should
be seriously investigated

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.930 align:middle line:10%
and not just kind
of dusted over.

01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:07.280 align:middle line:10%
Cause that's not the
Doug and Dave show.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
definitely something

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
beyond our intelligence.

01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:16.550 align:middle line:10%
You know, maybe it's teenagers,
you know, from another world

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:18.430 align:middle line:10%
coming and doing graffiti there.

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:19.760 align:middle line:10%
We'll mess these humans up.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.470 align:middle line:10%
Let's draw this and
watch what happens.

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:23.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But it should be really
investigated seriously,

01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:27.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a loss.

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The other reason I'm going
is I'm after helium-3.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And look at the people who I
joined up with, powerbrokers.

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not crazy about oil.

01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:42.115 align:middle line:90%
They can't drink the stuff.

01:24:42.115 --> 01:24:43.700 align:middle line:90%
It'll kill them, right?

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.562 align:middle line:10%
So they don't like oil as much
you, but they're power brokers.

01:24:47.562 --> 01:24:49.520 align:middle line:10%
They don't care where
the power comes from long

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.860 align:middle line:10%
as they don't kill us all.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, the fossil fuel
is not very healthy.

01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So they're looking for
another power system--

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.400 align:middle line:10%
helium-3.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.280 align:middle line:90%


01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.360 align:middle line:90%
You hear that term.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.070 align:middle line:10%
Do you really understand
what helium-3 is?

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.870 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:08.510 align:middle line:10%
OK, look, I'm not going to
continue the darkness for you.

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.280 align:middle line:10%
It's an isotope of helium.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.620 align:middle line:10%
We have helium-2 on our planet.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:16.880 align:middle line:10%
But it's manufactured in
the surface of the sun.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:21.590 align:middle line:10%
It's extreme temperatures,
100 million degrees centigrade

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:24.370 align:middle line:10%
causes the helium to deform.

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And it's now got--

01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.050 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember,
neutron or proton,

01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.970 align:middle line:10%
it's got an extra orbit.

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:30.770 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
everything changes.

01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%


01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And its distributed
through our solar system

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.763 align:middle line:90%
through the solar winds.

01:25:39.763 --> 01:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, none of it
can get on Earth.

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, just tiny little
bits get on Earth

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.320 align:middle line:10%
because we have the Van
Allen radiation belt,

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.630 align:middle line:10%
all the layers of atmosphere
can't really get to us.

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:50.420 align:middle line:10%
But on the moon, there's
nothing, just, bang,

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.130 align:middle line:10%
it hits the surface.

01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
When we brought the
moon rocks home,

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that's how we
found out about it.

01:25:56.750 --> 01:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The University of
Wisconsin had some rocks.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
They heated them up,
out came this gas.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:06.822 align:middle line:10%
Cooled it down into a
liquid and we had helium-3.

01:26:06.822 --> 01:26:08.030 align:middle line:10%
So what's good about helium--

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:11.220 align:middle line:10%
>> David, we wanted to save
a lot of that for your talk

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:12.370 align:middle line:10%
tomorrow.

01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:13.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:13.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It's all about the moon.

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:16.590 align:middle line:10%
>> But if you don't come to
my talk, get this, helium-3,

01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:21.210 align:middle line:10%
if it's put into a reactor, it
will allow a reactor jump about

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:25.180 align:middle line:10%
30% to 40% more efficient
than they are today.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And here's the kicker,
zero radiation,

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.980 align:middle line:90%
clean, thermal fusion reactors.

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Today at 4 o'clock, David
Adair is going to tell you his

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
whole story, about the UFO
engine and everything about his

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
life.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's at 4 o'clock today.

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow
he's doing Post Con.

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:47.833 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about the moon.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows so
much about the moon,

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:54.090 align:middle line:84%
helium-3, and much more real
things that will surprise you.

01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's some real
surprises coming up, y'all.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:00.075 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:27:00.075 --> 01:27:03.955 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:03.955 --> 01:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%


01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Steve Mera, we
wanted to find out,

01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
are there any particular hot
spots for UFOs in Britain?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I can think of some.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to see what
you were going to say.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, not just that, but
the paranormal or seeing ETs

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.237 align:middle line:84%
and where people have had the
most experiences in Britain.

01:27:26.237 --> 01:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are paranormal
hotspots, you could say,

01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and ufological hotspots
all over the world.

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Some studies that we've been
doing for the last few years

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.292 align:middle line:84%
now, myself and my
colleague Barry Fitzgerald,

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
we're traveling around
the world looking

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.560 align:middle line:90%
at a number of these locations.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
What we have found is,
by utilizing satellites

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
in orbit of Earth,
we have managed

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to be able to graph the
electromagnetic anomalies

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:59.860 align:middle line:84%
When you actually do that,
there are certain areas

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
which are purple,
dark purple in color.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.970 align:middle line:10%
These are positive
magnetic anomalies.

01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
If you look at those against
where major UFO encounters

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
or incidents have taken place,
there's a correlation there.

01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And these particular
locations are not just

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
having UFO experiences
there, in reports,

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
but they're also having
paranormal encounters.

01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:25.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll also have
cryptids being seen.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're also having
disappearances being seen.

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And we also take
into consideration

01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the national parks, [INAUDIBLE]
has already talked about this.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is quite concerning
that these areas do also

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
represent disappearances as well
as cryptids and the paranormal.

01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we're actually
doing now is obviously

01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
looking around the world
of where these areas are.

01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were lucky enough to
visit a contact in the desert

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.970 align:middle line:90%
last year in Palm Springs.

01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And we were already armed when
we went over there, myself

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and colleague, knowing that
there was only seven miles away

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
from where they were holding
this convention that there was

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.550 align:middle line:90%
a positive magnetic anomaly.

01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So we left Contact in the
Desert where everybody

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.530 align:middle line:90%
was talking about UFOs.

01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we thought let's just go out
there and see if we were right.

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, we ended up on a place
called Canyon Road, which

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is about seven miles out from
where Contact in the Desert

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.670 align:middle line:90%
is held.

01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's out in the desert.

01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:31.180 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful night sky.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.393 align:middle line:84%
And being also a ufologist as
well as a parapsychologist,

01:29:36.393 --> 01:29:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I studied in the
field of ufology.

01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So after doing it
for so many years,

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
we kind of get a little bit
bored after half an hour,

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.530 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:29:44.530 --> 01:29:47.072 align:middle line:84%
We kind of say, if they're not
turning up after half an hour,

01:29:47.072 --> 01:29:48.180 align:middle line:90%
we're going.

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And we lose our
patience, you know?

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
interesting is that, I

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:55.150 align:middle line:90%
remember Barry turning to me.

01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we had
cameras all set up.

01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there was
nothing apart from just seeing,

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.710 align:middle line:90%
you know, a beautiful sky.

01:30:03.710 --> 01:30:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And Barry said to
me, I think it's

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.680 align:middle line:90%
time we start heading back.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But let's put the
equipment away.

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So we as soon as we
place the equipment away,

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I heard Barry over my shoulder
say, oh, they're here.

01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:22.690 align:middle line:90%


01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:27.235 align:middle line:10%
So I turned around and I
have another colleague who

01:30:27.235 --> 01:30:29.978 align:middle line:10%
was with us as well
here, Mike, who has

01:30:29.978 --> 01:30:31.270 align:middle line:10%
been doing some of the filming.

01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:32.395 align:middle line:90%
And he was with us as well.

01:30:32.395 --> 01:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And I turned and looked
at Mike, and he was just

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%
transfixed on this thing.

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
What it was, I can only
describe it, it was very large.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It appeared from nowhere,
just a blink and it was there.

01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was so uncanny that we'd
just put all the cameras away.

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.040 align:middle line:90%


01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.870 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't make this up.

01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what was happening

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.420 align:middle line:84%
there is that there was some
form of communication going on,

01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.770 align:middle line:90%
a flashing of light.

01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:02.230 align:middle line:90%
This thing went [VOCALIZING].

01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And it moved a little bit
and did a little bit more.

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:10.000 align:middle line:10%
And the whole event only
lasted about 90 seconds.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was very large.

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And looking at this, it was
like looking at an [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:15.670 align:middle line:90%
light.

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%


01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And immediately, it was gone.

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And that told us we
were in the right spot.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done is we've
correlated the information

01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:27.310 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:29.080 align:middle line:90%
We've been to the locations.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We traveled to
Ireland at a location

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.500 align:middle line:84%
where UFO activity
is experienced there,

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
another positive
magnetic anomaly.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:41.300 align:middle line:10%
And this is at an ancient site.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's an underground cavern.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing down
there but just walls.

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've set up
equipment down there.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about timing.

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And my colleague Barry will
tell you exactly the same thing.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It was all about timing.

01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, Steve, we've
got to get up this hill.

01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running up
this hill in Ireland.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.018 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely tired out.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no,
we've got to get there

01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:06.740 align:middle line:90%
for the time the sun sets.

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, what's so
special about the sun setting?

01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:10.587 align:middle line:10%
Well, I realized
once I got there,

01:32:10.587 --> 01:32:16.930 align:middle line:10%
because out from the wall
bellowed this woman's voice.

01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
had the cameras on.

01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:21.528 align:middle line:90%
And we recorded the voice.

01:32:21.528 --> 01:32:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And we've looked at this.

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot match that
language to any language we

01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:28.810 align:middle line:90%
know.

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was as clear
and as present

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
there with us as me speaking.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to myself,
this is so unusual

01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:41.410 align:middle line:10%
to have a UFO location
and a paranormal location

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:42.920 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.902 align:middle line:84%
And this is over, well,
maybe 15 months ago.

01:32:44.902 --> 01:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned
a lot since then.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.700 align:middle line:10%
We've come on and we
realized that a lot

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.310 align:middle line:10%
of the cryptid
sightings would seem

01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:middle line:10%
that they're kind of just there
to just clear you out the area.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.290 align:middle line:10%
Maybe something is going
on in these locations,

01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.970 align:middle line:10%
and they're just
there to say, get out.

01:32:57.970 --> 01:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you
here at the minute.

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's very effective.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.320 align:middle line:90%
People don't stay around.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And these locations have also
been known for disappearances.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have pushed so
far into this subject now,

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at
electron diffuse regions.

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Four or five years
ago, NASA announced

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that they have found stabilized
electron-diffused regions

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:22.390 align:middle line:90%
between the Earth and the Sun.

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what those
are, guys, they are portals.

01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's just
a professional name,

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.663 align:middle line:90%
electron diffused regions.

01:33:28.663 --> 01:33:31.060 align:middle line:10%
But we believe that
they could also

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.400 align:middle line:10%
be represented
around the planet,

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.290 align:middle line:10%
maybe even represented
with our sun.

01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of evidence that
UFOs are coming out of the sun,

01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:40.205 align:middle line:90%
even coming out of the moon.

01:33:40.205 --> 01:33:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I've always questioned the
theories of how they get here.

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And the recent surveys
show that, roughly, a UFO

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is seen every eight
seconds around the world.

01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.570 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's a lot of UFOs.

01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to
SETI astronomers,

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.610 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, space
is unusually quiet.

01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So where are they
all coming from?

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.820 align:middle line:10%
If they're utilizing
this method,

01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.130 align:middle line:10%
then they seem to be
jumping in and out.

01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're interested in.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in the
locations where these incidents

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:06.970 align:middle line:90%
are taking place.

01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:11.090 align:middle line:10%
And they're all correlated with
the paranormal, the ufological,

01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:13.080 align:middle line:10%
the crytids, and
everything else.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:34:15.402 --> 01:34:19.210 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Linda has something
to say about that.

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember, Philip J. Corso
when he did "The Day After

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Roswell?"

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.460 align:middle line:84%
He talked about nine
places on the Earth

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.990 align:middle line:84%
where the electromagnetic
field will naturally collapse.

01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And that what our
government began to realize

01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:41.170 align:middle line:84%
is where the magnetic
fields collapse

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:44.680 align:middle line:84%
is where they were getting
all of this UFO activity.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a man
from Martin Marietta

01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:50.840 align:middle line:84%
back at around 1981 or
'82 called me and said,

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
I have just done

01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:59.770 align:middle line:84%
work down in Sedona, Arizona
for Martin and for some agency.

01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we built a small
building around a device.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It was a solid brick
building, no windows.

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It was in a rural
area near Sedona.

01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And that inside
was equipment that

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:20.800 align:middle line:84%
would put out
frequencies to counteract

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.800 align:middle line:84%
this collapsing of
the magnetic fields

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because our government has been
trying to control and block out

01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:32.800 align:middle line:84%
the ability for
other technologies

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
to come in where there are
these collapsed magnetic fields.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
it's global would

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:43.780 align:middle line:84%
reinforce what you're
talking about, Steve.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:47.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Because then
that point to point,

01:35:47.170 --> 01:35:51.100 align:middle line:10%
which is Einsteinian physics,
would have natural places

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:52.330 align:middle line:10%
on the earth.

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Either they would have
computers that would know

01:35:55.690 --> 01:35:59.230 align:middle line:84%
or they would provoke
magnetic field collapses.

01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they could move
point to point to this planet.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding exactly the
same things in our research.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are
ways now, there

01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:10.960 align:middle line:84%
are software you can
use with Google Maps

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to tap into these
satellites and look

01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:16.030 align:middle line:84%
at the positive and the
negative magnetic anomalies.

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the negative ones
are are just as interesting.

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're finding
negative magnetic anomalies

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is higher rates of suicides
for unusual reasons.

01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It would seem, though,
good places and bad places

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.280 align:middle line:90%
to [INAUDIBLE] consistently.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But in regards to the
positive magnetic anomalies,

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.720 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
look for yourself

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.175 align:middle line:84%
utilizing specialized
software on the internet.

01:36:37.175 --> 01:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
showing that, actually,

01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:41.830 align:middle line:84%
at our workshop,
which is tomorrow.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
We're running a workshop.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be showing
people how you can go and look

01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and you can check and you can
go and find out for yourselves.

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:51.578 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely incredible
that these correlations,

01:36:51.578 --> 01:36:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and I think what year was that?

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Was that right around
the 1980s, Linda?

01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>> 1982 is, I think--

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> 1982?

01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I had done
"A Strange Harvest"

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.880 align:middle line:90%
about three years before.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's how he knew.

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
He worked at Mark
Marietta in Denver

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
where I was still the
Director of Special Projects.

01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So this research has
been on the cards, then,

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.220 align:middle line:84%
regarding the anomalies
for a long time.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.650 align:middle line:90%
This is not something new.

01:37:11.650 --> 01:37:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it ties into the issue of
why would southern England have

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.360 align:middle line:90%
so many crop formations.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's a huge
limestone structure.

01:37:22.690 --> 01:37:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And it is surrounded by water.

01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there's lots
of water that is going in

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.740 align:middle line:90%
through the limestone.

01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were actually tests
having to do in the early 1990s

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
before all of the so-called
hoax nonsense came about,

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
when we were really studying
fantastic, miraculous,

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.450 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And several people
were testing to see,

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
was there running water of a
certain direction and speed.

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:58.780 align:middle line:10%
And I remember there was a
paper with drawings having

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:01.840 align:middle line:10%
to do with finding
after the fact

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.980 align:middle line:10%
that there was a lot of this
running water in the areas

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.620 align:middle line:10%
where the crop circles,
the spectacular ones,

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:09.820 align:middle line:10%
were centered.

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:14.320 align:middle line:10%
And this comes to something
that I, personally, feel,

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.270 align:middle line:10%
that we are dealing
with intelligences

01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:20.410 align:middle line:10%
who relate to this planet
as spherical geometry

01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:24.550 align:middle line:10%
and that they are looking at
the planet in a completely

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:26.440 align:middle line:10%
different way than we do.

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen on
one side of the world,

01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:34.370 align:middle line:84%
there will be an antipode,
an exactly opposite point.

01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
has come up many times

01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in the study of animal
mutilations and crop

01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:43.690 align:middle line:90%
formations.

01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can't, as a species, we're
not thinking about our planet

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:53.890 align:middle line:90%
as a spherical geometry at all.

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.680 align:middle line:90%
We're still where we live.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is another
one of these gulfs

01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to have to
cross and bring ourselves up

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:09.670 align:middle line:84%
to speed in order to understand
even why there could be

01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
great big programs
that the earth would

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.690 align:middle line:84%
be a part of a program
that involves even

01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:19.355 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the solar system.

01:39:19.355 --> 01:39:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to add a weird
story that you may not have

01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:22.120 align:middle line:90%
heard.

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you brought
up crop circles.

01:39:23.650 --> 01:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And the sort of the theme
of this morning was,

01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:28.930 align:middle line:90%
are ETs helping our evolution?

01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Colin Andrews tells
a story, and I

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.630 align:middle line:90%
don't know if you've heard it.

01:39:31.630 --> 01:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
He saw the first crop circle
in 1983, came up with the term.

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
started back in 19--

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I think was '76 or '77.

01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:43.525 align:middle line:84%
Colin tells this very
bizarre story about he's

01:39:43.525 --> 01:39:45.190 align:middle line:90%
a communications guy.

01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And he buys his first
reel-to-reel tape recorder.

01:39:47.630 --> 01:39:49.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a brand new tape recorder.

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this thing
set up in the living room.

01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.303 align:middle line:90%
And he's going to test it.

01:39:52.303 --> 01:39:55.307 align:middle line:84%
And he's pulling the
microphone across the carpet.

01:39:55.307 --> 01:39:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns
on the tape recorder

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:57.890 align:middle line:90%
for the very first time.

01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when this
signal comes across.

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The TV screen just goes,
[VOCALIZING] and this voice

01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:03.210 align:middle line:90%
comes across.

01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so Colin records
the whole thing.

01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:05.665 align:middle line:90%
And it's a message.

01:40:05.665 --> 01:40:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like Steve's message
about shutting down

01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.430 align:middle line:90%
the nuclear weapons.

01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:09.430 align:middle line:90%
You guys are in trouble.

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:10.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the end.

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got all
this sort of stuff.

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And this alien takes over
the TV screen for, I think,

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:15.870 align:middle line:90%
six minutes or something.

01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:20.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's all on tape, because
Colin taped this whole thing.

01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:22.730 align:middle line:10%
So Colin said that--

01:40:22.730 --> 01:40:26.050 align:middle line:10%
of course, there was thousands
of phone calls went in

01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:27.340 align:middle line:10%
to people.

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it was ITN where
the TV station was.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.693 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were
saying, what's going on?

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Why did this message
come across the TV?

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And Colin said that
the British government

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.030 align:middle line:90%
had done an investigation.

01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:40.692 align:middle line:84%
And the TV network had
done an investigation.

01:40:40.692 --> 01:40:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing they could
determine that the two towers

01:40:43.150 --> 01:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where the signal came
through were the same towers

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that broadcast
over the same spot

01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:49.680 align:middle line:84%
where all the crop circles
would later appear.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to add a
story really quickly about--

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Also Steve, I heard
what you had to say,

01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
which is really interesting,
all these years,

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.950 align:middle line:90%
about the missile shut downs.

01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, I got hold of
one of the witnesses

01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that was on the island of
Fangatofa in the Bikini Atoll.

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:11.515 align:middle line:90%
His name is Guy Andronik.

01:41:11.515 --> 01:41:13.480 align:middle line:90%
He is a geophysicist.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.950 align:middle line:90%
It's in my books.

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:17.860 align:middle line:10%
And Guy Andronik came
to my apartment in Rome.

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was afraid because I
knew what he was going to say.

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So I got a customs
agent to come, a Mulder,

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to come while I was
doing the interview.

01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:28.420 align:middle line:90%
And we had him on camera.

01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And Guy Andronik told
me that in the 1970s

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:39.220 align:middle line:84%
France did 800 h-bomb tests on
Fangatofa in the Bikini Atoll.

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:42.560 align:middle line:10%
And on two occasions, there
were flyovers of UFOs.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.260 align:middle line:10%
They were not on vacation.

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.450 align:middle line:10%
They told me that
there was three feet

01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:49.630 align:middle line:10%
of dead fish on the runways.

01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:51.400 align:middle line:84%
He told me they had
killed the coral.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:56.680 align:middle line:84%
This is France, and never
mind America or India, OK?

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.350 align:middle line:84%
He said there were three feet
of dead fish on the runway.

01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:01.610 align:middle line:84%
They had killed the
coral and so forth.

01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:05.260 align:middle line:10%
And on two occasions,
they had flyovers of UFOs.

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
He had a court case against
the French government

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
because he had a child deformed
when the child was born.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Because he was out
on the runways while

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:17.380 align:middle line:90%
the officers were in bunkers.

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So of course, you know.

01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, terrible.

01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:23.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So I'm taping
this going oh my god,

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.850 align:middle line:10%
what are we doing
to this planet?

01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:27.640 align:middle line:10%
And then the fact
that it correlates

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.560 align:middle line:10%
whether ETs are evil or good,
are just flying over saying,

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.730 align:middle line:10%
we're here watching
this on two times.

01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we went for
pizza after that.

01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I come home, my door is open.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The guy that was the Mulder, the
guy that was the customs agent

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.300 align:middle line:90%
pulls out his gun.

01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to go
into my apartment.

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:51.010 align:middle line:10%
And you know you've
been in that apartment.

01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:52.840 align:middle line:10%
Linda, you've been there, too.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.950 align:middle line:10%
And the door is open.

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, oh, he's
going to kill somebody.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I better-- If the people that
are in that apartment that

01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:05.370 align:middle line:84%
took the film footage and
so forth, I better knock

01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
on all my, you know,
neighbors' doors

01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:09.640 align:middle line:84%
because I want them to
come out and watch this.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be in trouble
if he shoots that gun.

01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:15.310 align:middle line:84%
He went in and they had
taken the film footage.

01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:17.110 align:middle line:90%
They had taken the computers.

01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:19.300 align:middle line:90%
They had taken three cameras.

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.770 align:middle line:90%
They took my mother's fur coat.

01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They took the jewelry
and made it look like a,

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.853 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it, a robbery.

01:43:26.853 --> 01:43:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
want that film

01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:31.480 align:middle line:90%
footage to go into the world.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't shoot
anybody, thank god.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared.

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the real state
of Planet Earth.

01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't have a lot of time.

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So Steve Bassett, I
have a question for you.

01:43:45.650 --> 01:43:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:49.000 align:middle line:90%


01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Often you have referred
to fact that if America

01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:57.790 align:middle line:84%
doesn't give a disclosure,
perhaps another country might

01:43:57.790 --> 01:44:00.730 align:middle line:84%
come forward and
disclose officially.

01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you see any signs
of that happening?

01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:06.070 align:middle line:90%


01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:07.570 align:middle line:84%
There's any number
of heads of state

01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that can wrap this up,
make an announcement, not

01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.870 align:middle line:90%
every country.

01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I imagine if whoever
is ruling Somalia

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.860 align:middle line:84%
were to make an announcement,
it wouldn't have much impact.

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But France, Germany England,
Australia, Canada, and Russia.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And Russia, based on the
current political realities,

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Russia would be the number
one likelihood would be Putin.

01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can make
a really good case

01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:35.920 align:middle line:90%
why Putin would want to do this.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've been talking
about that for 20 years.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I've done, god knows,
1,200 interviews.

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:44.560 align:middle line:90%
And I usually bring him up.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Why do I do that?

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, am I a real
Putin fan, right?

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I bring it up because I
want to constantly remind

01:44:56.050 --> 01:45:01.570 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon and
even the White House,

01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:05.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't control this
issue as much as you think.

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And another nation could
announce it at anytime.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it happens
to be, say, Putin,

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:15.070 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be an enormous
geopolitical impact on the US.

01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Because that leader
will immediately

01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:20.090 align:middle line:90%
ascend to global status.

01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The United States will be
sitting there going, hey,

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:27.070 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to tell you, but
we couldn't get around to it.

01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:28.678 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to go well.

01:45:28.678 --> 01:45:32.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And just trying to remind them,
you guys, get this done, right?

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We've almost had
it several times.

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, there's a
pretty substantial history

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.800 align:middle line:84%
of insiders trying to
maybe get something going.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets pulled back.

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:51.170 align:middle line:90%
I get it, no problem.

01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But in 2017, after the election,
I got incredibly depressed.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I stored up some Xanax
and left for England.

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:04.480 align:middle line:90%


01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.638 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed there
for about six months.

01:46:07.638 --> 01:46:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there
was when To The Stars

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Academy was announced
and came out.

01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:14.490 align:middle line:90%


01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result, I
was out of the country.

01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I was basically out
of the Rolodexes.

01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And so all of my colleagues
got interviewed about that.

01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe you got
interviewed about it.

01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whatever I was
nowhere to be seen.

01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:33.760 align:middle line:84%
No problem, my fault.
But while I was there,

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I went to Moscow,
which of course

01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you always do when
you go to Europe.

01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did that
was that a Moscow television

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:46.990 align:middle line:84%
network, a national
network-run TV out of the blue

01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:49.360 align:middle line:84%
calls me up and says, we'd
like to interview you,

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.940 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was interesting.

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.857 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
have a team in London.

01:46:53.857 --> 01:46:55.982 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:46:55.982 --> 01:46:57.130 align:middle line:90%
You want to interview me?

01:46:57.130 --> 01:46:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I come to Moscow.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said fine, you pay your
ticket, you can come here.

01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So I bought a ticket, got
a visa, went to Moscow,

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed right
away, May 3rd that morning.

01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Stayed for seven days.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Met with six groups of former
Soviet and Russian officials,

01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:20.230 align:middle line:84%
military, who had retired
and like many of us, they

01:47:20.230 --> 01:47:23.080 align:middle line:84%
retired and they continued--
but, well, I say retired,

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.890 align:middle line:84%
they had been dealing with
the issue while in government.

01:47:26.890 --> 01:47:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And just like some
of our retirees,

01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:30.140 align:middle line:90%
they continue to deal with it.

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I even met with
Lavrov's chief of staff.

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.570 align:middle line:90%
He was something.

01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And these were set up to for
me by an Italian supporter,

01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:42.560 align:middle line:84%
who apparently is really
connected in Moscow.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.057 align:middle line:84%
And so I had these-- but
mostly I gave the interview.

01:47:45.057 --> 01:47:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did was
that I talked about Putin

01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and exopolitics.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.163 align:middle line:90%
No one had ever done this.

01:47:49.163 --> 01:47:52.030 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever talked
about exopolitical prospects

01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of disclosure and Putin
on any media anywhere

01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.340 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, Russian
media anywhere.

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:03.130 align:middle line:84%
US media, yeah, I was talking
about it for 20 years,

01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:06.210 align:middle line:84%
but not on Russian media
and never in Moscow.

01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And I did this as a test.

01:48:08.890 --> 01:48:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm saying,
look, how can I

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:15.140 align:middle line:84%
determine if Putin really
would be on board with this?

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:18.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's the deal,
accept an interview.

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, REN TV is
well-connected to the Pentagon,

01:48:20.890 --> 01:48:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Kremlin, rather.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very popular.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.570 align:middle line:90%
And they like it.

01:48:25.570 --> 01:48:26.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the fun show.

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:28.990 align:middle line:84%
They have all the cool
stuff on [INAUDIBLE] TV.

01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So the Kremlin would have
known I was going to be there.

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I knew the CIA would
know, absolutely.

01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:36.100 align:middle line:90%
So I give this interview.

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I leave
seven days later

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:40.187 align:middle line:90%
to see what's going to happen.

01:48:40.187 --> 01:48:42.145 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I
got to leave the country.

01:48:42.145 --> 01:48:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was good.

01:48:43.610 --> 01:48:44.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
All right, I got to
leave the country.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear anything.

01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And about three
months go by and I

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:53.320 align:middle line:84%
find that a couple of
snippets from this interview

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.170 align:middle line:84%
appears in the Russian
television show.

01:48:56.170 --> 01:48:58.750 align:middle line:84%
They have several out there
that deal with the paranormal

01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs and so forth.

01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:00.760 align:middle line:90%
They're very good.

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And they put a couple
of them in there.

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I got the show
and I looked at it.

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's all in Russian.

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And I go OK, that's
fine, that's a step.

01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then about
three weeks later,

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:15.050 align:middle line:84%
the full interview in
English was sent to me.

01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:17.277 align:middle line:84%
Now, this wasn't the high-level
production interview.

01:49:17.277 --> 01:49:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It's on my website you can find.

01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not the high-level
production interview

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.240 align:middle line:90%
that the network was doing.

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It was the journalist interview.

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.395 align:middle line:90%
She had her own camera.

01:49:26.395 --> 01:49:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I got that.

01:49:27.850 --> 01:49:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And I knew there
was no way I was

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:32.410 align:middle line:10%
going to get that material
from this journalist

01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:35.000 align:middle line:10%
if the Kremlin didn't
want it to leave.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:35.920 align:middle line:90%
So I got that.

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And I put pieces up on the net.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's up there now.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I put out a press
release in the US.

01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:42.510 align:middle line:90%
They totally ignored it.

01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Big deal.

01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:44.870 align:middle line:90%
But I said, that's interesting.

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:48.550 align:middle line:90%
But what else?

01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was shortly
after I got the tape

01:49:50.810 --> 01:50:00.433 align:middle line:84%
that Pravda RU, which is
it's a Russian propaganda,

01:50:00.433 --> 01:50:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could say.

01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:02.390 align:middle line:90%
But they do regular news.

01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:03.307 align:middle line:90%
They do lots of stuff.

01:50:03.307 --> 01:50:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people would not
consider it the New York Times.

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But it still is a conduit
and the Kremlin is involved.

01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Two articles in Pravda RU,
and basically the headline

01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing was,
UFO activist from America

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
wants Vladimir
Putin to disclose.

01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:23.070 align:middle line:90%
That's in Pravda RU.

01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.870 align:middle line:90%
You can find them.

01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They're up on my website.

01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And I said, bingo, all right?

01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I realize, he
does not have a problem

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.570 align:middle line:90%
with that being in play.

01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:36.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I got that.

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I came back to the
United States around January

01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:40.950 align:middle line:90%
and tried to do what I could do.

01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But there was not
much I could do.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.523 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of pinned down.

01:50:43.523 --> 01:50:49.500 align:middle line:90%


01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back,
which was like February,

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.220 align:middle line:84%
the To The Stars Academy had
pretty much stepped back.

01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.530 align:middle line:84%
They announced this big
announcement October 11th.

01:50:59.530 --> 01:51:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And they got the New York Times
stories out, two huge stories.

01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And then that faded out.

01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:07.160 align:middle line:90%
And they had stepped back.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:13.073 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking--
when I say they--

01:51:13.073 --> 01:51:15.490 align:middle line:84%
let me see if I can get this
right, hang on just a second.

01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:17.550 align:middle line:84%
My head is-- I'm still
having a bad day.

01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:20.260 align:middle line:90%


01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge had indicated
that something was coming.

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.390 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2016.

01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:29.440 align:middle line:84%
That Wikileaks out
of the Podesta files

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.390 align:middle line:84%
indicated something
was going on,

01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:34.570 align:middle line:84%
but there was no
announcement, right?

01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:40.413 align:middle line:84%
And so I come back and then
on October 11th of last year

01:51:40.413 --> 01:51:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is when they made the
announcement, the To The Stars

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:45.122 align:middle line:84%
Academy, which by the way, is
the most important thing that's

01:51:45.122 --> 01:51:47.680 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
disclosure thing ever.

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Others disagree.

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.500 align:middle line:84%
My workshop today at 6:00 is all
about the To The Stars Academy.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at it
from a political perspective.

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
into a lot of stuff

01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.918 align:middle line:90%
that most people haven't seen.

01:51:59.918 --> 01:52:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And you can judge for yourself.

01:52:01.210 --> 01:52:02.740 align:middle line:90%
However, that is 6 o'clock.

01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It's the last one of the day.

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of you are going to
be pretty much exhausted.

01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:09.110 align:middle line:90%
So if you need--

01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:11.273 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we'll get
energy by going to it.

01:52:11.273 --> 01:52:12.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll get all excited.

01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad you said that.

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So if any of you need to
buy like some 5-hour energy,

01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:middle line:84%
right, to come, I will
reimburse you for that.

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But the point I'm
trying to make is this--

01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:25.118 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have much
time just kind of--

01:52:25.118 --> 01:52:29.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Very quickly, why did
they announce in October?

01:52:29.592 --> 01:52:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were going to
wait until the political thing

01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:33.290 align:middle line:90%
resolved.

01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a hunch that it might
be because that whole Putin

01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:41.080 align:middle line:84%
thing sort of got out
there and their problem was

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.980 align:middle line:90%
we'd rather do it later.

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But what if Vladimir Putin
were to step in and announce?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.237 align:middle line:90%
We're flatfooted.

01:52:47.237 --> 01:52:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of the To The
Stars Academy announcement

01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:51.362 align:middle line:84%
was to get out ahead
of Hillary Clinton who

01:52:51.362 --> 01:52:53.450 align:middle line:84%
was going to disclose
once she became president.

01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:54.250 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

01:52:54.250 --> 01:52:54.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.900 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting around.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But she's not the
only president.

01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.620 align:middle line:90%
What if Putin discloses?

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Where are we then?

01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Where is the White
House and where

01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:05.633 align:middle line:84%
is the military
intelligence complex

01:53:05.633 --> 01:53:08.050 align:middle line:84%
if Vladimir Putin just made
the final announcement there's

01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:08.950 align:middle line:90%
an ET presence?

01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:10.400 align:middle line:90%
They are screwed.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.513 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're sitting
there going, hey.

01:53:12.513 --> 01:53:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that may
have had an effect.

01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you just a sense
of the dynamic that's going on.

01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And I will be talking
about that more at 6:00.

01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:22.367 align:middle line:84%
And we really got to
finish any second.

01:53:22.367 --> 01:53:23.800 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So if everyone could have
one sentence from the end,

01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:31.590 align:middle line:84%
from Steve Mera, one sentence
down to all the speakers.

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> One sentence?

01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry, what was the question.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's just one
sentence each in closing.

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, one sentence.

01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, we know--

01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:40.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't have much time.

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> One sentence.

01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:44.930 align:middle line:10%
OK, well, it's very
difficult that one.

01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, two then if you want.

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:47.154 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:48.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Two?

01:53:48.456 --> 01:53:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Just two.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies show that this
phenomenon is an age-old

01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:54.160 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It isn't something new.

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
just derived from the flying

01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:59.060 align:middle line:90%
saucer era days.

01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:02.860 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient,
age-old phenomena

01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that predates even the history
that we rely on to find out

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:10.810 align:middle line:90%
about things of the past.

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that they've
always been here.

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They continue to carry
out whatever that they do.

01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:22.330 align:middle line:10%
We see the mutilation of animals
still taking place, even today

01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:26.410 align:middle line:10%
without proper
explanation, UFO sightings

01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:29.080 align:middle line:10%
tied into paranormal
disturbances,

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.020 align:middle line:10%
also disappearances as well.

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I estimated, and we're
being conservative here,

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.550 align:middle line:84%
4.3 million people
on planet Earth.

01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:40.000 align:middle line:90%
And I don't mean just--

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, strangely disappearing.

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
finish off by saying

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.900 align:middle line:84%
there was one incident
a couple of weeks

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:52.240 align:middle line:84%
ago where I was surprised that
a woman that was found deceased

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and in a tree of all places.

01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Where?

01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:57.160 align:middle line:90%
In England?

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> This was [INAUDIBLE].

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And it got two
lines in the middle

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of a tiny little
paragraph in the paper

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and buried away in the
middle, when things like this

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.790 align:middle line:84%
should really be looked
in more seriously.

01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But what's very
interesting is the fact

01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that there is a number of
sightings in that location two

01:55:19.930 --> 01:55:22.150 align:middle line:90%
days prior to the incident.

01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Emery, let's just keep
it short because we're

01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.940 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go now.

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:33.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, all I can say is thank you
all for coming and supporting

01:55:33.670 --> 01:55:35.980 align:middle line:10%
us and being on this
conscious level.

01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And go home with
all the information

01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:41.920 align:middle line:84%
from all these speakers
and spread the word.

01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And let's all be a little
bit more compassionate

01:55:44.530 --> 01:55:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to each other and have
patience with the ETs

01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:49.540 align:middle line:90%
and the governments.

01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:52.520 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, it is
going to happen soon.

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's actually
happening right now.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:59.560 align:middle line:10%
And when you go outside
down that sidewalk,

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.544 align:middle line:10%
look up once in a while.

01:56:02.544 --> 01:56:04.900 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, I encourage you to decide
for yourself what the truth is.

01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:12.970 align:middle line:90%
But please do the study.

01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I will
always say, I wish

01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:17.620 align:middle line:84%
this would be studied
like an academic subject

01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:19.450 align:middle line:90%
in a university.

01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And the grad school
for me as a researcher

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is the study of
human consciousness.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.890 align:middle line:84%
God bless him, Robert Dean
used to say, god bless him,

01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:33.500 align:middle line:84%
"It's not about
them it's about us."

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:36.860 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I will say in closing both
on the UFO disclosure front

01:56:40.690 --> 01:56:44.312 align:middle line:10%
and on the consciousness of just
the key to how reality works,

01:56:44.312 --> 01:56:46.270 align:middle line:10%
I think there's going to
be major developments.

01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And basically,
people on the street

01:56:47.770 --> 01:56:50.560 align:middle line:10%
are going to suddenly say, you
know those crazy people that

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.880 align:middle line:10%
go to consciousness life expo?

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.640 align:middle line:10%
God damn, they were
right all along.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.060 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And there is more and
more coming from physics,

01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:06.740 align:middle line:84%
papers about the possibility
changing now to maybe

01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
a theoretical reality, that we
are in a holographic universe.

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we are in a
holographic universe,

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.400 align:middle line:84%
it has to be being projected
by another dimension.

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It can't be being
projected from within

01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:24.570 align:middle line:90%
the holographic universe.

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So if it's being projected
from another dimension

01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and you start thinking
about everything that we

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:35.480 align:middle line:84%
are challenged with on Earth
and throughout this universe,

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:40.460 align:middle line:84%
something huge is
watching everything.

01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:45.160 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hear me now or pay me later.

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Thursday nights, all
right, "Project Blue Book"

01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:56.020 align:middle line:84%
is in the process of making J.
Allen Heinich a household name.

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.600 align:middle line:90%


01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And the boys on Oak
Island are actually

01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:05.020 align:middle line:90%
starting to find something.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:07.171 align:middle line:10%
Check it out.

01:58:07.171 --> 01:58:11.650 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:58:11.650 --> 01:58:13.910 align:middle line:10%
>> A parachute only
works when it's open.

01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So keep your mind open and
weigh in on all the options.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Even the stuff you don't want
to hear or don't agree with,

01:58:22.150 --> 01:58:24.420 align:middle line:84%
weigh that in with what
you do want to hear.

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in the middle,
you'll find the truth.

01:58:28.090 --> 01:58:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:29.690 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:58:29.690 --> 01:58:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:35.240 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.779 align:middle line:90%
