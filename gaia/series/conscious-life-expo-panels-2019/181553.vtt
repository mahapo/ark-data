>> Hello, hello, hello.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you guys having a
good time at the expo?

Are you?

Are you expanded
and learning a ton?

[CHUCKLING]

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It is information overload,
but in a concentrated amount

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But how alive does that
make you feel, right?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Feels good, feels very good.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to do
a lot of that today.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We were going to blow your mind
open with the world of quantum

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
science and transformation,
and how those two worlds really

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
are one and the same
and work together

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
in such a beautiful way.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And the great news is,
I forgot my watch today,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
so we'll be out of time
completely, which is perfect.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And, wait, we have five minutes?

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:90%
You're saying-- no, we don't.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:90%
We have five minutes.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.283 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:90%

I love it.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, well first of all, I want to
thank Gaia TV for livestreaming

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:90%
this entire weekend.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:90%
It's been a phenomenal weekend.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, for those of you
that are in the room that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
don't know, if you go to
the website, Gaia.com/Lisa,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.292 align:middle line:84%
for $99, you will be able
to watch the entire weekend,

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and all the panels
that you missed,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
because you could only be
in one place at one time--

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to kind of
learn that's not true today.

[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able to see all
the lectures that you missed

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and get the entire year of Gaia
TV for free, the entire year.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a really cool deal.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So Gaia.com/Lisa.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
For the $99, you'll be able
to watch all of the events

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
from the weekend, share
it with your friends,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and watch a whole year.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.957 align:middle line:84%
Which means you can
watch my show, which

00:01:54.957 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is "Inspirations," which is an
awesome show on the network.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.755 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm really happy
to share that with you.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
time Gaia has ever

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
done that--
phenomenal deal, so I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
wanted to mention that,
which is super cool.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.722 align:middle line:84%
And after this, I'm
also going to be

00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
up at our booth, which is
also the Whole Life booth,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:90%
near the media check-in.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I will also have my books,
and I can sign them for you,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of things
that we have to give away.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So check that out as well.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share
a story with you.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I start my
day off in some type

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
of exercise and
meditative exercise,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
which I love
communing with nature.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Nature and I are
really good friends.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to be able
to hit the mountain bike

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
this morning because it was
a beautiful day outside--

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's been cold
and rainy here in LA.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I live right near
a major burn zone

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:84%
from the Southern
California fires.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
scorched in our area.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And the devastation
in the mountain--

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
which I have such a close
affinity with our mountains--

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
but it was so deep.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It was different than
I'd ever seen it before.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:90%
These 100-year-old oak trees--

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean these oak trees have
been out there for 200 years,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:10%
They were burned to
the stumps, which

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:10%
made me think, why were they
burned so hot this time?

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
They've withstood so
many different layers

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
of devastation and fires.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Through all of the
fires, these ones,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately, were burned.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And so every time
I go on my rides,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I pray to these beautiful
trees and our mountains

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:90%
so that it can restore itself.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, from going from smoldering
ash just a couple of months

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:84%
ago, these mountains
are flourishing.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And they are filled
with wildlife again.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the grass is maybe a
foot high at this point,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
with clovers, and grass,
and birds doing their job.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They went right to work
reseeding everything.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The rains that have fallen are
starting to renourish the ash

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:90%
and bring it into fertilization.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
beautiful right now.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.133 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful out there.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
sharing this with you

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is because that's exactly
what happens with our minds.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
With the incredible
mycelium beneath the surface

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of our Earth that
connects all things

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and restores and
regenerates itself,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
as does our neurology
in our brains.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It can go through
massive devastation

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and massive breakdown,
but it finds a way

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to regrow as the
neuroplasticity in our brains

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
starts to regrow
grow and reconnect

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
our ability to transform and
come up anew, as nature does

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
every spring, even through
the deepest devastation.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We've had fires, we've had
floods, we even had snow.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It is regrowing itself
and restoring itself

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
because that is
what nature does.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the exact same
way in our brain.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a very traumatic
brain injury where

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
I lost my ability to speak.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I damaged my prefrontal cortex
and the amygdala in my brain.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was shaken
so hard and damage

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
so hard it locked up
my language center.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I now speak to
millions of people

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:90%
to help transform their lives.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And yes, maybe looking
back, maybe that's

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:90%
why that needed to happen.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I lost my voice so I could
find my voice for change.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way
with all of us.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with nature.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way with
our beautiful minds

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and our beautiful brains.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that is why this
incredible topic here,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
about neuroscience
and transformation

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:90%
goes so well together.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:10%
The neuroscience
of transformation

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:10%
is our brain's ability to
reconnect, regrow, rebuild,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:10%
no matter what, every
time, every day,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:10%
if we have the knowledge to
be able to make that happen.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And this amazing panel here
is filled with that knowledge.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The level of techniques
that are available

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
right here is so
golden for you all,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.788 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really looking
forward to this conversation.

00:06:19.788 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So I want to introduce
my incredible panel.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start off
by having you each talk

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes about
what it is that you do

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.922 align:middle line:84%
and your body of
work a little bit.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
get into some questions

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that I have for you all
and some experiences

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with each of
you individually as well.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
get into your questions.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Because as I've always
said, with any level

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.495 align:middle line:84%
of conscious media, this
is a participatory panel.

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not sitting here
as passive listeners.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.917 align:middle line:90%
You are actively listening.

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You're learning, you're
listening, you're engaged,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.285 align:middle line:90%
you're going to ask questions.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a lull
in the room where

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.285 align:middle line:84%
nobody is asking a question,
that means that's your turn.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.198 align:middle line:90%
Just letting you know--

00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm pre-framing
that for you all.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So our first amazing
guest is Linda Backman.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
She is a psychologist, a
past-life regressionist,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and has a deep,
deep body of work

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
where she allows people
to go back into a journey

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
through their lives to find
their purpose, their passion,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:84%
so that they can move
forward in their lives.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Her amazing books
are transformative.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Her work in her
institutes are incredible.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I need glasses
to be able to talk

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:90%
about what it's called.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:90%
That's not in your bio, love.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.798 align:middle line:84%
What is the name
of your institute?

00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> The Ravenheart Center.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, the
Ravenheart Center.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%
You need that in your bio, girl.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so tell us a little
bit about your work.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I think about the
brain, and how you refer to it,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, I think about my
discovery about 26 years ago,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
when I thought--

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I was in my middle 40s, when
all this change happened for me,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
from conventional
psychologist to stepping

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
into soul-level work.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But I discovered
that the brain--

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:90%
this brain and your brains--

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
allow us to connect with
who we've been before,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
what is that about, how does
that show up in our life,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
so what are those past lives
that hold karma and dharma.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the capability
of our brain to connect.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I work with
clients at the soul level.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I work with
clients to understand

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
how do they plan
their current life.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
What are the purposes-- not
the purpose, but purposes--

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:90%
of your life?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
Who are your guides?

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We might say-- the title of
somebody else's wonderful

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:90%
book--

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
why do bad things
happen to good people?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Or why do-- better way to
put it-- transformational

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
experiences, just
like Lisa referred to,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
happen to good people?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So I fell into this
work through the death

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
of a colleague who
crossed over, and started

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
talking to me from
the other side,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and showed me past
lives we had shared.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
nuts back then.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I really and truly did
think that was crazy.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked my
husband, who had

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
been my husband for 25
years at that point, honey,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:90%
please tell me this is crazy.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
And he's a PhD Poli-Sci person.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:90%
So I thought he was grounded.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he told me he had
discovered his past lives when

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
he was a kid, and he
just forgot about it.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So this capable
brain that we have,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that does keep
transforming and healing,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
just like the mountains,
is capable of tapping

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
into who we've been before,
what are we working on now,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:90%
for what reason.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the most important
thing, I'll say quickly, is,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
why have all of us--
probably all of us--

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
had tough experiences,
death of loved ones,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
serious illness,
traumatic brain injury?

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:90%
It's always purposeful.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's the work that I do.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty fun
and fascinating.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's very, very true.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:90%
And also, Deborah King--

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
talk about going through
transformational experiences--

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:90%
healed herself from cancer.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And that journey, the journey
that she speaks about,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and that healing, has
helped so many people.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's truly-- she's a
New York Times bestselling

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
author of "Be Your Own
Shaman" and "Truth Heals,"

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and her newest, "Heal
Yourself," which is really

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
the crux of your work,
is teaching people

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
how they use their own ability
to heal their own bodies.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:10%
And our healing is not
outside of ourselves,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:10%
but it is inside of yourselves.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:10%
And can you share a little of
your journey with our audience.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So truly said, and thank you.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:90%
You know, what I found--

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I had cancer at 25.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a bit of a wake-up call.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:10%
I was a-- I thought--

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:10%
healthy, young,
hard-charging attorney,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:10%
just out of law school
and in the fast lane.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And it really put
me on my heels.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:90%
I looked for solutions.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.865 align:middle line:84%
This was early
alternative medicine days.

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:90%
They weren't obvious.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
You had to really dig
around and find things.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And in quick succession, very
serendipitously, of course,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:10%
I stumbled on,
first, meditation,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:10%
then I picked up journaling,
and then energy healing.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:10%
And in just a matter of a
few weeks and a few sessions,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:10%
I had an amazing
remission of this cancer.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:10%
The doctors were like, well,
you know, whatever you're doing,

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:10%
keep doing it, because they
don't have any idea either.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And that started me
on a journey, really

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:10%
around the world, training with
healers, sages, and shamans

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.815 align:middle line:10%
in all the remote places.

00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
It was a fascinating journey.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And after a lifetime
of doing that,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I became the teacher,
talking about the brain.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:10%
The brain is very possibly
most located in your stomach,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:10%
actually, and closely tied
to the heart much more

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:10%
than your head.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
things that we

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
can do today talking about all
of this and empowering you.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
As Lisa said, I have a school
where I train energy healers.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And I have half a dozen grad
teachers here this weekend,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
all teaching and
having workshops.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:10%
So it's amazing what
you can do with people.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing
how fast you learn

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to become the change
that you want to see.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:10%
So I'm glad to be here,
to be sharing with this.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely,
thank you so much.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about past life,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
healing yourself,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.374 align:middle line:84%
and Julia Mossbridge
goes into the future.

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:90%
She has an amazing background.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:84%
She's a futurist-trained
cognitive neuroscientist,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.048 align:middle line:90%
which is fascinating.

00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
She's a fellow at
IONS and a visiting

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
scholar at Northwestern
University,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and the co-author of
"Transcendent Mind."

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And her belief in the
possibility of time travel--

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
not only the possibility,
but really she's

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
researched this in
many different ways;

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
she's in middle of a huge
research project around it--

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence,
how those two can really

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
be used to convey
unconditional love.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It's embarrassing to talk
about because I don't

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm going to say.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:90%
So I hope it's good, you know?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.375 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind
of relationship

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
between unconditional
love and time travel,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and it seems to be twofold.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying
these intuitively.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this is proven,
like, right now, in 2019.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But I'm saying that--

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHING]

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a
technical solution that

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
has to come from
understanding the mathematics

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.303 align:middle line:84%
and the science of what
unconditional love actually is.

00:14:07.303 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not a feeling,
it's not a behavior,

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.518 align:middle line:90%
it's like a force or something.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a technical
or scientific solution

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that has to come
from that will then

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:84%
will be applied to help us
create super-beneficial time

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's on one of the folds.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the other fold,
I think, is that you

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
need to have scaled
unconditional love to a society

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
before you can functionally
use time travel in a way that

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mess everything up.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that there is
like both a technical link

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and a cultural necessity.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.575 align:middle line:84%
And I'm creating a nonprofit
institute that's hoping--

00:14:45.575 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to bring
together scientists

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.117 align:middle line:84%
who will work on either
the unconditional love

00:14:49.117 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
side, the time
travel side, or both,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to try to create
this for the world

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.538 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is a
positive experience.

00:14:55.538 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and we're going to learn
a little bit more about that

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
as well, and your research
projects and your body of work.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So, fascinating,
thank you so much.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This is going into
the right direction.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Next is Dr. Sue Morter, who
is the embodiment of love,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:10%
She has an incredible
book out, called

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:10%
"The Energy Codes," that's
coming out March 19,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:10%
which is based on
her decades of work,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:10%
almost 40 years of clinical
experience with people,

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:10%
really teaching them how to
use their energetic body.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Inside and outside of their
body are these energy codes

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that exist within you, and
it's based on the principles

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that she's learned, and taught,
and helped people for decades

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:90%
now, heal their bodies.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really excited about
her first book coming out--

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
40 years of her work,
and her first book

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:90%
is coming out March 19.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about that.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you could tell us a little
bit about the energy codes.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, the book is
basically teaching

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:10%
people how to build
the neurocircuitry,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:10%
but beyond that, building
electromagnetic energetic

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:10%
circuitry within their
system so that they

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:10%
can perceive themselves as
the multidimensional being

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:10%
that we truly are.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:10%
And the gist of the
book came about because,

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:10%
about 20 years ago, I had
a transcendental awakening

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:10%
to the Atman, the higher self,
to the Christed-consciousness

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:10%
level of reality.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to reproduce that
for myself in any way possible.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So I turned my life into
a living laboratory.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I would work with
my patients and clients

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
as well, with the things
that I was discovering

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that were allowing me to return
to that state of consciousness.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:10%
And so putting that
together, I ended up

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:10%
kind of retro-engineering
it and placing it

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:10%
into a codified system
of allowing people

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:10%
to train their mind
to find the real them,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:10%
to find the real you, as we
are attached to the mind,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:10%
and our journey is obviously
to unattach from that

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:10%
and to recognize the
truth of who we are.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
And as we do, we awaken as this
electromagnetic energy spirit

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:90%
system, this being as presence.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And as we are living as that,
we recognize that, as we say,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:90%
the brain is not in the head.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:90%
The brain is all that we are.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:10%
It's a processing, integrative
reality that we are living in.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to
recall the truth

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:90%
of our multi-dimensionality.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we do so , we recognize
that while we're focused

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
on our physicality, it is
not the be-all, end-all,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
that what we are actually
here to do is to steward

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
our physicality and to
steward our physical realm

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
into a higher
vibrational frequency.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We're on the cutting
edge of consciousness.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
As I began to embody that
experience for myself,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I healed the scoliosis
in my system,

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I healed migraines
headaches that

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
were plaguing me
for years, and have

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:84%
been able to manage
other injuries since then

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
with non-traditional methods,
just by utilizing an ability

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to build the circuitry, to
build a pathway for energy

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.415 align:middle line:84%
to express through our physical
realm as it is intended to be.

00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
systems that run

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
your world, the nervous system
obviously, and then also

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic
energy system.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And the energetic system
built the nervous system

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:10%
in the developing embryo.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm teaching people
how to become masterful

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:10%
at the energetic
level, thereby having

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:10%
a ripple effect into the
other less dominant systems

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:10%
in our reality.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, we
are able to cross

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of linear limitations
that we've previously

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
been bound by, recognizing
that there is nothing

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that we are not.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
We are complete, whole
creation packed in a body.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:10%
And so the book
is teaching people

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:10%
how to access that
version of themselves

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:10%
and perceive a greater
version of who we are.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine living like that all
the time and what is possible.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely incredible
to know our true birthright,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to know all of those energy
codes around all of us.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And next to Dr. Sue
is Nassim Harramein.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:90%
He is a physicist.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:10%
And he's spent 30 years
researching the connections

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:10%
in physics, mathematics,
geometry, cosmology, quantum

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:10%
mechanics.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And his findings are focused on
a fundamental geometry of space

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:90%
that connects us all.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, I was on a
panel with you, Nassim.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And you got up-- and it
was George's cosmic panel.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't shared
this with you yet.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:10%
But you got up and
you said something,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:10%
and it took me into
this incredible space.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
You said, we are
99.99999% space.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:90%
[NASSIM CHUCKLING]

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this [MAKING
 ZOOMING NOISE WITH MOUTH].

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like, we are?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And I went into this--

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:84%
really, like if everything in
us is 99.9999% percent space,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
then how can we change that
to create the health we want,

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
or the agility that we want, or
the connections that we want.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
basis of where they

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
want to start our
conversation today,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is the quantum physics of us
and everything around us being

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
space, and how we truly can work
within that to create health

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:90%
and a dynamic life.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you could share with us
a little bit about your world,

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and then talk about
that to start it off.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored to be here.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And traveling in time
and unconditional love

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%
sounds really, really cool.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I could sink my teeth into that.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:10%
But you know, it would
take a description

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:10%
or an appropriate understanding
of the concept of time.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I've thought about.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But more to the
point, space has been

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
misunderstood in our current
understanding of physics.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been ignored.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet we know that all
electromagnetic fields

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:84%
travel through space, meaning
they travel in the space.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know as well that
the material world, as you

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:90%
mentioned, is 99.99999% space.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what we call reality,
which is what we try

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand in
physics, is only 0.00001%

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of what's actually there.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And that, when we
look at it really,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
really closely, is a little
electrostatic field that's

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:90%
oscillating in the space.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, it became obvious
from early on that maybe it's

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
the space that
produce matter, not

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:90%
matter that defines the space.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied the
structure of space

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
very deeply, as did Einstein,
which geometrized spacetime.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that it could
be expressed, at the quantum

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:90%
level, in terms of information.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, space has fluctuations
at the very fine level, much

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
smaller than an atom,
billions of times

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
smaller than an atom, that
can be described as bits

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
of information, like voxels
of universal information,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and that the information can
become coherent in regions

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and produce what we call
an electrostatic field,

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:90%
that we describe as a particle.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:84%
That is, matter emerged
from information transfer

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:90%
in the space.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I started to write
equations on this,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and eventually found
a solution that

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
give exactly the correct
math for the proton,

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
for the electron, the radius.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I made predictions
that were confirmed

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
in accelerators in Switzerland.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:10%
And then, eventually,
just now, published

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:10%
a paper that extends the
theory or extends the equation

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:10%
to the universe and gives
the correct critical mass

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:10%
for the universe.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And since we're between
the atoms and the universe,

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:10%
it happens that biology
goes through that part.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
a biological system,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing a very highly
complex, self-organizing system

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of 100 trillion cells they
are transferring information

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
at an incredible rate, about
1,000 billion billion chemical

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
changes every second, a
million cell division a second.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
amazing information network,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:84%
which I think originates
from the vacuum structure

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:90%
from the space.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if we understand these
mechanisms deeper and deeper,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
then we can understand what
happens when the information is

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
impeded, when the information
becomes decoherent,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
when a region of
space in our body

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes incapable
of communicating

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the body and so
it starts doing its own thing.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
necessarily a good thing.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there is
something really powerful

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
there in our capacity to
heal ourself and understand

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the body at a completely
different level,

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
at the fundamental
energetic level that it is,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and then developing technology
to do that, to help it.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's exactly the crux
of what we wanted to talk about

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
today, was how that level of
physics and neuroscience can

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
actually impact our
daily lives with--

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always
very, very practical

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the application
of what's being spoken about--

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is how can we take this
complex information that's

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
now being proven, and
verified, and published

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
in peer-reviewed
studies, how can we

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
take that and change
the quality of our life

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:84%
into ultimate health,
into incredible future,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
into relationships that work and
relationships with ourselves?

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to break this
down into the practical here,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to take
this conversation

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.563 align:middle line:90%
into each one of you.

00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just ask
you, individually,

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:90%
questions about that.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And Julia, I'm going
to start with you.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you take this concept of
the unconditional love combined

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that we're
living in this incredible sense

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
of space, and move that
into our future of what

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.025 align:middle line:90%
we want to bring to now?

00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.696 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, small question, I know.

00:26:30.696 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I so don't want to be
disappointing in my answer,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
and so I'm struggling with that.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Because--

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.365 align:middle line:10%
>> I love scientists.

00:26:44.365 --> 00:26:45.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry, I just--

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to disappoint,
but at the same time

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I really
strongly think

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that our opinions about what
we want are usually wrong.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And so our egos tend
to think we know.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I want this thing,
if only I had that thing.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
How many times, when
we get the thing,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't feel like
we wanted it to feel?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:10%
Or we don't get a thing,
we get another thing,

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's amazing, and we
never would have thought

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:10%
of it in the first place.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think-- I sort of
object to the question.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I love scientists.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I really love it.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to
change the question.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What, specifically, would
you like to change it to?

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you go.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the
question is, how can you--

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
when I'm talking--

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Nassim-- Nassim?

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Nassim hit on it exactly--

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.558 align:middle line:84%
when you're starting to talk
about unconditional love

00:27:41.558 --> 00:27:43.613 align:middle line:84%
and time travel, OK,
great, you haven't defined

00:27:43.613 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love, you
haven't defined time travel,

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
so how are those
going to interact?

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that
the question is,

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:10%
how do you use something that's
so ill-defined right now, which

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:10%
is unconditional love, and
the world of physics, which

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:10%
includes our definition
of spacetime,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:10%
and how do you put those
together to do anything at all?

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:90%
So can I rewrite that?

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, let's be in
the inquiry of that, yes.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So of course I don't know,
because I would just do it,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:10%
That's why we're in
the inquiry of it.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.458 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, we're going to
be an inquiry of that.

00:28:20.458 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:10%
But it seems to
me, at some point--

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:10%
>> If we knew what
we were doing,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:10%
it wouldn't be called research.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a process of
explaining, how many times

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.577 align:middle line:90%
can you say, I don't know?

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:10%
But here's my thought about
it, which is probably wrong,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:10%
which is that--

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have a
job if it was right--

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:10%
which is that unconditional
love, it's an unrecognized--

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:10%
what was his name,
Pierre de Chardin?

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Chardin, yeah.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> He has that
great quote about,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that when we discover
the force of love,

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
it'll be the second time that
humankind has discovered fire.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
is exactly right.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I think he was not a dumb guy.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there's something--

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that unconditional
love will be tied

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of physical
process that physicists

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
can see in one way,
but that we interpret

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
as unconditional love.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a correlation
between our experience

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love and this
physical process to the point

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.807 align:middle line:84%
where we become convinced that
this physical process is what

00:29:24.807 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
when we're talking

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:90%
about unconditional love.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.360 align:middle line:90%
So that will be like step 1.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:10%
And then I think
that what will happen

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:10%
is, then we'll
say, lo and behold,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:10%
if we can sort through
this physical process

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:10%
and concentrate it,
what if we could

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:10%
give everyone on the
planet the experience

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.515 align:middle line:10%
of unconditional love?

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to see how
that would be bad,

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:84%
but there may be ways in
which that could be bad

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
that I can't foresee, right?

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But that seems like
the next thing.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:10%
But when Nassim is talking about
space, flipping the hierarchy

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:10%
on its head, so space
creating matter,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.058 align:middle line:10%
and then earlier
yesterday, we heard from--

00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:10%
I don't know who went
to Mark Gober's talk,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:10%
but he talked
about consciousness

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:10%
creating physical reality.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.615 align:middle line:10%
Those are similar concepts.

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
into quantum mechanics,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:84%
there's sort of this
unknown quantum world,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and then there's those sort of
viewed world of the classical.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And all these concepts seem to
be going around the same idea,

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that there's this
sort of stuff that's

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
hidden to our conscious
waking experience that's

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:84%
kind of creating our
conscious waking experience.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we discover
that relationship

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.127 align:middle line:84%
and are able to quantify
that, not only will we

00:30:41.127 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
move forward in time
travel, but we'll

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
be moving forward culturally
in our understanding of how

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to access and experience
unconditional love

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and use it for, maybe, an energy
source, and maybe other things.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So Deborah, can you talk
to us about that how that

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:90%
works in the body.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that ties
right in with--

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:10%
that's really
fascinating what you're

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:10%
saying, because it's a
field of unconditional love

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:10%
that creates healing.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.380 align:middle line:10%
And I stumbled on this--
i was such a shock to me.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.378 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine the first time--

00:31:14.378 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was one
thing to watch it,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:10%
and it was another
thing to do it.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that that first
time, I was, for a moment,

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
in a field of
unconditional love.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I had, for a moment,
forgotten about me,

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty hard to do,
if you know what I'm saying.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I had stepped out of my
personality, so to speak.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I was a young student.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I was like my students.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.288 align:middle line:84%
I had graduated, and I was
hanging around the healing

00:31:41.288 --> 00:31:42.088 align:middle line:90%
school.

00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't
resist staying there

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:90%
because it was so fascinating.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I kept wondering, what am
I doing here, I'm a lawyer.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And I came back all the time.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And one day--

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I was always parked at the back
of the room, I was very shy,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and had a terrible
problem speaking publicly.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I was very shy.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And the teacher did this to me.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, me?

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And she beckoned to
me, and she said,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:90%
come up here and replace me.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:84%
We were working on a woman that
had metastasized glioblastoma,

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
which is a normally
fatal brain tumor.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was only 21, and had
two little tiny infants--

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.340 align:middle line:90%
super-sad case.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the
fifth time, maybe,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:84%
we had this subject
in our healing room.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And there were maybe four
students around the table.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the
teacher wasn't feeling

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
well or something, but
she actually left the room

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and left me in charge.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I walked up to the
table, and I literally

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:90%
became someone else.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:10%
And I felt this field
of unconditional love,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:10%
and I just used it to
envelop the students and then

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:10%
the patient, and
everything just changed.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It was the most
amazing experience.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I've spent the
ensuing 30 years learning how

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.340 align:middle line:90%
to recreate that intentionally.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an intentional field.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:90%
You can indeed create it.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a field of intentionality.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Sue, you live in that
field when you talk about

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.670 align:middle line:90%
the embodiment of love, yes?

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exactly that.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a matter of
aligning ourselves

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:10%
to be able to perceive it.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:10%
The field is there.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating
the awareness,

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
focusing the mind
field aspect of who

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
we are onto this
vibrational frequency.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So unconditional
love is what is.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It is you.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:90%
You're made of it.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And as we train the
mind to release into it,

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.060 align:middle line:10%
it becomes profoundly
present and can

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:10%
be focused onto an object,
onto an individual,

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:10%
onto an intention, into
a project within life,

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:10%
into an expression into this
dimension that you're here

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:10%
to do.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It is meant to be.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really what we're supposed
to be doing with our faculties.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
We just we're not trained to
utilize the mind and the body

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and the breath for
the collective benefit

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
that they are truly
here to present.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
We are transmuting machines.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We are here to bring
an ability to focus

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:84%
this unconditional love
into whatever we choose.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to
determine, with our free will,

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:90%
where to focus it.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:84%
But we don't even
know how to access it,

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and so focusing it is
seems elusive to us,

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
seems miraculous when it
happens, or coincidental

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:84%
in some way, when,
in actuality, we're

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:90%
built for that exact thing.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:10%
So we're here to bring the
absolute, unwavering, loving

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:10%
presence that is, the truth that
is what is, into the illusion,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:10%
the dualistic reality on this
cutting edge of consciousness

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:10%
where we are, and bring
unity into the duality.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:90%
We're here as the answer.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So looking for
the answer is kind

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.190 align:middle line:84%
of looping back upon
itself and creating

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:90%
a real challenge for us.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of
vibrational frequency

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
perceive, training the mind

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.890 align:middle line:84%
to perceive that vibrational
frequency of true love.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And we call it
unconditional because we're

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.820 align:middle line:90%
used to being conditional.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So the opposite of that would
appear to be unconditional.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.465 align:middle line:90%
It's just divinely whole.

00:35:24.465 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And Linda, in your
clinical experience,

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
when you see people in a
state of such trauma that seem

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to have forgotten that
field of unconditional love,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.400 align:middle line:84%
how do you bring them back to
it, to remembering what Dr.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Sue is saying is your
birthright, really?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I just love
listening to what we're saying.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Because in so many ways, we're
all saying the same thing.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And therein, you find validity.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:10%
So for me, when I discovered
regression work with clients,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:10%
it's like I'm simply--

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm not the guru, for
sure, I'm the conduit.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I guide the client
to access themself,

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to access that core self, what
we call unconditional love.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:90%
I call it soul.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's that core of
who we came to be.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.998 align:middle line:84%
But-- and this is going
to sound religious,

00:36:15.998 --> 00:36:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and I certainly don't mean
it that way-- but it's

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
like we fell from grace.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this planet
didn't begin incarnation

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of
stepping into ego.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:84%
This planet began incarnation--
and we don't have it figured

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.370 align:middle line:90%
out yet--

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.980 align:middle line:90%
to live from that core self.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:90%
So when I guide clients--

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:90%
and there's no magic to it.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how
to do it, but anybody

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:90%
can learn how to do it.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I guide clients to
access that core self.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Call it unconditional love.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:10%
It's another perfect word.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating, and fabulous.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'll add on just
one more quick thing.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Clients will bring questions
like, should I change jobs,

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:10%
or should I find another
spouse, or where on the planet

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.770 align:middle line:10%
is the best for me
to live, or whatever.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's often not the
information they get back.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The information they get back
is, who are they at the core,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:84%
why are they here, and how
to move forward, and be

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
of service, and
progress in there.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're all
speaking the same language.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which is important,
because it basically can take

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.770 align:middle line:84%
each one of your body of
work and apply it to this

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.430 align:middle line:84%
conversation of how do we
practically use neuroscience

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.462 align:middle line:90%
and really truly transform?

00:37:34.462 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that this
went to the conversation

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love
is absolutely perfect,

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and that works.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to know is,
what would it look like if we--

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:90%
this isn't a lofty conversation.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a conversation of how
does it look like in our waking

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:84%
everyday lives, when we are
in that moment of getting

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.740 align:middle line:84%
sucker-punched, or the gut
punch, or the bad news,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
or the trauma, or that thing
that happened-- the politics,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:84%
the news, whatever it
is that gut-punches us--

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:84%
how do we transform
and not get stuck

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
in that place for too long,
where the neurology starts

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.328 align:middle line:90%
to go backwards and regress?

00:38:18.328 --> 00:38:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually going to
start with you, Nassim,

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.676 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
find out where--

00:38:22.676 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:90%
That was funny.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.900 align:middle line:10%
He was like, I don't know.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:90%
No, I really want you to--

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:84%
because from where you look at,
in terms of quantum science,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:84%
how do you stay
in a state of flow

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:84%
constantly and not allow
that place to get stuck?

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.103 align:middle line:84%
>> I know a lot about that,
and I get stuck a lot.

[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:38:52.035 --> 00:38:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I think, for me, I'm getting
better at not staying stuck,

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
kind of like transmuting
the stuckness

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:90%
into into forward motion.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for me--

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
relevant this is,

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:84%
but for me, I think
the first step

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is to be OK with the feeling
of hurt, pain, misery,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.220 align:middle line:84%
whatever is going on
with you, and be OK

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:84%
with it, to not try
to brush it off,

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.225 align:middle line:84%
not try to push through it,
which is not my tendency.

00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And just sit with it.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And then move,
right away, to, wow,

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
what am I learning from this?

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.390 align:middle line:90%
What is the lesson?

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:90%
It's happening for a reason.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:90%
What can I learn from this--

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:84%
compassion for myself, for
others, whatever, whatever

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:90%
is the thing that is going to--

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And if I got that
in mind, then I

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
can address it,
typically, pretty quickly,

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:90%
and find solutions, and move on.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel
strong, because I

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
feel like, wow, this is such
an opportunity to learn.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's such an
opportunity to learn

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to go through
these difficulties.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And I definitely do.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm running three
corporations, I'm

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:10%
tackling some of the hardest
physics, and technology

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.110 align:middle line:10%
developments, and you're
dealing with staff,

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:10%
you're dealing with all kinds
of financial issues, and so on.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, all through
this, my life is very dynamic.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And so finding that point of
center, of whatever happens,

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning from it
and I'm OK with it.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Dr. Sue, how do you deal
with flow when traumatic events

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.150 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is all about
the work that I do.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:84%
This is all about what I'm so
passionate about at this time.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
we are made of flow.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We are a flowing, streaming
state of consciousness.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are intended
to stay in that flow.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And the flow comes down through
the body, hits the Earth,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and rises back up again,
and creates this toric field

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.810 align:middle line:90%
as it's recycling and recycling.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And as long as that
energy is moving,

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:84%
we stay healthy
and vital, and we

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
are self-healing
and self-repairing,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and become even
self-illuminating and

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.600 align:middle line:90%
self-referencing.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And if the energy
gets blocked, we

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:84%
end up with pain patterns,
disease patterns, breakdowns

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:90%
of the system, et cetera.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So when there is a stuckness
in our life, when we come up

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:84%
against what we would
consider an obstacle,

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:84%
it is imperative that we
embrace that thing that we're

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
perceiving as an
obstacle, and recognize

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that it is here to further
our awakening process.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's here to polish us, in fact.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we're actually
requesting it.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:90%
We're asking for it.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Bring to me that
which will allow

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:90%
me to awaken even greater.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is take my
attention to the body,

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.817 align:middle line:84%
because these issues are not to
be dealt with the mind alone.

00:42:27.817 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
challenging for us.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:84%
When we use only the
mind field, we're only

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:90%
using a part of who we are.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And the vibrational
frequencies of that realm

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:84%
are not comprehensive enough
to perceive the solution

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.440 align:middle line:90%
in what we consider a problem.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you bring the
energetics of the body

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and the vibrational
frequencies of the breath

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
together, what happens is you
start to think differently.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:84%
When you tether the mind onto
the body, the mind slows down,

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and it can start to
perceive more spaciousness,

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and it can start to
respond and create

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:90%
inside that same environment.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So I personally-- and this is
when I'm teaching in the book,

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and in my school, et
cetera, is to take

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
my attention to the body
and recognize that there

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is a charge in my body somewhere
when I come up against one

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of these obstacles in my life.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I squeeze
it back, and let

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.340 align:middle line:84%
it know that contact has
been made, that the body is

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
signaling to the mind, there's
a lack of circuitry right here

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:90%
that is stopping the flow.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:10%
If I had circuits
in place right here,

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:10%
in this particular
area of the body,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:10%
I would not be stuck on this
situation because I would be--

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.910 align:middle line:10%
the energetic that is
the presence of who I am

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:10%
would be gathering
the information

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:10%
from all the different
vibrational frequencies

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.750 align:middle line:10%
of my wholeness.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm awake in
all parts of my body,

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:84%
then each part of
my body gets to act

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.290 align:middle line:84%
as a filtering system that
contributes to the solution.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not awake in
certain parts of my body,

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.955 align:middle line:84%
then the energy that rises
back up through the body

00:44:03.955 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:84%
gets stuck somewhere, because
there's no circuitry for it

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to pass through.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So we perceive that as
a knot in our stomach,

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:84%
a lump in the throat,
tightness in our chest

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
when we're up against
these challenges that

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.925 align:middle line:90%
feel like blockages.

00:44:15.925 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:84%
If we squeeze it back and
start to breathe it up and down

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:84%
through the central
channel of our being,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.130 align:middle line:84%
we not only dissipate
the discomfort

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.440 align:middle line:84%
but we start to build
circuitry for flow,

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic energy flow
through the system, which

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in turn creates an ability
for the sensory nervous system

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to pick up on a deeper sense
of self, and we settle.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system plugs
into a creative mode instead

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:90%
of a fight-or-flight mode.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
creative genius is rising

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to my consciousness, from the
gut, from the heart, et cetera,

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and I become aware
of a solution.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the same moment,
I reestablish flow--

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.700 align:middle line:84%
physical flow through
my physical body,

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.680 align:middle line:90%
with the energy being that I am.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I come up with solutions
that move me into what's next.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an ongoing,
long-lasting, sustainable

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:84%
come-from, equivalent
to the gut feeling,

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:84%
the intuition, the hunch that
we occasionally perceive.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.850 align:middle line:10%
We should be perceiving
those things all the time,

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.600 align:middle line:10%
but nobody taught
us how to do that.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So how many people in
the room have physical pain,

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.560 align:middle line:90%
have body physical pain?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And so Dr. Sue, you're
saying, going into that place,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and waking it up, and
becoming aware of it,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and paying attention to it,
and then reconnecting it

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:90%
with the flow of the body.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it's not just
enough to be aware of it.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.450 align:middle line:10%
We have to move into
it, and animate it.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.070 align:middle line:10%
Because it only hurts--

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:10%
pain is an excess of energy.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.357 align:middle line:84%
There is a blockage that
is creating a backlog

00:45:42.357 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
like a dam in a river,
and it's building up,

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's creating pain.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere else
in your system,

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.603 align:middle line:84%
there's a weakness
because that energy

00:45:48.603 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
distributed-- constantly

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.650 align:middle line:90%
redistributing itself 100%.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's an area
of a deficiency

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.890 align:middle line:90%
and an area of excess.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And something is suffering
and something's hurting.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of connecting
through the dam in the river,

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that
flow to flow again.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So by hugging it
back, by squeezing it

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and breathing through it,
we're bringing other elements

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:90%
into the mix.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's what releases
the energy flow back

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:10%
into its natural state
again, and gets the mind out

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.850 align:middle line:10%
of the way, it creates
a new sense of self

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:21.690 align:middle line:10%
where we're not living in
our heads and our ego minds,

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.060 align:middle line:10%
or our protective personality,
as I like to call it.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.078 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that no one
likes to have an ego,

00:46:26.078 --> 00:46:28.245 align:middle line:84%
but they don't mind having
a protective personality.

00:46:28.245 --> 00:46:29.770 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.620 align:middle line:10%
So I call it the
protective personality,

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and we get a lot
of good work done.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:10%
And keep in mind
that only the ego

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.450 align:middle line:10%
doesn't want to have an
ego in the first place.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:39.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.690 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So in this topic of neuroscience
and transformation-- so

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about how we
can transform in the body

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and using the field
of neuroscience.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Linda, I'm going to
ask you, how is it

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.720 align:middle line:10%
that you are using
neuroscience in your practice

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.050 align:middle line:10%
to help people transform
into their futures

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.640 align:middle line:10%
or discover their
purpose and so forth?

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Now I'm a bit like Julia--

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:90%
it's like--

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Re-ask the question.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:10%
You know, I mean, I
think that neuroscience

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.960 align:middle line:10%
means what's that core of you.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was just listening
to what Sue was saying,

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's like finding
the motivation,

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.575 align:middle line:90%
how these things can improve.

00:47:33.575 --> 00:47:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I think there are many
ways to understand it.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think all
of us on the panel

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.810 align:middle line:90%
have access to understanding it.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's finding that belief
and that understanding.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I think about
neuroscience, I think about--

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.430 align:middle line:90%
and lots of us are trained.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:90%
We're left-brain trained.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And we've finally realized
our right brains were just as

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.510 align:middle line:90%
important as our left brains.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think neuroscience
is not just

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:84%
using the neurological
system, it's

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
using our right
brain, which taps

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.080 align:middle line:84%
into the neurological
system at all times.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so where it takes me is
back into that whole notion

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:90%
of corpus callosum.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have this
corpus callouses?

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's so that there's
communication

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:90%
across the corpus callosum.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, male brains are
different than female brains,

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:90%
at least according to research.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I've not tested a male brain
and tested a female brain.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've all been
men in past lives,

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.850 align:middle line:84%
we've all been
women in past lives.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:42.040 align:middle line:90%
That's also my experience.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But it is talking back
and forth, left to right.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.797 align:middle line:90%
And I think both are crucial.

00:48:48.797 --> 00:48:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, in
so many ways, we're

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.585 align:middle line:84%
all talking about both sides
of the brain that, I think,

00:48:54.585 --> 00:48:55.585 align:middle line:90%
relates to neuroscience.

00:48:55.585 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, and transformation.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.030 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I wanted
to also open up questions

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to our room, of those
that have questions

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.950 align:middle line:84%
about the neuroscience
or transformation

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.500 align:middle line:84%
or about their individual
bodies of work,

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that you're here
for, what you want to learn,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.410 align:middle line:90%
what you have questions about.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can raise your
hand, and a microphone

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.440 align:middle line:84%
will be run to you,
and I can pick on you.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.990 align:middle line:84%
We have a gentleman right here
as well that has questions.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll
interject questions

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
in between this,
if this is good,

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.490 align:middle line:84%
but I really want you to be
a part of the conversation.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Rewinding back to
your question about pain,

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and given that there's some part
of the brain that has memory,

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.910 align:middle line:84%
at all different levels, of
these pains that accumulate

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:84%
over our lives, where in the
brain can we go to heal that?

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> --and is that the same
place we go when we have

00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love connection,
or are they different?

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I have an answer.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, go for it.

00:50:03.947 --> 00:50:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a couple
people have answers.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have an answer, I
just have a comment, basically.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you're saying,
where in the brain?

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about memory imprint.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's not in the brain.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.010 align:middle line:84%
They can't find the
memory in the brain.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They won't, because
it's not in the brain.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Information is stored in
the structure of spacetime,

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:35.110 align:middle line:84%
in the coordinate location
in which the event occurred.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And the brain is accessing
that information in parallel.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's still there.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Because within a few months,
a large part of your body

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.030 align:middle line:90%
has been redone.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually redoing
itself continuously,

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's redoing itself based
on an information network that's

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.420 align:middle line:90%
non-local.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:84%
This is why, for
instance, genes can

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.090 align:middle line:84%
have a signature
of an ancestor that

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:90%
was a few thousand years ago.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because the data
is in the gene literally,

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.310 align:middle line:84%
but because the information
is being accessed.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's the comment
I wanted to make,

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's important
for the mechanics of how

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.070 align:middle line:90%
to release the information.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, can I
piggyback on that?

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I think that people
right now are really excited

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:84%
about anything that has
the word, neuro, in it.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You can take the word, neuro,
and add it to anything.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.880 align:middle line:90%
There was a study on this.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.920 align:middle line:10%
You can add it to
anything, and people

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.910 align:middle line:10%
will be like, oh, I want
to learn about that.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.380 align:middle line:10%
It's hot, right?

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Or quantum.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Or quantum, right, exactly.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:48.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Quantum coffee.

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> But the obsession with--

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:51.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I trained as a neuroscientist.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I memorized all the
nerves in the brainstem,

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and I fell in love
with the brain.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that
obsessing about the brain is

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.720 align:middle line:84%
like obsessing about the radio
without understanding that

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a transmitting
tower somewhere else--

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.250 align:middle line:84%
the basic principle
of how a radio works--

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and not understanding that.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It just it drives me nuts.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I just
want to say, I think

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:21.160 align:middle line:84%
the question of how we can use
our minds to do these things

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is a more
comprehensive question.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just your
brain, it's the whole system.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind outside the brain.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Deborah, yes.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Piggyback onto that--

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:10%
my experience is that
the information's

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:34.650 align:middle line:10%
in your energy field.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting
inside a bubble,

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.230 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, each of you,
in your own individual human

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:41.260 align:middle line:90%
energy field.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And to answer this
gentleman's question

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
about where the pain is,
likely, it's in the field.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn to work on the
field first, your own field,

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll have great
luck at changing

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in your body.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Because your field came first,
and your body grew out of it,

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.190 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think
of your chakras,

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:84%
they're just focal points
in this energy field.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all they are.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And the things that powers
them are your emotions,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.500 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Chakras don't power emotions,
emotions power chakras.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you're blocking
an emotion you're

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:90%
going to stifle the movement.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You're all about
dynamic movement.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stifle that.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:32.190 align:middle line:10%
And the next thing you know,
you're going to have a pain.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:33.450 align:middle line:90%
It'll show up in your body.

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Because your body is just
a replica of your field.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So the memory center--
there is no memory center

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.775 align:middle line:90%
in the brain?

00:53:39.775 --> 00:53:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Unh-unh.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, OK, let's
be a little bit--

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Specific.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I want to be a
little practical about this.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.690 align:middle line:84%
There are parts of the brain
that you can mess with,

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and that if someone
has a stroke or has

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's or something, that's
going to mess up their memory.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.250 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't mean--

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:middle line:84%
so saying there's no
memory center in the brain

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.300 align:middle line:90%
is a little imprecise.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.830 align:middle line:90%
No, I was curious.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And we all maybe know people
have trouble with their memory

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because of some kind
of brain damage.

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a real thing.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.327 align:middle line:84%
Affecting the brain
really affects

00:54:12.327 --> 00:54:14.910 align:middle line:84%
what your experience is, and how
you behave, and how you talk,

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.140 align:middle line:90%
depending on what's affected.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's real.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.635 align:middle line:84%
But to me, my view-- and no one
understands the relationship

00:54:20.635 --> 00:54:22.510 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and
the mind-- but my view,

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and the view of many people I
know in the neuroscience world,

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:31.740 align:middle line:84%
which admittedly
is a selected few,

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.810 align:middle line:84%
is that that's very
much like saying,

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I broke the dial
on the radio and so

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.650 align:middle line:90%
now I can't change the station.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You just can't access.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so if you damage
your antenna, then of course,

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:44.790 align:middle line:84%
you can't access
the information.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But the antenna is not the
memory center of the radio.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, that's right.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's almost
like a computer, too.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:58.200 align:middle line:84%
You have active memory
and then you have storage.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there is an
active memory part

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that is a dynamic of the
brain, but the storage

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.950 align:middle line:90%
is in spacetime.

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Outside the brain.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to
make clear, when

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this, when I'm
talking about spacetime,

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not necessarily
thinking about spacetime

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:90%
outside your body.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
spacetime at the quantum

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.900 align:middle line:84%
level that makes up the atoms
that you're calling the brain.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's not external to
you necessarily, neither.

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It's in there, but it's on
the structure of spacetime,

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.390 align:middle line:90%
not because neurons are firing.

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So Deborah, if you
don't mind my sharing,

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:42.210 align:middle line:84%
you broke your leg a couple
of months ago, right?

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, it's been
a couple of years.

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about it
when were talking a minute ago

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.430 align:middle line:90%
about why bad things--

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:84%
or at the moment they happen,
they could be perceived as bad.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I really thought I had
empathy for everything.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:56:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm so
pro-any-marginalized-group,

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about the
animals, I'm worried about

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.810 align:middle line:90%
the environment.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I fell 20 feet
when I was at Mammoth,

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and I found out there was
only one group of beings

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd never worried about.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It was the handicapped,
physically challenged.

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd not had that experience.

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I got to spend a half a
year in a hospital, and then

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the other half of the
year in a wheelchair,

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and then I graduated
to a walker.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> But that pain--

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:84%
did you experience
that in the body?

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't a terribly
painful experience.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:10%
But the other thing,
I just blew the minds

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.240 align:middle line:10%
of all of these
physicians because I never

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.560 align:middle line:10%
took any pain medication.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.225 align:middle line:90%
>> So pain is relative.

00:56:43.225 --> 00:56:44.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Pain is relative.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Pain is relative,
fascinating.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:10%
Wow, thank you so much
for your question.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.845 align:middle line:84%
Another question
out there-- yes.

00:56:53.845 --> 00:57:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.995 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sorry, because this is
really going to sound so weird.

00:57:03.995 --> 00:57:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know if you're
the right panel to ask this.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But it keeps occurring to
me that, when we're asleep,

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.670 align:middle line:84%
we have this whole
experience of another world.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's a pretty
legitimate experience,

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:23.300 align:middle line:10%
but no one ever
tries to say, OK,

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.020 align:middle line:10%
what is the structure
of that chair

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.020 align:middle line:10%
that I sat on or
ran into, or what

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.410 align:middle line:10%
is the fundamental principle
through which, this space,

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:33.910 align:middle line:10%
you can move quickly?

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:36.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just wondering how--

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.650 align:middle line:10%
because I think that says
something substantial

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:43.450 align:middle line:10%
about our experience,
that we have experiences

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:48.108 align:middle line:10%
outside of the physical that
are equally real and present,

00:57:48.108 --> 00:57:49.900 align:middle line:10%
and we're not always
trying to define them,

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.730 align:middle line:10%
but maybe they will
help us understand

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:53.710 align:middle line:10%
the definition of
this and how even

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.370 align:middle line:10%
maybe unreal this
actually is on some level.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it, very quantum, yes.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Julia, you're lighting
up on this one.

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just super excited
you asked the question.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I think everything
is kind of switched around

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.850 align:middle line:84%
right now in terms of what
we think is important.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the brain's
more important than the mind,

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and what we see is more
important than what

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:19.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't see, and
waking time is more

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.770 align:middle line:90%
important than sleeping time.

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.145 align:middle line:84%
And I think,
someday, we're going

00:58:22.145 --> 00:58:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to get it that, really,
the function of waking time

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:28.728 align:middle line:84%
is to get our bodies
enough food and water

00:58:28.728 --> 00:58:30.520 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then go
back to sleep and do

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.733 align:middle line:90%
the work we need to do.

00:58:31.733 --> 00:58:33.568 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:58:33.568 --> 00:58:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a real experience.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, dreams stay
with you, they do.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> We do have access.

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We do have access
to the same state

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
dream state from here.

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.070 align:middle line:90%
We call it the dream state.

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:51.520 align:middle line:84%
In deep levels of
meditation, called samadhi--

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and there are many, many
levels of samadhi which

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I am engaging in regularly.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And it is a lucid dream state.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how many of you
have been in a dream

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.780 align:middle line:10%
but you knew that
you were dreaming,

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:04.330 align:middle line:10%
and you could perceive that
dreaming was happening?

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It happens often.

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It happens periodically.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
happening regularly.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.940 align:middle line:84%
When I am in that state, I
don't sleep, all night long,

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.190 align:middle line:84%
sometimes for several
nights in a row.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely lucid, and
I'm completely rested when

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I get up in the morning.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm awake at an invisible
realm, observing movies, observe

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:27.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning, observing imagery
and working with imagery,

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.280 align:middle line:84%
understanding circumstances
from the past, circumstances

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.130 align:middle line:84%
from what we would call
the future, et cetera,

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.880 align:middle line:84%
perceiving on a different level
than we are trained to perceive

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.410 align:middle line:90%
here in the third dimension.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.020 align:middle line:84%
We land here, we splat,
we get dispersed,

00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.200 align:middle line:90%
we don't know who we are.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We're freaking out
trying to figure it out.

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And we develop our
circuits and our senses

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.400 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
and primitive way.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn to refine
them and develop them

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.890 align:middle line:84%
into their true sense, what
they truly are reflecting,

00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:01.600 align:middle line:84%
we have access to this
multi-dimensionality.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And so this invisible realm,
to these physical eyes,

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is quite visible to the
third eye, to the pineal,

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
to these aspects of the
brain that are considered

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.050 align:middle line:90%
unknown or unimportant.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:16.120 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard
about the pineal gland,

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
science was saying
it's something

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that was from a more
primitive state.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It's shriveling
up and going away

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
need it anymore.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I now recognize that
nothing could be further

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
from the truth, that it's
the true eye that allows us

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
to see the truth of who we are.

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.190 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So as we stabilize and
build the circuitry

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize our consciousness
inside this system, not

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:42.610 align:middle line:84%
attached to the mind
alone, but to realize

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're just pure awareness,
and awareness has access

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:46.660 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of how do
we hone it and stabilize it

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
in such a fashion that we
can interpret what happens

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
in this dream state in a
fashion that is relevant here

01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
in this dimension, that is
helping us and serving us

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.500 align:middle line:90%
on our pathway.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.540 align:middle line:10%
And we can certainly build
the circuitry to do that.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.075 align:middle line:10%
So the invisible world
is the real world.

01:01:08.075 --> 01:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I piggyback on that?

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a bit of a
personal experience,

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and not just a
client experience.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And obviously I guide clients
into a deep theta state

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to access paths
lives and soul level.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed,
of late, for me,

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I have other people
that I'm in contact

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.620 align:middle line:90%
with that are reporting this--

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing exactly what
Sue is talking about.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I used to be this
kind of person--

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a father
that always was fearful

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't sleep.

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I grew up
with this supposedly

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
traumatic-- you
know, I'm supposed

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to believe it was traumatic
if you couldn't sleep.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.440 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
notice that there's

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
a transformative
process going on

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
for me and some of the clients
that I work with where I notice

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.525 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having nights
where it's exactly what you,

01:01:54.525 --> 01:01:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Sue, just described.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I get up in the
morning, and I'm rested,

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but I know that I never
quite fully asleep.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But when I wake up, there's
this greater awareness

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and greater sensitivity.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And what I think is going on--

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and I talk to my
spiritual guides.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt, based
on regression work,

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
we all are guided and
we all have guides.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bugging my
guides like crazy

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
in my everyday,
daytime waking state,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
like, why was my
night the way it was,

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and what's that all about,
and blah, blah, blah.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
And basically they're
saying that all of us,

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.220 align:middle line:10%
there's a huge
transformative process

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.450 align:middle line:10%
going on the planet because of
the huge needs of this planet.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I won't go down the road.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
You all know that
we're in a stuck place

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
in many ways on the planet.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be overly
dramatic about that.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But I notice this process is
happening for me for a reason,

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's downloading
more to me as to how

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to move forward in my
own life or to help

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.080 align:middle line:90%
someone else in my life.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not meant to be in
that deep, deep sleep state.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't allow the
information to surface.

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I could just comment
on that, lucid dreaming,

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
which is what you guys
are all talking about,

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
is a product of a good
solid meditation practice.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.353 align:middle line:84%
So if you meditate once
or twice a day-- but

01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
you have to do it every day.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.687 align:middle line:90%
It's an incremental process.

01:03:29.687 --> 01:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work if you do
it once a week-- so sorry.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.850 align:middle line:10%
But 20 minutes, once a
day, will give you a base

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:38.110 align:middle line:10%
in just a matter of months.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And then-- who knows
how long for you,

01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
it's an individual thing--

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
you will start lucid
dreaming, which

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
was what Sue was describing,
where you know you're dreaming

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but you can act in the dream,
and you can change the outcome,

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
you can make things happen.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Also, the mention
of the pineal gland

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
reminds me that, many years ago,
in a deep state of meditation,

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I was told that there
is a now-unused channel

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.340 align:middle line:84%
between the pituitary
and the pineal gland

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that, back in the day, thousands
of years ago human beings

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
had this open channel that
allowed them to perceive

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%
divinity in their own bodies.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we got them
stopped using it.

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And with disuse,
it stopped working.

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then we needed
priests, you see,

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
to connect us to the divine.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.810 align:middle line:10%
But it's not hard to fire
that channel up again.

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:39.340 align:middle line:10%
You just have to intend it.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:43.000 align:middle line:10%
You just focus on it,
use your intentionality,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.010 align:middle line:10%
spend a minute or two
every day doing it.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And in a matter of time,
you'll fire that channel up.

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you'll
have the divine presence

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
within your own body.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
phenomenal experience.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're talking about here
is really parallel realities.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are multiple realities
going on simultaneously,

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
backwards, forwards,
at the same time.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And Julia, you wrote about
this in "Premonition Code"

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, where you talk
about the parallel realities,

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually go
forward into the future

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:15.603 align:middle line:90%
intentionally, right?

01:05:15.603 --> 01:05:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And your whole-- can you
tell us about your research

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
study around this, and the
active study you're in?

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, I mean, I've
always got stuff out there that

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:25.473 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on.

01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think you might be
referring to the Premonition

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Code website study.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I wrote this
book with Teresa Chung.

01:05:32.572 --> 01:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Premonition Code,"

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's about the
science and practice

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.330 align:middle line:90%
of precognition and time.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And it takes people
through the steps that--

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
in your waking state, because
people like to be in control

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
or feel like
they're in control--

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
so in your waking state, can
take you through these steps

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to access information about
randomly-selected future

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.110 align:middle line:90%
events.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I created this website
where you can do this for free.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's called
thepremonitioncode.com,

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and the tab is called
Positive Pre-Cog Training.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.740 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is that I'm trying
to develop a team of people

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.840 align:middle line:10%
around the world who practice
this as an actual practice.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like a meditative practice.

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You sit down, and you actually
intend to get into this state.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
You get this information.

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
done, it feels good.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a very positive experience
as long as the target

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
for the future is not

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.900 align:middle line:90%
emotionally triggering.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I've designed the
targets to be not emotionally

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.740 align:middle line:90%
triggering for most people.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this study is just to
get thousands of people doing

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.060 align:middle line:84%
this-- right now, I
think we've about 4,000--

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
so more and more people
doing this, and just

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:47.770 align:middle line:84%
see what affects their
ability to do it-- time

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
of day, location, gender, age.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
the ability exists.

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like
trying to hone--

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to use the information
and use big data

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out what can
we learn about this ability.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
of the studies.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> About our
precognitive abilities.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, to get information
about future events, yeah.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Fascinating, fascinating,
lots of questions.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi I actually have a comment.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.598 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share an
experience with you, really.

01:07:21.598 --> 01:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
My heart feels like it's
about to jump out of my chest,

01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
so I probably should've
waited until afterwards

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.503 align:middle line:90%
and just pulled you aside.

01:07:26.503 --> 01:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I should
share this with everyone.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll make a long story short.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
When I was 20 years
old, I believe

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I traveled through a
wormhole or something.

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It was like a tunnel of
really colorful lights.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.027 align:middle line:84%
I ended up back on a movie
set when I was 15 years old.

01:07:43.027 --> 01:07:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It was the last day of shooting.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I remembered it very well.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I was in the
trailer of the star.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
look at my hands,

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have scars on
them, so I knew-- you know,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
it was just really strange.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
kind of freaked out.

01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my friend,
and he noticed.

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And right before he asked me
what I was doing, I got scared,

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and I went backwards through
this colorful light tunnel,

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
ended up back in my
20-year-old body,

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
my eyes open, wondering
what the heck was going on.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:14.513 align:middle line:84%
So when you were talking
about unconditional love,

01:08:14.513 --> 01:08:17.319 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking what was happening
in my life at that time.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:19.689 align:middle line:84%
The guy that I was in
love with broke my heart.

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:22.439 align:middle line:84%
The person I was living with
didn't even know I was there.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.939 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have any negative
feelings towards those people

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in a
really happy place.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had no worries at
that time in my life.

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was waking up and becoming
more and more conscious of all

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
this kind of stuff.

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.745 align:middle line:84%
So I just thought
I'd share that.

01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:39.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

01:08:39.545 --> 01:08:41.149 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people have
stories like this,

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.189 align:middle line:90%
so you're not the only one.

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:48.069 align:middle line:10%
And just so you know,
those kind of experiences

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:50.439 align:middle line:10%
sort of bring home the
point that what is real

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.840 align:middle line:10%
is experience.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.529 align:middle line:10%
And when I say, what is real,
of course it's all real.

01:08:56.529 --> 01:08:59.979 align:middle line:10%
The table is real, and the
space in between the nucleus

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:03.069 align:middle line:10%
of every atom, and all the
electrons, all that is real.

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:08.710 align:middle line:10%
But what I mean is that what
we think is mattering to us

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:10.660 align:middle line:10%
is the physical reality,
but actually what is

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.810 align:middle line:10%
mattering to us is experience.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you had another
question right next to her.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Wait for the microphone
there so we can all hear you

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and the livestream can hear you.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not exactly a question,
but I want you to elaborate

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.380 align:middle line:90%
on this afterwards.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.899 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of
information from dreams.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:32.552 align:middle line:10%
And I had one where all
my deceased relatives

01:09:32.552 --> 01:09:34.510 align:middle line:10%
and all their live
relatives were all together,

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:35.859 align:middle line:10%
having a ball.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:38.319 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big party,
and then, suddenly, I

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
realized, wait a minute,
you're dead, you're dead,

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing here?

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:46.689 align:middle line:84%
And they all laughed at me
and said, no, we're not.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I woke up shaking like
a leaf, and I still

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.660 align:middle line:90%
can't get rid of that dream.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.189 align:middle line:90%
It actually happened.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Did I break some
kind of time barrier?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.203 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what happened.

01:09:58.203 --> 01:10:00.095 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.514 align:middle line:90%


01:10:01.514 --> 01:10:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> This is-- I think, Nassim,
this is a lot of what you work

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.390 align:middle line:90%
on, right?

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:11.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I actually work
on gravity control.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.260 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.160 align:middle line:10%


01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.290 align:middle line:10%
But which I believe is--

01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:21.900 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love, I
believe, is gravity.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But then you'd have
to define gravity.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%


01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But so, according
to what I found,

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and
the material world

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is the result of information
flow from the structure

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime is information
at a very fine grain

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
below atomic scale.

01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And when it flows, it
creates organization

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of
space that eventually

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.910 align:middle line:84%
makes human bodies, or more and
more complexity to eventually

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.680 align:middle line:90%
produce a human being.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.280 align:middle line:10%
And the information then flows--

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.370 align:middle line:10%
the feedback of the
information flows fast enough,

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:12.380 align:middle line:10%
at a high enough rate, that
the being become self-aware.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
The being aware that they exist.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And since, in physics,
no information

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
can be lost or gained, meaning
it can only be transformed,

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
there's no way I
could physically

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.480 align:middle line:84%
write an equation in which
all information that makes up

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.820 align:middle line:90%
a human being disappears.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the idea that
when you die, you're done,

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing in
the physical world

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
that would support that view.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
For instance, all the atoms
you were made of, ever,

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
for all your life,
they're all still there.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.230 align:middle line:10%
They just reorganize
in something different,

01:11:55.230 --> 01:12:01.290 align:middle line:10%
like the dirt in the ground
or the worms that you fed.

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:05.820 align:middle line:10%
And so basically they are--

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.190 align:middle line:10%
what I'm saying is that
when your relative told you,

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:13.320 align:middle line:10%
we're not, it's because there
is nothing that ever dies.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
There's just changes.

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
There's just transformation.

01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There's just phase transition
from one phase to another,

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
from one set of organization
to a different set

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.340 align:middle line:90%
of organization.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Linda.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I dive in with
a-- this is, I think,

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
a spirituality science panel.

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about
things I believe

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
are true about the soul
it's because I've heard them

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%
over 25, 26 years.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell the client the
information, they tell me.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit like a
case study empirical method

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
of learning about the soul.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:53.490 align:middle line:10%
And so the bottom
line is, you are

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:56.550 align:middle line:10%
alive because you
have soul energy that

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:59.370 align:middle line:10%
runs your car called you.

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:02.160 align:middle line:10%
At the same time, you
have a higher self

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.640 align:middle line:10%
that is the remainder.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.300 align:middle line:10%
Your soul is in spirit
and body at all times

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
when you're incarnate.

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
When someone dies,
their soul exists.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And so we're soul and body,
soul and spirit, at all times.

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're incarnate
or disincarnate

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
makes no difference.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a lot of clients
where their spouse died.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.530 align:middle line:10%
Let's just say they were married
and they were in their 50s,

01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.650 align:middle line:10%
and their beloved spouse died.

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And the client will
come in and say to me,

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm so worried and I'm so
upset because, you know,

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
my husband's on the other
side, so when I die--

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe it'll be 30 years from
now, she says or he says--

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
will he or she be able to
assist me to cross over?

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is yes, even if
that's soul incarnates again,

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:55.770 align:middle line:10%
there's always a higher self--

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:58.560 align:middle line:10%
always, always.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Goes back to the
parallel realities.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.530 align:middle line:10%
Yes, Sue.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So what you were experiencing
in your dream state,

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.640 align:middle line:10%
where everyone was saying,
we're not dead, we're here,

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.220 align:middle line:10%
is true all the time.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.320 align:middle line:10%
They are existing
in every dimension.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And because your conscious
mind was shut off

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.250 align:middle line:10%
because you were
asleep, you had access

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:23.580 align:middle line:10%
to the vibrational
frequency just beyond where

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.500 align:middle line:10%
your conscious mind operates.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I liken it to, the
conscious mind is so busy,

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
it's spinning, and writing
stories, and thinking,

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.210 align:middle line:90%
and doing all kinds of things.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like a ceiling fan
that's spinning so fast.

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like this.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And our true, soulful
self is this essential,

01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:43.835 align:middle line:90%
this essence that--

01:14:43.835 --> 01:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
you would never
stick your finger

01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
through a rapid-moving
ceiling fan, right?

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So we stay contained in this
box that the mind is creating,

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
with our beliefs, and our
ideas, and our concept of what

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
is real.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go to
sleep goes into pause,

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can access greater
versions of yourself

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
toward the higher self, higher
vibrational frequencies of you.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so you have access to
other aspects of consciousness.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Meditation does the same thing.

01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It slows the mind, bringing
the mind onto the body,

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and breathing slowly,
and the belly, starts

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to slow it down so that we
can get in tandem with it

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and start experiencing
ourselves in a greater version,

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
toward the higher
and higher self.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, you
are the higher self,

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and you are trying
to get in the body

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and come all the way
here, onto the cutting

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:33.250 align:middle line:90%
edge of consciousness.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we get stuck
on the minefield,

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
with our beliefs, and our
ideas about who we are,

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and perceptions about
worthiness, or validation,

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
or all kinds of
externalization of our power.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And we don't stay
concentrated enough

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to drop fully in here
to the physical realm.

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so our experience
in the physical realm

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:52.800 align:middle line:90%
is a limited one.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
learning to do now

01:15:55.170 --> 01:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
is to gather ourselves together
and to create enough continuity

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
of all of our faculties
working together

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that we can automatically,
intentionally work in tandem

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and free ourselves beyond
this thinking, believing mind.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So we get to experience
it in the dream state,

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
just by default. We shut
down those circuits.

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So the circuit
breakers turn off,

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and we are able then to
replenish, and rejuvenate,

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and access higher
frequencies that

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.800 align:middle line:90%
are the rest of who we are.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes us
feel rested in the morning

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
once we've had an
opportunity to do

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But can you say, then,
that they are still here?

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> There is only here.

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for your
question and your answer.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is a question
over there in the front row.

01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.390 align:middle line:90%
That was wonderful.

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:49.525 align:middle line:84%
I love how you guys are bringing
a lot of great content here.

01:16:49.525 --> 01:16:50.325 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:16:50.325 --> 01:16:53.732 align:middle line:90%


01:16:53.732 --> 01:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a little scared.

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
time I'm speaking.

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.620 align:middle line:90%
There's so many people.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.630 align:middle line:90%


01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What is your name?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Aija.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Aija.

01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I just want to share about love.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.666 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm in
love with all of you.

01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:13.450 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:14.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm so much in love.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm often in love, but
I just wanted to share that,

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
since we are talking about
time and our higher self,

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I have experienced my past--

01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:35.250 align:middle line:84%
one of my many
pasts as being love.

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And the love was everything.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
There was no separation
between a grain of sand

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
or the person
standing next to me.

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I could feel all of it.

01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It was all just so incredibly
pure and magnificent.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And so that's one of my pasts.

01:17:56.010 --> 01:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And then my present, my
higher self, I was trying to--

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
well, I wasn't
actually trying, I

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get
information for here.

01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up with
my higher self,

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
because I was
trying to figure it

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
out what's there human
connection of establishing

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
boundaries.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I love, so I don't
know why the boundaries.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to learn
to create a boundary,

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up with the my
higher self who was in love

01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
with the entire universe.

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have world within
worlds inside of me.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so blissed out.

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well,
OK, I guess there's

01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
no boundaries for all of it.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So coming back here and
in the dream state--

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
yes, we have all these
experiences in dream state,

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't understand
that, and I'd

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.170 align:middle line:90%
love to learn from all of you.

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
But--

01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So is a question about how
do you experience unconditional

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
love with boundaries?

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be an
excellent question,

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
because in the
world of polarity--

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.876 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:05.876 --> 01:19:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> You got it.

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm
being confused here.

01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you continue with love,
but with some set of boundaries

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
while you still
keep yourself above,

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
without being buried
in the third dimension?

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, that is
a great question.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%


01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.442 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the-- if I might
just comment for just a moment.

01:19:28.442 --> 01:19:33.150 align:middle line:10%
If you know your way home,
you don't need a fence.

01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:37.020 align:middle line:10%
So if we are
anchored to the body,

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.900 align:middle line:10%
we can love unconditionally.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
If we are anchored and tethered,
we can rise up beyond this,

01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:45.437 align:middle line:90%
and go, and go, and go.

01:19:45.437 --> 01:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you experienced.

01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You experienced yourself
loving, falling in love,

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
you've found the love vibration,
which is the universal solvent.

01:19:52.890 --> 01:19:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It dissolves all barriers.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.910 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing but love.

01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So you were accessing all
of these aspects of you,

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and having that
blissful experience.

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're intended
to be having constantly.

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is, if we don't

01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
know how to anchor ourselves
in this single point

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that we
call "I am," this body,

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:18.310 align:middle line:84%
this here, then we experience
this expansive, expansive,

01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:20.990 align:middle line:84%
expansive vibration of love and
we get a little freaked out,

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
a little scared.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
We start to wobble because it's
so spacious and so beautiful.

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have to do is
learn how to anchor ourselves

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:31.660 align:middle line:90%
in our core.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So that experience of
that liberated self

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
isn't overwhelming
to our circuitry.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a circuitry issue.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:44.220 align:middle line:10%
So you don't need boundaries
if you are tethered, if you

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:47.170 align:middle line:10%
are anchored in your core.

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.990 align:middle line:10%
It's the difference
between having

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:53.378 align:middle line:10%
a fence so that I don't
get out into some-- so

01:20:53.378 --> 01:20:54.670 align:middle line:10%
that my animal doesn't get out.

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:55.587 align:middle line:10%
I have a fence for it.

01:20:55.587 --> 01:20:58.060 align:middle line:10%
But if the animal knows
its way home, it's OK,

01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.623 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't need to be fenced in.

01:20:59.623 --> 01:21:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And this is how
we've been living.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.290 align:middle line:10%
We've been living fenced in, and
have a false sense of safety.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:09.880 align:middle line:10%
And it limits us to our full
experience of the whole self

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.690 align:middle line:10%
because we've been
consumed with being safe.

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:16.350 align:middle line:10%
And that's not a good
enough goal for you.

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And another way to answer
that same question would be

01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to say that your higher self
is in your eighth chakra,

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.600 align:middle line:90%
a couple feet above your head.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.330 align:middle line:10%
And as earlier
mentioned, it's always

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:30.880 align:middle line:10%
trying to download
your higher qualities

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.060 align:middle line:10%
that you incarnated, to
express through this vehicle,

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.430 align:middle line:10%
through this body.

01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Its working all the
time, trying to come in.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're meant to be
really brave or really honest.

01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:45.732 align:middle line:84%
And so that quality
can only be expressed

01:21:45.732 --> 01:21:46.690 align:middle line:90%
through the human body.

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:49.840 align:middle line:10%
That's why you came here, to
be in relationship so you could

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.300 align:middle line:10%
develop these higher gifts.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:55.540 align:middle line:10%
I've not seen anyone
ever have a problem going

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.680 align:middle line:10%
into unconditional love.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's momentary at first.

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just a moment here
and a moment there.

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, pretty soon,
if you work at it,

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
you get longer periods.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.580 align:middle line:10%
I've not seen anyone
have an issue with it

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.900 align:middle line:10%
and not be able to be
tethered, and safe,

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:14.800 align:middle line:10%
and stay with the body--
unless it's done through drugs.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And there, I have seen
people really freak out.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Blow the circuits, yes.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a great point, and
it's a very valid question

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
about overwhelming your
circuits with this sense of-- it

01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
can be overwhelming,
unconditional love.

01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It really is vast.

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It's massive.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But in a past life,
maybe you were

01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
some type of a leader of a
love movement of some kind.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're tapping
into that, to what Linda

01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:46.330 align:middle line:90%
was talking about.

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:48.775 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having that kind
of extraordinary experience,

01:22:48.775 --> 01:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
it might be connected
to a past life.

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Could I speak
to that briefly?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.872 align:middle line:84%
>> The boundaries
are about people.

01:22:55.872 --> 01:22:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the boundaries
are about people.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because for
myself, I can't handle that.

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how I live.

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But to be here-- how
can I be here and not

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.115 align:middle line:90%
overwhelm my friends?

01:23:08.115 --> 01:23:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I tend to say
"I love you" a lot.

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, whoa,
what's wrong with you?

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So remember that
unconditional love is also

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.520 align:middle line:90%
unconditional around--

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the conditions are
also around who it is.

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So unconditional love means that
you also unconditionally love

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.840 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.810 align:middle line:10%
And so whatever you
need in that moment,

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:34.390 align:middle line:10%
if it's a boundary, if you're
not at the place where you can

01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:35.890 align:middle line:10%
live without a
fence, and right now,

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.380 align:middle line:10%
you need a boundary,
unconditional love does not

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.720 align:middle line:10%
say, no, you're wrong,
you should you know just

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.220 align:middle line:10%
make it so that--

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.097 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love says,
whatever you need right now

01:23:45.097 --> 01:23:46.180 align:middle line:10%
is what you need to build.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:48.202 align:middle line:84%
So if you need a
boundary, then you

01:23:48.202 --> 01:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
build the boundary, because
that's unconditional love

01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:51.310 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I love that we have
a neuroscience panel

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:55.333 align:middle line:84%
and we're mostly talking
about unconditional love.

01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:56.365 align:middle line:90%
I just love this.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.490 align:middle line:90%
This is so great.

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It's truly what it's
all about, right?

01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:01.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, question here in front.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:03.004 align:middle line:90%
I can't see in the back.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:06.370 align:middle line:90%


01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've spent most of my
life being driven by life, like,

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
by fears or whatever, tending to
force me down particular paths.

01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the last two years,
I'll say, I've kind of finally

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:23.440 align:middle line:84%
gotten beyond that,
where I'm not driven

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.540 align:middle line:90%
by anything in particular.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm finding
myself struggling to move

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.300 align:middle line:90%
into anything in particular.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I look at various things, I'm
like, no, not really that.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:39.223 align:middle line:84%
So can you offer me any
help-- and maybe I'm not

01:24:39.223 --> 01:24:40.390 align:middle line:90%
phrasing the question right.

01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to start
moving into something,

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
but I'm really having trouble.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.287 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm just trying to
overcome the force of laziness,

01:24:47.287 --> 01:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.050 align:middle line:90%
But-- no?

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:49.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:50.220 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you're experiencing
a sense of apathy

01:24:52.012 --> 01:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking for
a sense of purpose.

01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that could be.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.680 align:middle line:10%
>> So is it that you
are wanting to engage,

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.650 align:middle line:10%
to begin engaging in something
and you're not finding what

01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:05.720 align:middle line:10%
that would be?

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:07.050 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:25:07.050 --> 01:25:09.450 align:middle line:10%
So there is a cycle
that we go through that

01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:12.000 align:middle line:10%
is creative in
essence, and then it's

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.080 align:middle line:10%
reaping the harvest
of what we've created,

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.040 align:middle line:10%
and then it's letting go of that
which is now no longer needed

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.860 align:middle line:10%
because we've evolved, and
are evolving and evolving.

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
deconstructive phase

01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
where we accept and
embrace that it's

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:26.520 align:middle line:90%
time to move on, et cetera.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we move into a phase
that is considered the void.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.150 align:middle line:90%
And the void is actually--

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:37.140 align:middle line:84%
although we don't like it at all
from a personality standpoint--

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
it's actually where we are
in touch with our wholeness.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
made of everything.

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.357 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
that you are not.

01:25:43.357 --> 01:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
You are cosmic energy
compressed into a body.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And so you are all that is.

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And so in that, when we
are accessing the void,

01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
we're actually in touch
with our wholeness.

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important
phase, vibrationally,

01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
to embrace with
the mind, the body,

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and the breath, the heart, to
just come fully into the void.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is we don't
accept when we're in the void.

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
So we never get out of the void.

01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And resisting.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're resisting
it the whole time that

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:09.640 align:middle line:90%
we're there.

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you fully
surrender into it,

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and embrace it, and
recognize, actually, I'm

01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:15.680 align:middle line:84%
swimming in creative
soup right now,

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and if, as I fall into
love while I'm in the void,

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I will start to burr,
then spring forward

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.350 align:middle line:84%
into the next creative
cycle automatically.

01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But human beings haven't
been trained to do this.

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:29.523 align:middle line:84%
And so we resist it in
that moment, thinking,

01:26:29.523 --> 01:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I should be doing what
everyone else is doing,

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
it feels like it's
been long enough,

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.620 align:middle line:90%
and I should should should.

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we never really
get into it completely,

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.910 align:middle line:84%
so we can't come out
on the other side.

01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, thank you.

01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I totally get that, yes.

01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I am a doer, and I'm
a goal-oriented human,

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and it drives me nuts
to be in that space.

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But I have experienced
it enough times

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to realize there's something
huge there for you.

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, thank you.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely, great stuff.

01:26:57.957 --> 01:26:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's also the quantum.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
also being in that.

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
If you really are
in touch with it,

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
you can tap into these different
types of parallel universes,

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
this quantum soup
that we're a part of,

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and find what lights up
for you, because you're not

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in a place of panic or survival.

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's cool, right?

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:19.350 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:20.150 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We're not used to
that as human beings.

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, Jeanie, you
could see better,

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
because the light
is blinding me.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.735 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there you go.

01:27:26.735 --> 01:27:31.100 align:middle line:90%


01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Without getting too deeply
into my spiritual life,

01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a daughter who passed away
of cancer but was sick all her

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%
life.

01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:41.240 align:middle line:90%
She died at 29.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.222 align:middle line:84%
But the gift that
she gave me was--

01:27:44.222 --> 01:27:45.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you stand up?

01:27:45.055 --> 01:27:46.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't see you.

01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>> There, there you are.

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't usually speak
in front of people.

01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But I am having these questions
because while she was alive,

01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
she would speak of her
spiritual gifts that she had.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the gifts that
I got while she was alive--

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:10.380 align:middle line:90%
and I don't take drugs.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't do any of that.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But what gift she
gave me was to be

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
able to speak to my higher
power, which is God,

01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.490 align:middle line:90%
and ask for a gift.

01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:21.020 align:middle line:90%
And what he gave me--

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to know what state
my mind was in when he did,

01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
because it was for
five years that I got--

01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
she suffered from
cancer for five years.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And I used to call it my--

01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:36.950 align:middle line:90%
can I have my light show?

01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I would see,
strobing lights in my room,

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
sometimes just white,
sometimes colorful.

01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But I would ask for
this gift, and then it

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:54.660 align:middle line:90%
would bring me peace.

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And then I would go to sleep.

01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say Michelle, Michelle--
her name was Michelle--

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.320 align:middle line:90%
this is what happened.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.580 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I know.

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell
me, I know, Mom.

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And all her life she shared
of our higher power, which

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.940 align:middle line:90%
is God, these gifts.

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that was a gift

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that he gave me for taking care
of my daughter for 29 years.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Because she also
had spina bifida.

01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
So she had over 35 surgeries.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't want to
get too deep into that.

01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But I want to know what
state of mind my mind was.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it wasn't crazy,
but I actually saw, honest,

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.230 align:middle line:84%
strobing lights,
awake, I wasn't asleep,

01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting on my bed,
asking for my light show.

01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And I would get it.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So I need to know
what state that was.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.490 align:middle line:90%
What was it that I was seeing?

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't see it
anymore after she passed away.

01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe because
I don't ask for it

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.740 align:middle line:84%
because I'm too scared
to ask for it because I

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.610 align:middle line:90%
miss her so much.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:06.820 align:middle line:90%
But--

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe that's the only
way she'll come through.

01:30:07.450 --> 01:30:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I wasn't asleep.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I was awake.

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell me
this is what it was.

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you changed vibrations.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.550 align:middle line:90%
You changed dimensions.

01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So you went from
this dimension, where

01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
we believe we can only access
and believe things that we

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.780 align:middle line:90%
can touch, and feel, and see.

01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.780 align:middle line:84%
It's very limiting here,
on the third dimension.

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
You stepped into the
fourth dimension,

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a faster vibration
where you could see things

01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that are not
visible on the third

01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and that gave you great joy.

01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful experience.

01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage
you to continue to do it.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Just use your intention.

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You can just step there,
any time you want.

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
seeing your daughter,

01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:56.210 align:middle line:84%
likely you would see her
on the fourth dimension.

01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You can live on the
fourth dimension,

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and then if you like that,
you can move on to the fifth.

01:31:01.730 --> 01:31:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to stay
here on the third.

01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.930 align:middle line:90%
We have other options.

01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's a beautiful
experience that you shared.

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure everyone
loved hearing about it.

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Linda, did you
have something share?

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's like how to
encapsulate this and not make

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:18.920 align:middle line:90%
it overly complicated.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
When we come into body, we
choose to come into body.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We come in with a plan.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.470 align:middle line:90%
We also have free will.

01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So that plan is
not rigid, simply

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because when we're
the human body,

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.910 align:middle line:90%
we have complete free will.

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the experiments
about this culture called

01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
humanity, to see if
it's going to work.

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:45.620 align:middle line:84%
But we don't necessarily
come into body

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and plan to live out what we
would call a natural lifespan.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Often, I find, if someone
is a more experienced soul,

01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:58.550 align:middle line:90%
at times--

01:31:58.550 --> 01:32:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and underscore "at
times," their agreement

01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is not to be here for
70 years, or 80 years,

01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:09.770 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is the calculated
statistical lifespan.

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I get the sense
that your daughter--

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this just
to make you feel good--

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.995 align:middle line:84%
that your daughter, I'm
going to say is, not was,

01:32:18.995 --> 01:32:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is a very advanced soul.

01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
So she came in to teach.

01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
the reasons that she

01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.260 align:middle line:90%
passed when she passed.

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But you have access to her
and she has access to you.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's what Deb is
saying, whether it's

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.540 align:middle line:84%
fourth-dimension
connection or fifth

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and beyond, keep
tapping into that.

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.930 align:middle line:10%
That light show,
that strobe show,

01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:47.790 align:middle line:10%
usually shows up when we're
above fourth dimension

01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:50.916 align:middle line:10%
or above the astral plane.

01:32:50.916 --> 01:32:57.210 align:middle line:10%
It sounds like your daughter
is a very, very gifted soul.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:33:00.810 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things
she did show me is,

01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:03.900 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't understand
when she was saying, Mom--

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.540 align:middle line:10%
I was very confused.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And she says, Mom,
close your eyes.

01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Because she kept talking about
seeing beyond what you are.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I go, what do
you mean, Michelle?

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, just
close your eyes.

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So I close my eyes, and
she says, do you see?

01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I go, yeah, I see
darkness, I see--

01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:33.580 align:middle line:84%
no, Mom, you're
seeing beyond you.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:36.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I'm going to--

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:36.810 align:middle line:90%
she died of cancer.

01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:39.520 align:middle line:90%


01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
She says, that's
where I'm going to be.

01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, that's so incredible.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> But she taught me so much.

01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> She's always
available to you.

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And look, she's
teaching us right now.

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Such a beautiful soul.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing her with us.

01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for sharing that.

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> If I could just
add one little thing--

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I heard you say that you
were afraid to ask again

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:13.110 align:middle line:10%
because, you know, we just don't
know what's next, et cetera.

01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:17.760 align:middle line:10%
And if we are afraid because
we can't see what it is,

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.100 align:middle line:10%
it's because we're used
to seeing with these eyes.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:23.250 align:middle line:10%
I want to share with you that
it is more important to feel

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:27.700 align:middle line:10%
than it is to see, to work your
way into this more expanded

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.500 align:middle line:10%
realm.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.667 align:middle line:10%
Number one, it keeps you
grounded if you're feeling,

01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:31.810 align:middle line:10%
you're in the body.

01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:35.190 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, you're
allowing your mind to open.

01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:37.860 align:middle line:10%
So if you can build
this circuitry--

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:42.060 align:middle line:10%
and you can-- to perceive
a stable sense of self

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.190 align:middle line:10%
while you're expanding
into this place

01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:46.890 align:middle line:10%
where she is
residing and trying--

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:51.120 align:middle line:10%
was, all along, trying to
guide you into, just take

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.190 align:middle line:10%
your attention to the
body and see where there's

01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:57.120 align:middle line:10%
a charge in the body when you
think about the experience

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.070 align:middle line:10%
that you had with
the flashing lights,

01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:01.790 align:middle line:10%
and this experience
that was so intense.

01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:05.100 align:middle line:84%
There'll be an area in your
body that has a charge in it.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.190 align:middle line:10%
And if you squeeze it
back and anchor yourself

01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:10.320 align:middle line:10%
in the central
core of your body,

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.440 align:middle line:10%
and start breathing up and
down the central channel,

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.350 align:middle line:10%
you will truly begin
to move the energy

01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:19.740 align:middle line:10%
in a flow that starts to
build a photon density

01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:21.480 align:middle line:10%
and has an effect
on electrons, which

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.870 align:middle line:10%
starts to shift and
create a reality in there,

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:28.020 align:middle line:10%
in mass, that the sensory
nervous system can pick up on.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:30.510 align:middle line:10%
And you will have
a sense of self,

01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:33.120 align:middle line:10%
even though you're in
a more expanded state.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And you will gain
access to being

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:39.300 align:middle line:10%
able to commune with her
on a regular basis that

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.890 align:middle line:10%
doesn't frighten you.

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:44.340 align:middle line:10%
You will stabilize yourself
in that expanded state.

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.410 align:middle line:10%
And I highly encourage
you to do that,

01:35:46.410 --> 01:35:49.470 align:middle line:10%
because it's right
there for you.

01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:53.230 align:middle line:10%
If you can ever experience it,
you can always experience it.

01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe this is yourself
giving yourself permission now

01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
to do this, with all
of us witnessing.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have probably, I
don't know, 10 minutes left

01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:04.650 align:middle line:90%
or 15 minutes left.

01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Question, back--

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:10.390 align:middle line:90%


01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So in 2015--

01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm back here, I'm
going to come closer.

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, come on up.

01:36:17.183 --> 01:36:21.030 align:middle line:90%


01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, in 2015, I was in the
ICU and I flatlined three times.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And my question is to the whole
panel, but especially Nassim.

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have the
experiences that a lot of NDEs

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
have, but my biggest question
is, so what happened.

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was dead, and
then what, Nassim?

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Were they like, no, you
can't come, go back?

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.000 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Or was my higher self
like, yeah, no, not today.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, go back.

01:36:56.850 --> 01:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where is the
quantum neuroscience

01:37:00.450 --> 01:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
explanation for those of
us that actually died?

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything turned off, right?

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And then we're back.

01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:10.660 align:middle line:90%
And let me just be clear--

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been to all the panels
with Anita, and Danion, and all

01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:14.970 align:middle line:90%
that.

01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I understand all that stuff.

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But what I really want to
know is, for time-space,

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.320 align:middle line:90%
what happened there?

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Did I take a wrong
turn and end up back?

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:27.995 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

01:37:27.995 --> 01:37:29.776 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:29.776 --> 01:37:31.760 align:middle line:90%
What's the science behind it.

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I love the beauty of
the NDE people that have--

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
the tunnel and the--

01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get that.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.533 align:middle line:90%
I saw people rushing around.

01:37:44.533 --> 01:37:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm
still sitting here,

01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
going, so wait, wait,
why aren't I over there?

01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:37:52.362 --> 01:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, questions I get
in physics conferences

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:58.664 align:middle line:90%
are much easier than this.

01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:01.508 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:03.360 align:middle line:90%


01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I could see that.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.760 align:middle line:90%


01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.190 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to understand better
the basis of your question.

01:38:10.190 --> 01:38:12.590 align:middle line:10%
I mean, where--

01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I think that--

01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:20.360 align:middle line:10%
OK, so your body is an
organization of information.

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And part of this
organization is what

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:25.160 align:middle line:90%
you call your consciousness.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.680 align:middle line:90%


01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness
part is really

01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:36.860 align:middle line:84%
like a feed-forward
and feedback flow.

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a dynamic.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.490 align:middle line:84%
That dynamic can be in
many different states.

01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:46.940 align:middle line:84%
For instance, like
when you sleep,

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that dynamic may not
be occurring locally

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%
when you're sleeping.

01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:55.720 align:middle line:90%
So did my flow go backwards?

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.810 align:middle line:90%
I flowed that way and went back?

01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You can think of it as
your flow wanted to explore

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.760 align:middle line:90%
something different.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Like it explored
a different thing

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and then it came back
because it wasn't

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:16.460 align:middle line:84%
done exploring this thing
that's happening here.

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You're kidding.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.313 align:middle line:84%
I chose to be here
and explore stuff

01:39:19.313 --> 01:39:20.480 align:middle line:90%
instead of being over there?

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're here, it's
because you made that choice.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.920 align:middle line:90%
I truly, 100% believe that.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
There's part of
you that absolutely

01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:34.070 align:middle line:84%
wants to resolve
this experience here.

01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:36.505 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to have to take
that up with my higher self.

01:39:36.505 --> 01:39:37.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh, yeah.

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's new for you,
so yes, keep exploring.

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to have to.

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Keep exploring, yes, there's
something there for you.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, part
of it is that--

01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I get this from spiritual
people all the time.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They say, it's so dense down
here, what the heck am I doing?

01:39:56.410 --> 01:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, dude,
it's 99.99999% space.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean, it's dense?

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.535 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly space.

01:40:04.535 --> 01:40:05.860 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the tendency is to think
that evolution means extraction

01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
from the physical
world, when actually I

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:23.360 align:middle line:84%
believe that expansion, and
growth, and transcendence is

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.630 align:middle line:84%
through the physical world,
and that's why we're here.

01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's really critical.

01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just wanted
to ask the neuro--

01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Julia?

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, I
think all of them.

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:39.750 align:middle line:90%
So my brain didn't have--

01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
when I came back, I didn't have
any stroke symptoms, or memory

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:49.730 align:middle line:90%
loss, or anything like that.

01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:52.940 align:middle line:90%
I had none of that.

01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:56.600 align:middle line:84%
They still can't figure out
what happened, the doctors.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.170 align:middle line:90%
So how did my brain not melt--

01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the word would be.

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
How did my brain not
be affected by that?

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't know
your individual case.

01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm with Nassim
on this idea,

01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that the information that
your brain is storing,

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:19.640 align:middle line:84%
or that your brain has, or
actually all of our bodies,

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.310 align:middle line:84%
just everything that's
physical, exists in spacetime.

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:27.897 align:middle line:84%
And so your brain can
then go, oh, wait,

01:41:27.897 --> 01:41:29.480 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm
supposed to be doing,

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.100 align:middle line:90%
oh, right, I'm going to reboot.

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.980 align:middle line:90%


01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:36.085 align:middle line:84%
So I think my guess
is that's how.

01:41:36.085 --> 01:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to
go back, earlier,

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to your question about
what happened there.

01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I think when people
ask scientists--

01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:44.023 align:middle line:84%
I have this experience a lot,
when people ask scientists

01:41:44.023 --> 01:41:46.070 align:middle line:90%
what really happened there.

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like we know what
really happened there.

01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Your experience is real.

01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not like your
experience is false,

01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have to find out
some way to explain it.

01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Your experience itself
is a thing, just

01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:00.500 align:middle line:90%
like with the strobe lights.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Those experiences are
real, they happened.

01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop deciding
that the physical world is

01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.220 align:middle line:90%
the arbiter of what's true.

01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, it's the case

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that the physical world
is very important.

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship
between experience

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and the physical world is
very important to understand.

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's never the case
that, just because someone

01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:23.060 align:middle line:84%
can't explain what
happened physically,

01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.590 align:middle line:90%
the thing didn't exist.

01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:25.730 align:middle line:90%
The thing exists.

01:42:25.730 --> 01:42:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Experience exists.

01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing.

01:42:28.190 --> 01:42:31.820 align:middle line:84%
When he talks about
information, that's a thing,

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.650 align:middle line:90%
and that controls it all.

01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I gave up on that
part, because I was looking

01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to the doctors that were present
during that experience to give

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.170 align:middle line:90%
me the information.

01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I didn't die,
they said, you didn't die,

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
but you're not going to make
it for more than two weeks.

01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then at the two-year
mark, they said,

01:42:51.170 --> 01:42:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to make
it for two more months.

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was
September 13 of 2015.

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you need to
start listening to yourself,

01:42:59.150 --> 01:42:59.870 align:middle line:90%
you think?

01:42:59.870 --> 01:43:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
why I am saying--

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that's why I turned to
people like on this panel

01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and my spiritual affiliates,
because that world

01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:12.350 align:middle line:90%
couldn't give me the answers.

01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have--
they still don't.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.307 align:middle line:84%
>> This whole conversation--
and thank you very much

01:43:16.307 --> 01:43:17.680 align:middle line:90%
for your question--

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:22.150 align:middle line:84%
it really helps and makes us
feel lighter, if we really

01:43:22.150 --> 01:43:23.695 align:middle line:84%
understand that
we're in the quantum,

01:43:23.695 --> 01:43:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and that we exist in
multiple fields at once,

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and that this
experience of humanities

01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is the portal that we
pass through in order

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to have these
different experiences,

01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:36.910 align:middle line:84%
it's the container
we're in right now.

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It really expands the
possibilities of a human being,

01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and expands us
beyond the dimension

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.020 align:middle line:84%
we're living in, connecting with
loved ones, healing your body.

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It goes to so many
different realms

01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
if we really understand that
we are quantum human beings,

01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and that we're just
constantly forgetting

01:43:55.210 --> 01:43:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that we live in
this quantum world,

01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and that the density
of our body is,

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:02.560 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful panelists were
saying, is just the portal

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that we pass through
in order to have

01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
these different experiences,
the anchor, for now.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we'll take a couple more
questions, and then wrap it up.

01:44:16.170 --> 01:44:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> One sec, the livestream
needs to hear us.

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got two girlfriends that
have had horrendously horrible,

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.400 align:middle line:90%
horrible, horrible upbringings.

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are the two
most spiritual women

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I've ever met in my life and
I have formed the opinion,

01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:33.790 align:middle line:84%
because of people I've
met along the way,

01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that when we are spirits and
we are very strong spirits,

01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we come down and give
ourselves a lot of plot points

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to go through, maybe
more-- and then of course

01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:46.820 align:middle line:90%
you come down and go, oh my God.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.660 align:middle line:84%
But is there any
truth to the fact

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:52.690 align:middle line:84%
that a strong spirit
who's been around a lot

01:44:52.690 --> 01:44:55.360 align:middle line:84%
will give themselves a lot
more shit to go through?

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

01:44:59.130 --> 01:45:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The answer is yes.

01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> The answer is yes?

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:02.295 align:middle line:90%
>> The answer is yes.

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Sure, because each
time you return,

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.120 align:middle line:90%
hopefully you learn something.

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're back because you
want to increase your vibration,

01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're more likely to
increase your vibration if you

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.000 align:middle line:90%
give yourself some challenges.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at Nelson Mandela,
look at Martin Luther King.

01:45:18.670 --> 01:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people have
really made huge differences

01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:22.600 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And yes, their being went
through a tremendous amount

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.700 align:middle line:90%
of pain.

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
quantum science panel

01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that gets to answer these
philosophical questions.

01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:33.905 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

01:45:33.905 --> 01:45:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it's ultimately--
do you notice

01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that science tends
to go into this level

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:40.663 align:middle line:84%
of philosophical questions,
and to explain the unexplained?

01:45:40.663 --> 01:45:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, can I go back just one,
because we didn't actually help

01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:49.150 align:middle line:84%
this gal who had the
question in the back.

01:45:49.150 --> 01:45:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Because of you must
ask yourself why,

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.980 align:middle line:84%
several years
later, you're still

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.800 align:middle line:90%
focused on that experience.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.090 align:middle line:10%
And the perception is
that, possibly, you

01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:04.780 align:middle line:10%
might label it as an
interesting incident

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:07.660 align:middle line:10%
of post-traumatic stress
syndrome-- very interesting

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:11.260 align:middle line:10%
in that she wasn't conscious
while she was having it.

01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But you were so shocked to wake
up and have people tell you,

01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:15.610 align:middle line:90%
you just died.

01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:17.410 align:middle line:90%
That threw you into PTSD.

01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, three times.

01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I would love for
you to get treatment on that

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:22.780 align:middle line:90%
point.

01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:25.480 align:middle line:10%
And then next time you're
here, next year, you'll

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:28.060 align:middle line:10%
be interested in other
aspects of the conference

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:31.510 align:middle line:10%
because you won't be any more
concerned that, oh my God,

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:33.160 align:middle line:10%
that's going to happen again.

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm actually--

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I am a little irritated that--

01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> We can tell.

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:41.992 align:middle line:90%
>> --that I didn't go.

01:46:41.992 --> 01:46:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little
irritated that-- and I

01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:44.980 align:middle line:90%
believe I made that decision.

01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That's not beyond
my belief system.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.960 align:middle line:90%
But I'm a little irritated why.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
consciousness I have now,

01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't get that answer.

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's kind
of peachy over there.

01:46:57.610 --> 01:46:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yesterday, in the
near-death panel that I hosted,

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.110 align:middle line:84%
there were seven panelists who
all had near-death experiences,

01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and they all said
the same thing--

01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I loved it on the other side.

01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's why I call
them near-life experiences.

01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because it's the
closest to fully experiencing

01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:19.610 align:middle line:90%
life.

01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's wonderful, because
from that panel to this,

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:29.170 align:middle line:84%
it's the evidence of the
existence of other dimensions

01:47:29.170 --> 01:47:31.390 align:middle line:90%
beyond this one that we're in.

01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And that is so--

01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
it's not just science
that you need to prove it,

01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:39.250 align:middle line:84%
but if you talk to
enough people and they

01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:41.800 align:middle line:84%
have these different
experiences that are all

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:44.440 align:middle line:84%
connected without ever
knowing each other,

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.210 align:middle line:90%
you can make your own decisions.

01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't need science
to make our own decisions.

01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:51.190 align:middle line:84%
If we feel so strongly
about something,

01:47:51.190 --> 01:47:54.070 align:middle line:84%
if it's ecologically
good for ourselves

01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and good for the
planet, then it's OK.

01:47:56.470 --> 01:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to wrap this
up with a question here.

01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Where do you see--

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:07.890 align:middle line:84%
based on your body of work, what
do you see as a perfect world

01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:09.300 align:middle line:90%
to live in?

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take this into
the future a little bit.

01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Because our planet
does stand to tend

01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:19.440 align:middle line:84%
to be stuck in different
polarities and dichotomies.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.690 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as
the perfect world

01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:24.485 align:middle line:84%
to live in, based on
your body of work.

01:48:24.485 --> 01:48:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with you.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, great question.

01:48:26.655 --> 01:48:32.340 align:middle line:90%


01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand that we are
all responsible for the progress

01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and we are all
responsible for the progress

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.850 align:middle line:90%
of this universe.

01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:50.880 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think
that we're taught--

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.800 align:middle line:10%
maybe a lot of us believe
that, but the only way

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.630 align:middle line:10%
that anything shifts
is because we actively

01:49:00.630 --> 01:49:04.800 align:middle line:10%
take steps for things to shift.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I would love to see.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And idealistically,
that we would live in--

01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and I know this is said
so many different ways--

01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:20.610 align:middle line:84%
but we would live in equality,
that everything matters,

01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that everyone else matters,
that the planet, that Gaia--

01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's not by accident
that it's livestreaming

01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:30.540 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia, and that's
what's going on,

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.750 align:middle line:84%
or Pachamama, which is another
beautiful way to put it--

01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that we care for every living
thing and there is equality.

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just
finish my statement

01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:45.000 align:middle line:84%
by saying I know, because I have
clients access paths lives not

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.590 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, that most, if
not all, cultures where

01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:54.100 align:middle line:84%
there is life that is not
earth are healthy cultures.

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So we can learn
from those cultures.

01:49:57.570 --> 01:49:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Deborah.

01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I look forward to a
world where there is unity

01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:04.080 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not where we live today.

01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:07.160 align:middle line:10%
We live in a state of--

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.580 align:middle line:10%
a much more divisive
state of consciousness

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:15.030 align:middle line:10%
that's very different from place
to place and person to person.

01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But in fact there is a way
to transcend that and be

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.830 align:middle line:84%
in a state of unity
consciousness.

01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state, you no longer

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.950 align:middle line:84%
see someone as flawed, you
only see their perfection.

01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Because on that level,
we're all perfect.

01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great goal to have.

01:50:31.410 --> 01:50:32.560 align:middle line:90%
We can get there.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.310 align:middle line:84%
We can get there
in this lifetime.

01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:36.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:50:36.435 --> 01:50:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Julia.

01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This is somewhat paradoxical
because I'm a futurist.

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is the absolute
perfect world right now.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I think we got it right here.

01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:49.152 align:middle line:90%
I think it's awesome.

01:50:49.152 --> 01:50:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I think it's beautiful.

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of suffering.

01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:53.498 align:middle line:90%
I think there's a lot of anger.

01:50:53.498 --> 01:50:54.540 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of sadness.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of grief.

01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:56.320 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of fear.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of jealousy.

01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of hope.

01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:58.847 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of love.

01:50:58.847 --> 01:51:00.420 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of joy.

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.150 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff is just
like colors on the rainbow,

01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and this is gorgeous.

01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:08.110 align:middle line:90%


01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well said.

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I completely agree, Julia.

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And it is what I
call heaven earth.

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It isn't heaven on earth.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:22.660 align:middle line:84%
That would be to imply that
there is a dualistic reality.

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:23.810 align:middle line:90%
This is one thing.

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.680 align:middle line:90%
It is heaven earth.

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to
awaken, to being

01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:28.440 align:middle line:90%
able to perceive it as such.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:33.920 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that as
we recognize that we

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.640 align:middle line:10%
are the creator, the
created or the creation,

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.130 align:middle line:10%
and the action of
creating constantly--

01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:42.120 align:middle line:10%
that's what's happening here.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And as we embrace
all of that, we

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
are able to perceive that this
sadness, the grief, the shame,

01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the guilt, is equal to the joy,
the elation, and the bliss, et

01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:57.740 align:middle line:84%
cetera, and that when we can
embrace all of those energies

01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:00.350 align:middle line:84%
equally, then we
become non-prejudiced

01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:01.420 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.260 align:middle line:90%
We become nonjudgmental.

01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't bite into
story, and we just

01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:07.610 align:middle line:84%
embrace all the
vibrational frequencies.

01:52:07.610 --> 01:52:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
embrace them all,

01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:11.150 align:middle line:90%
we become fully illuminated.

01:52:11.150 --> 01:52:14.840 align:middle line:84%
When we reject half of the
human experience, we struggle.

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the friction
of that dualistic reality

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that we, in slow
motion, wake up.

01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And we could do that a lot
faster, in a quantum sense,

01:52:25.190 --> 01:52:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in the instantaneous
moment, now,

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.600 align:middle line:84%
by becoming less judgmental,
within ourselves,

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:33.410 align:middle line:84%
of our own experiences, and
just embrace them fully.

01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
experience of heaven earth.

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Nassim.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.770 align:middle line:90%


01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> With the fear of being seen
as materialistic, my ideal,

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:57.466 align:middle line:84%
just because, frankly, I'm
ready to get the fuck out--

01:52:57.466 --> 01:52:59.425 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:52:59.425 --> 01:53:03.140 align:middle line:90%


01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to gravity control,

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to infinite energy
available in every point,

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
being able to transcend

01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the surface of our planet,
and live in the universe,

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and travel the galaxy,
meet the other beings that

01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
live in our universe,
meet the other cultures,

01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and really transcend
the limitations that

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:33.000 align:middle line:84%
are threatening the future
generation of our planet.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
work has to be done now,

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's why we
all work incessantly to make

01:53:41.010 --> 01:53:41.810 align:middle line:90%
it possible.

01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:48.290 align:middle line:10%
And so, for me, that's
the ultimate goal,

01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:middle line:10%
and it's my vision
of our future.

01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, absolutely, a
great way to wrap this up.

So I love that you all
painted this incredible vision

01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of heaven on earth,
as we are now,

01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and to all of us to be
participating in that vision

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.200 align:middle line:90%
actively.

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
To actively participate in
the vision of this world

01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.840 align:middle line:84%
being our utopia
now is something

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.690 align:middle line:90%
that we could all absolutely do.

01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So go forth and have this great
vision, hold this great vision.

01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:20.510 align:middle line:84%
