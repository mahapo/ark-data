00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be
a journey for everyone

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:90%
to go on today.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go on a journey
to the other side, kind of,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and take everybody, including
everyone on the livestream,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:90%
along with us.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say,
first of all, thank

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you so much to Gaia TV for
hosting this livestream.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's such an amazing
opportunity for people

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
who aren't physically
in the room

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share
this and watch it

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
for a whole year,
which is incredible.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So as you signed up or
if you're, obviously,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
on the livestream, you can
watch the Conscious Life

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Expo for the rest of the
year, and also all the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.447 align:middle line:84%
shows on Gaia for a full year,
which is absolutely amazing.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't yet
signed up for that,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
if you want to tell your
friends, it's gaia.com/lisa,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be able to get the
whole deal for the whole year

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and watch the expo
and everything.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much to Gaia
for creating all of this,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:90%
for all of us to be connected.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And-- so here's some
questions I want to ask you,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to ponder
throughout this entire session

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Where do we go
when we transition?

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Where did our loved ones go, and
can we connect with them again?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Are there other realities?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:10%
Are there other dimensions?

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Or are they around us right now?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:10%
Do you have to have a
near-death experience in order

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.425 align:middle line:10%
to connect with
these other realms?

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Are those questions that
anybody in this room

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
has ever asked themselves?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
to those questions

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
will be attempted to be answered
by our wonderful, incredible

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
panel here, who
collectively, I just

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
want to recognize the
incredible consciousness that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
up here that has had the
experience of journeying

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to different levels of--
it could be a dimension,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
it could be a realm, it could
be a state of consciousness.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And they've joined
us here collectively

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to share and connect this
whole room with that realm.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So we truly are going
on a journey today.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
We're truly going to
cross into other realms.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And as you're there, don't
just be a passive participant.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
actively participate

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation and lend
your consciousness and journey

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and be inquisitive in
your mind and really

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
be a part of this conversation,
because that's truly

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
what conscious
conversations are all about.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I have, for the past going on
20 years, hosted The Aware Show,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and it is a constant conscious
conversation through all that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I do on The Aware Show and
Hay House Radio and Gaia TV,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:84%
it's just a continuous
conscious conversation

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that absolutely rocks.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It never ends, because
it's insatiable curiosity

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:90%
that we all have, ultimately.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we get to visit this
earth at this time, and then

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
we get to have
conversations like this,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
which are so amazing.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I do want to let you know
that our wonderful guest here,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Dannion Brinkley, not only has
he been struck by lightning

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and died five times, but
just a couple of months

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
ago he went through an
incredible experience

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:84%
where he went in for
a routine surgery

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and once again left the planet.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't leave
his body there.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.405 align:middle line:84%
He came back again, because
you've got something

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:90%
to share, Dannion Brinkley.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.387 align:middle line:90%
>> I was missing all of you.

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:46.763 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm going to have
each person just share

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
their experience for about five
minutes each so that you can

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
get an idea of who
we have up here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Dannion?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dannion Brinkley, and I
never believed any of this.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was all nonsense.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And one day I never believed any
of it, the next day I was dead,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and the day after that I became
everything I never believed,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
so I have never had a
way to have to doubt it.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure out how to
operate in dimensional reality,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
how to listen to people who
supposedly have passed on

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
or who have died.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Well nobody dies and
nobody goes to hell.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So with those two things in
mind, knowing that nobody

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
dies and no one goes to
hell, because if anybody

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to go to hell,
it would have been me.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been
over there six times

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and I've never been to hell yet.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So I've been struck
by lightning, OK, dead

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:90%
for 28 minutes.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Completely paralyzed
for six days,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed
for seven months.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Two years to learn to
walk and feed myself.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.726 align:middle line:84%
Had a lot of time to think
about our spiritual reality.

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, I
got struck by lightning

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
again in the exact
same situation,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
talking on the telephone.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
That means I didn't
get it the first time,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
says OK, Dan, we
gonna kill you again.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when you think about
it, struck by lightning,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
if you look on the
Black's Law Dictionary,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a plausible defense
as an act of God.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
So physical.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I got struck by
lightning again as I wake up.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So I was only knocked
out for 45 minutes.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
13 years later, I had to
have open heart surgery.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Seven years after that I
had to have brain surgery.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
That's spiritual,
physical, and mental.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So each of those
levels of consciousness

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
took me to a different
place or a point.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
110 days ago, I collapsed
and I went to the hospital

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and I had an aneurysm
under my heart valve

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that was bleeding some kind
of film on to the heart valve.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I went into
open heart surgery.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:10%
When the doctor got in there
in open heart surgery, the scar

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:10%
tissue damage done from
being struck by lightning,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:10%
they never gave me a day,
a chance to come out of it.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
When I left surgery--

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
this was October 14, 2018,
I had no blood pressure.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I get into the
intensive care unit.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I had no blood pressure.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.495 align:middle line:90%
So they had to resuscitate me.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:24.295 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Then five days later, after
getting my blood pressure

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to 25% heart function, at
2:00 AM on a Sunday morning

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I went into cardiac arrest.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I was lying in the bed.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%
I heard the machines go off.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I flatlined.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The guy was beating on
my chest, broke two ribs

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
trying to resuscitate me.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm calm.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing next to
the nurse on my right

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:90%
watching all this go on.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:90%
They bring me back to life.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything is frantic.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I stay seven minutes and I
go into cardiac arrest again.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm back
standing, watching it.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I saw who was doing it.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But this time, the girl that was
beating on my chest, she said,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't resuscitate me.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.685 align:middle line:84%
And this guy looked like putting
those heating pads on me.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Like heating pads on the chest.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And he kept saying, ready?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.503 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm thinking to
myself, would somebody

00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
please give this guy
whatever he wants?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he's starting to be
irritating by saying ready.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was the one pushing
the button with the pedals.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So they said go, cause they
couldn't resuscitate me

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
by beating my chest,
and I'm brought back.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So I have an experience
of non-local understanding

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.695 align:middle line:90%
of our identity.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We are great, powerful,
and mighty spiritual beings

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
There is only one thing that
can ever go wrong in your life,

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
is you've allowed something
to affect your dignity.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And that skews your
direction and your purpose.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:10%
There is nothing else
can happen to you.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.758 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing else
anybody can do to you.

00:08:00.758 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
you can do, because you

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
were chosen to be here
and you chose to be here.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I stand categorically,
unequivocally

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
on those two principles
as you look at yourself.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Nobody dies.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Now a lady asked
me one time, she

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
said, well, what about "hayl"?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
She meant hell, but
she's making fun of me.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, honey, let
me tell you something.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I never brought it up.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They never brought it
up while I was up there,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and I damn sure
didn't bring it up.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, so when you get down
to the end of the tunnel

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
panoramic life view,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
know where hell is,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
you start yelling, where's hell?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Where's hell?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.194 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they'll
accommodate you.

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Just not the first
question that comes to mind.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Dannion.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.548 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm still here, partying on.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Literally, thank you
for being here today.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything for you.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Aww.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.285 align:middle line:90%
My love.

00:08:58.285 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Booth 500, booth 500.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be, as
I told you, fun panel.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Kelly Gallagher.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Kelly Gallagher, an
award-winning documentary

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:90%
filmmaker.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Also a five-time cancer
survivor herself.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Phenomenal ability
to not only survive

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and to live, but
to communicate what

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
it is in our world that
makes us toxic in order

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
to have gotten to that state.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're a huge
advocate as well.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us your story?

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to follow
up Dannion, huh?

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a five-time
cancer survivor,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
powered by my sixth pacemaker
and a new heart valve, 120

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:84%
blood transfusions, iron
poisoning, mercury poisoning,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
17 dental fillings that
came out wrong and kept

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:90%
me relapsing into cancer.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And now that I'm
sitting next to you,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure that I had all
these near-death experiences,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
but I've known you for
38 years and maybe I

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
caught all that from you.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Fifi.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I told you he'd call me Fifi.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Fifi.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So the first time
I almost died, it

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
was from drugs in the
rock and roll business,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:90%
way back when I knew Dannion.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have--

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I kind of thought this
five-time cancer survivor,

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
six pacemakers, all
that stuff-- kind

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of like I was on the
learning disabled program.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like God was
trying to get my attention

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and I just wasn't listening.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Like I knew it the whole time.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I was just very resistant to
my path and to my journey.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
hear God knocking,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I would just do
another line of cocaine

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and hope he would
go away because I

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to be of service.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back when
I was like 20 years old.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So I went on with my
life, and eventually I

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
woke up and decided
that I hadn't

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
died from cancer nor cocaine
when I was in my 20s,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and got my life back together
and went on to college

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and went on to be a
television producer.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I got rediagnosed
with cancer again,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I started to, what I know
now, was download poetry which

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought was really
singsongy, kind of goofy

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and had this cadence
of being so childlike.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But I was busy judging
it instead of sharing it

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and resisting my path,
which is what I kept doing.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was physical
and part of it was cosmic

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and I think disease is dis-ease.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I was not comfortable in my
own skin and in my own body

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and kept having to get
another lesson, I guess.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I kept detoxing and
was learning about,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
physically, how to get well, not
necessarily always emotionally

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:90%
how to get through it.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So I've never
really talked about

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:90%
my near-death experiences.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I kind of just jumped over it
and went right into activism.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I made a movie about mercury.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of the
producers of "Vaxxed".

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I produced with Tim Ray last
year, Get Your Life Back Now.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We did 21 episodes
of news you can use

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
about how to heal your body.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:90%
But when I--

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Booth 500.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Booth 500.

00:12:15.612 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But I went to the other side
while I was having a bone

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
marrow transplant.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- guess I
went through a tunnel,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but I arrived where I was
sitting three seats from God.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was waiting in
line, and the other guys

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.762 align:middle line:84%
were talking too long,
and I was waiting in line,

00:12:35.762 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there,
and all of a sudden,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to move
up to go talk to God

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and somebody is pulling on
my arm and they woke me up

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and I'm back.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:90%
That-- shit.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And the message was,
you're not done yet.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:90%
You've got work to do.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You have a mission
on this planet.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:90%
You have a purpose.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to be here.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.708 align:middle line:84%
And as I've died numerous times
also and just kept coming back,

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
it's like, you're not done yet.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:90%
You're not done yet.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not done yet.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a list of
things that still

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.628 align:middle line:84%
need to be fixed on
the planet and I'm here

00:13:07.628 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to do that, because
life's a journey.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a cosmic path.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>> We are not done.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:90%
We're not.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.173 align:middle line:90%
None of us are done.

00:13:13.173 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Are you noticing a theme here?

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Noticing a theme?

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What a bummer.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got work to do.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Depressing.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We're working
in the coal mine.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The theme so far is I haven't
listened, I haven't listened,

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and I needed that wake up
call once, twice, three times.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So now--

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda Backman is a past-life
regressionist and she was just

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
recently on my Gaia show--
you can watch on the network--

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
an amazing conversation
we had, Linda,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
who really is a PhD, a scholar
in therapy and speaking

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
with people, but in
regressing people to help

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
understand your purpose in
life, your path, the reason

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're here.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And even going forward,
what that purpose

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
can fuel in your life.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:84%
A huge, incredible
sense of identity

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
comes from past life regression,
and you're just amazing at it.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me see if I can meet
that beautiful introduction.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You can.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Lisa.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, my story is
kind of different,

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:10%
and I've known Dannion for a
number of years and met Kelly.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:10%
So I've not had an NDE.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, how to
make this short?

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.445 align:middle line:84%
My husband always says,
honey, your stories are long.

00:14:35.445 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> We like stories.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa said five
minutes, so OK.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I go back
in my life, I can

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
remember my grandmother died
when-- one of my grandmothers

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%
died when I was about 12.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated with
this open casket and her body

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
laying in the casket.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered why
it didn't scare me.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I moved forward
and I got married.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I got married not at
14-- some people--

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
but I got married about
age 20 to the lovely person

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:90%
who's still my husband.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And we had a baby a
couple years later.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:90%
He's fine.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
He's 49 years old and
lives in San Francisco.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Then I got pregnant again
and threatened miscarriage

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:90%
for four months, basically.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm an archaic person in her
early 70s, so no ultrasound.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.422 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctors kept saying,
Mrs. Backman, I don't know.

00:15:29.422 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Today you're miscarrying,
tomorrow you're

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:90%
not, blah, blah, blah.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I delivered that
baby at 26 weeks

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:90%
of a average 40-week pregnancy.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
He lived a few
hours and he passed.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Hugely traumatic experience.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I still wasn't
spiritual in any way.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward some years
later, about age 40,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I became a licensed
psychologist.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Which I sort of thought was--

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was my pinnacle,
to be perfectly honest.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I'd get
that much formal education.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And so for about 15 years
I was a psychologist

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:90%
in private practice.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I loved doing death,
dying, and grief work,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know why.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1993,
about 26 years ago,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I experienced the
death of my colleague

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
with whom we'd built
this group practice.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:84%
He died at age 32,
when I was about 46.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And so sort of my NDE, but
it really isn't an NDE.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:84%
He started talking to
me from the other side.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I will use appropriate
language, but you know, WTF.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:10%
It's like, I'm a psychologist,
and psychologists

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:10%
don't do this kind of stuff.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%
But I was fascinated.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
He started showing me
scenes of past lives.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd skimmed one of
Brian Weiss's books--

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do with it--

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:90%
maybe a year before that.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But I realized, just as I
think NDE brings forward

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're a soul living
one life to the next,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:90%
we are required to evolve.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We're required to
come into body.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
This is where we grow and learn.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll also agree with
Dannion, there is no hell.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I've been guiding clients
for about 25 years now

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
into past lives and
to their soul level.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Michael Newton, for any of
you who've heard of his books,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:90%
he was once one of my mentors.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:10%
And so I have no
doubt we are a soul.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt there
is something that comes

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:90%
after this human existence.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that what you're
experiencing in an NDE is real.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:10%
I guide clients to discover
their past lives in order

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:10%
to both balance karma
and embrace dharma,

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:10%
what have you accomplished
before that you don't

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:10%
think you've ever accomplished.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we work at the
client's soul level.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So I've been learning about
the soul for about 25 years,

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
understanding how we evolve, why
we evolve, working with guides,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
working with loved
ones on the other side.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I love what I do, and some
people in my family and friends

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
think it's time to
retire, and it's like no.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:10%
No, I'm not retiring
because I'm passionate--

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Purpose.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>> --about what I do.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're proud
of our purpose.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, Kasey,
let's make it happen.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well, Kasey and
Brad Wallis They are together

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:84%
here on this panel because of
an incredible journey that Brad

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
went on and found or encountered
this light energy group from

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the other side name Julius.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And Kasey brings through
Julius in through

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
this incredible journey
and this communication

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that this group of beings wants
to share with us, so welcome.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you could share your
story, that would be amazing.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I get very emotional because
I still have a brain injury.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
12 years ago, I was in
a car accident that--

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I was a vehicle stopped.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
All the other vehicles
in the intersection.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Kid ran a red light,
split my vehicle in half.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They took me to the emergency
room, massive brain injury.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't shut my brain down so
they diagnosed me with medicine

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:90%
that I overdosed and died on.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I was gone for eight hours.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Kasey was not my
wife at the time.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
While I was gone,
watching everything

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that was transpiring,
I was assured

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
somebody who was going to be
taking care of everything that

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:90%
was happening here.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had the very unique and
wonderful experience of Julius.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I had taught them
in a prior life.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I was their teacher.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was their turn
to return the favor

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.855 align:middle line:84%
and now teach me what the human
experience is really all about.

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:51.505 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:52.305 align:middle line:90%
And I'm back.

00:20:52.305 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:90%
And they've come with me.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up in the
hospital, the doctor,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
who was actually a very close
friend of mine, had just walked

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
down, told everybody they were
ready to take me to the morgue.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I jumped up out of
bed, scared the hell out

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
of everybody.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And Kasey was standing
there, and immediately

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
started channeling Julius back
to me and explaining to me

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.355 align:middle line:84%
the agreements we had
made, and that we together

00:21:35.355 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
would be spending
the rest of our lives

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
together talking to
people all over the world.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's now what we do.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I still have my brain injury.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I was told I would never
lead a normal life.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I would only be
able to pick weeds

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of my life
because of that brain injury.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And through Julius' help,
we activated dormant parts

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and left
the damaged part alone,

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:84%
which the doctor, who was
my therapist at the time,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
left his practice
with the information

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that Julius had given him
and now treats brain injury

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
people in his own
quiet little practice

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:90%
on the Indian reservations.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.365 align:middle line:90%
It's not what we think.

00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
There are two things that
humans are afraid of--

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
death and how powerful you are.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Throw death out the window,
folks, it's all an illusion.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's only how
powerful you are left.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It's time to wake up
and learn just how

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:84%
powerful you are, because
you hold all the answers.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.820 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is turn
the light on for you.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.526 align:middle line:90%
The rest is up to you.

00:23:26.526 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an honor to be here.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It's our honor to
be with all of you.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
We hope you are well.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
We know that you are safe
and we send you blessings

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.035 align:middle line:84%
and invite you to
have extraordinary joy

00:23:39.035 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:90%
through this journey.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
That-- thank you so
much, because the energy

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:84%
in the field that just
came into this room, anyone

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:90%
experience that?

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was
expansive and honoring.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.386 align:middle line:90%
Honoring.

00:24:11.386 --> 00:24:12.186 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And the incredible space
that Anita Moorjani

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
is sitting right next
to you can handle with

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, that is so beautiful.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Anita. do you feel
that next to you?

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Totally.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.916 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes

00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:10%
>> That was very
beautiful and powerful.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Anita has had just an incredible
journey in this lifetime,

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and went through the portal of
learning what self-love really,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
truly is through the hard way.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Through stage 4 end stage
cancer and complete failure.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.475 align:middle line:84%
And she went into this
incredible experience--

00:25:00.475 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and stay with us--
do you see how we're

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:90%
elevating the conversation?

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you see where we are now
compared to where we started?

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into Anita's story
and join her on her journey.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you, Lisa.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:90%
In 2006 I had end stage cancer.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:90%
At that point.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:90%
I had cancer for four years.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It was lymphoma.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And by that point I had
tumors, some of them

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the size of golf balls,
from the base of my skull

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:84%
all around my neck, under
my arms, in my breasts,

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and all the way
down to my abdomen.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:10%
And I was so sick at
that time that my lungs

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:10%
were always filled with
fluid, because, bear in mind,

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:10%
my condition deteriorated
over a period of four years.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
My body became so weak that I
stopped absorbing nutrition.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I weighed about 85 pounds.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:90%
I was like a skeleton.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:84%
My muscles had all
completely deteriorated.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I could no longer stand up.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:10%
I was either in a
wheelchair or lying down.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But if I lay flat I would
choke on my own fluid

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:84%
because my lungs were
filled with fluid

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and they had to
constantly be drained.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't breathe properly
without the aid of oxygen,

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.410 align:middle line:84%
so I was connected
to an oxygen tank.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had open skin
lesions because my body

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:90%
was just literally--

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the medical
term for it, but when it starts

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
to eat at itself to survive.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But on February
2, 2006, my organs

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
started to finally
shut down one by one.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And I went into a coma.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, the
doctors told my family

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:10%
that these were my final
hours and that I wasn't

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:10%
going to come out of the coma.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
What the people around
me didn't realize,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
though, is that even
though my physical body had

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.420 align:middle line:84%
gone into a coma and I was lying
there on that hospital bed,

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I had left my body before
it had even got so painful.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Because up until
that point, I had

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
been in so much pain,
so much discomfort,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't sleep
because of the fluid.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:10%
But I was so tired
and so uncomfortable,

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:10%
I was completely drugged up.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:10%
And when my organs shut
down, I just left my body.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I left my
body, I felt incredible.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I just felt amazing.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so powerful.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And I felt free.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And the fear was gone.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:10%
I had spent the last four
years in so much fear,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:10%
because I feared cancer,
I feared the treatments

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:10%
of cancer, and I feared death.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was
no way out for me.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And now for the first
time, the fear was gone.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It was just gone.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:10%
And I had never felt
so light before.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I noticed was that
I was surrounded or enveloped

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:84%
in a feeling of
unconditional love.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And unconditional really
means unconditional,

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
because if it's
conditional it's not love.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
unconditional, I mean

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
no matter what I had done in my
life, I wasn't judged for it.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the third
person here to confirm,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
there is no hell
on the other side.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is a hell, that
means that love is conditional.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:90%
So it was truly unconditional.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
being welcomed home.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had
finally come home.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:10%
I had been welcomed
home for all the pain

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:10%
I had been going through.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So much happened while
I was on the other side.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I will be going
deeper into this tomorrow

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:90%
morning at 10:00.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be speaking
about my whole story.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
say here is that I

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
met my deceased father,
who I used to have

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
a turbulent relationship with.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And he told me it
was not my time.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:10%
But no part of me
wanted to come back

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:10%
because my body was so sick
and dying, but in that moment,

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I entered
into a state of clarity

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:10%
where I understood
why I had the cancer.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing
I will share here

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.945 align:middle line:84%
is that I understood
that cancer--

00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
this is very
controversial, but I'm

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
going to say it here--
that cancer is not

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:90%
a physical disease.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We have been conditioned
to treat it only

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
from the physical, but I
understood that it was not--

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:90%
at least not for me--

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:90%
it was not a physical disease.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I understood how all
the thoughts and decisions

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that I had made through
my life had contributed

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to that point of me lying there
on that hospital bed, dying.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that now
that I understood

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.340 align:middle line:84%
what I knew, if I chose to
come back, my body would heal.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And it was at that point
that my dad said to me,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:10%
go back and live
your life fearlessly.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:10%
Now that you know the
truth, now that you

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:10%
know how powerful you are--

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:10%
again, we've been led to
believe that we're not

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:10%
as powerful as we really are,
and that our bodies are not

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:10%
as intelligent and
powerful as they are.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:10%
My dad said, now that
you know the truth,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:10%
go back and live
your life fearlessly.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I came out of the
coma, which I had

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:84%
been in for 30 hours, and
within four days the tumors

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:90%
shrunk by 70%.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Three and a half
weeks later, they

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
could find no trace
of cancer in my body.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Within five weeks I had
enough strength in my body

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to walk and
eat and live my life,

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and so they released
me from the hospital

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:84%
to go home and live
my life cancer-free.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That was on March 9,
2006, 13 years ago.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And here I am today
sharing my story.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Incredible.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are grateful
that you are here

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and that you are all here
to share your journeys,

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
but also to really show us
what this journey of being not

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.420 align:middle line:84%
only on the other side, but
coming back here to live fully,

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to get into that.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I would love it if our
next guest, JC Gordon,

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
could share his story.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:10%
Where his experience, I'm going
to have him share it because it

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:10%
is a little bit shocking--

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:10%
as if no one else's is--

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:10%
a little more, just
to brace yourselves.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And he is now the founder
of the Grail Academy

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:90%
of Higher Consciousness.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Higher consciousness
is truly what

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about here
today, is higher consciousness.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was guided through
his near-death experience

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.920 align:middle line:90%
to the source of all life.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Love to hear about it.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much, Lisa.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Is this on?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Bring it closer-- there you go.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, Lisa.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
My near-death experience
happened after a career

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that I had had in the
banking and financial world.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
only reason for living

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
was to make as much
money as possible

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and to help others to make
as much money as possible.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And on June 25, 1996,
I was semi-retired.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I had built my own log house,
put in my old power system,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
was living off the grid.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was out bucking
some wood with a chainsaw

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:84%
when it suddenly kicked back
and went through my throat.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And the chainsaw ended
up on a white sweat shirt

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:90%
that I was wearing.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And at that very moment,
with the chainsaw still on--

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't turning.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.505 align:middle line:84%
It didn't turn unless
it touched something.

00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had one of the people who
was working on my property come

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:90%
over and turn it off.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment with
the chainsaw still on me,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I audibly heard the
words that said,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:90%
everything's going to be OK.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I have a purpose for your life.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And that led to a--

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
this happened in a remote
area in a small town

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.840 align:middle line:84%
called Bella Coola in
British Columbia, Canada.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There's only about 3,000 people
that live in Bella Coola.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Half of them are native Indians.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.202 align:middle line:84%
It's a very remote
part of the country,

00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and there's only
one hospital there

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and it was a medical outpost.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the gentlemen who
was working for us drove me down

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the highway-- there's
only one road there--

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and someone had called
911 and the ambulance

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:90%
was coming up the other way.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:10%
We were going down
this road this way,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:10%
the ambulance was
coming up this way.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:10%
And Steve pulled the car
off to the side of the road.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:10%
The ambulance pulled
around behind.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:10%
Steve says, just wait here.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody knows me, you
don't tell me just wait here.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.383 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get out.

00:34:26.383 --> 00:34:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:90%
I got out.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.775 align:middle line:84%
I was holding a
compress to my throat,

00:34:30.775 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the
back of the ambulance

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and I met the
ambulance attendant.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And her eyes just
opened up like saucers.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.927 align:middle line:84%
She says to me,
what are you doing?

00:34:41.927 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I want
to go to the hospital.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
Can you take me to the hospital?

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:90%
She says, yes, get in.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:90%
So I got in.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
It was about 20 more
minutes into the hospital.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.603 align:middle line:84%
During that time, she
asked me eight times

00:34:53.603 --> 00:34:55.520 align:middle line:84%
what my name was, because
she thinks I'm going

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.180 align:middle line:90%
to pass out and die on her.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.727 align:middle line:90%
And I get into the hospital.

00:34:58.727 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her as we're
wheeling into the room,

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.977 align:middle line:90%
everything's going to be OK.

00:35:01.977 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it was about 15 minutes
after I was in the emergency

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
room where the doctor
was to my left,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:90%
the nurse was to my right.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden
I'm on top of the room

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking down
at the whole situation.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I saw my throat looked like
raw steak, was just opened up,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:90%
blood was everywhere.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment,
all of a sudden,

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in the
environment of time.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a dimension
that was completely dark.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was in
a rickety elevator.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing this
light that was up at the top.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.495 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the
first star you see.

00:35:42.495 --> 00:35:44.912 align:middle line:84%
You know that first star you
see, and like that twinkling?

00:35:44.912 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just continued
to focus on that.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.655 align:middle line:84%
And as I focused on that, it
got bigger and bigger and bigger

00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
until it was an
all-encompassing light.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.882 align:middle line:90%
And I went through that.

00:35:54.882 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
through that, there

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.415 align:middle line:90%
was this overwhelming peace of--

00:35:59.415 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:90%
as Anita says, I'm home.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm home this is where
my home was and is.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And where I was was on top of--

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:90%
it was like a mountaintop.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a little
nudge on my elbow

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and it led me down the
side of the mountain

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and across a field.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
don't have any body.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just your
spirit that's there.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was moving towards
this castle-type structure.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.570 align:middle line:84%
As I got close to it,
the doors opened up.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I went into it, went up the
stairs, down the hallway.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a library
on the right,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
four entities meditating,
praying on the left.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the last
room on the right hand side.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into that
last room, all of a sudden

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.830 align:middle line:84%
this warmth, this presence
just started to envelop me.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It started to turn itself on.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.890 align:middle line:84%
There were like six
points, and energy came out

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of each of those points, and it
started to communicate with me.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And that communication
was like a telepathic zing

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:90%
that that kind of hit me.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And every time that zing hit
me, I knew what it was saying.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally
taken by Source

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to the events that
happened before time began

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and into the preplanning
stages of time.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And it revealed to me,
from the perspective

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
consciousness, why life is.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And I remember at the--

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was only dead for
two to three minutes,

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like I
was there for months.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It was just so beautiful.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at the
very end of my journey,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to come back.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.227 align:middle line:84%
And Source zinged me and
said you have to go back.

00:37:48.227 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was wrestling with Source.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I said no, I don't
want to go back.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to go back.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't want to go back.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back
and tell all who I am.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And who I am is all of us.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all of us.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And that was my experience.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
my coming-out party.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me 22 years to be
able to put that experience

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
together and be able to explain
it in a succinct, simple way.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But as we heard here, it's
nothing but unconditional love.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
great thought is.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.285 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
universal mind is.

00:38:30.285 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the essence of who we
all are, that's who we all are.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:35.310 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And congratulations for having
this be your coming out.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The characteristics of
the NDE is so beautiful.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's that nobody here wanted
to come back because it was

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful on the other side.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It was so alluring
that coming back here

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
felt like a heavier
experience, and the other

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:90%
was just boundary-less.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And the themes.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has come back
with a complete life change,

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
a complete different journey
than their previous incarnation

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And that exact same
thing has happened

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:90%
with Kimberly Meredith.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Now Kimberly brought back
with her a series of codes

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that she brings through in
blinking her eyes that she

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.890 align:middle line:84%
sees, a trance channel,
essentially, and is

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:84%
able to bring some of the
guidance through with her

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
to actually really, truly,
hands on, heal people.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And her work has been
studied by many institutions

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and she's been featured
on various media outlets

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and I would love for you to
share your story of your NDE.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Lisa
for having me here.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.492 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everybody.

00:39:48.492 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Kimberly.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:84%
My near-death
experience has been

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
quite an experience for
me, still grounding myself

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:90%
with all of it.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It happened just
a few years ago.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And to plainly
put it, which is--

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, I listen to a
lot of people's experiences

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of them have
a lot of similarities.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Mine is interesting, because
I was born with my eyes

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.040 align:middle line:90%
blinking super fast.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And my mom didn't like it.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom thought
I had a disorder.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:90%
So she-- yeah, tick--

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:84%
so she would constantly yell
at me and say stop blinking.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And I loved animals and I loved
rubbing my hands together,

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:04.150 align:middle line:84%
had a beautiful Jewish
grandma and we would pray.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And I always loved God.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, bless
her soul, she died

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:90%
young, had an alcohol problem.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't her,
but she just didn't

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:90%
like me blinking my eyes.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So I forced myself to stop
blinking a very young age.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
feeling sad about it.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And so basically throughout
my life leading up to my NDE,

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
which, who knew
I would have one?

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I knew my hands were different.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I was made fun of at school for
having a lot of lines in it.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say unusual things
like I was reincarnated

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:90%
and I got scolded for that.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And just-- I was odd,
to say the least.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was brought up in a
very interesting home life.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So basically, to
lead up to my NDE,

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in short, it was
pretty hardcore.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I was hit by a car in 2012.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I ended up at Cedars-Sinai.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.740 align:middle line:90%
I coded.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.590 align:middle line:90%
My kidney failed.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I still have a bad kidney.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Praise God, I'm here.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:10%
At the time they told my fiance
I wasn't going to make it.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was put into a
rehab, and in the rehab

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
they told my fiance
I would never walk.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had to have surgery
in the back of my neck

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:90%
through my throat.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I had hematoma, brain bleed.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I was put into
multiple, multiple tests

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and drained my brain,
said I would have

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:84%
epilepsy, seizure
disorder I had.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Came home from the hospital,
excruciating amounts of pain.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking major, major,
like head explosive pain,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:90%
like beyond a migraine.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:21.500 align:middle line:10%
So one day I just decided to
throw all my medication away.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor that was
taking care of me at Cedars

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.605 align:middle line:90%
said you can't do that.

00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:27.405 align:middle line:90%
I said why?

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, you'll die.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to be on that
medication to live.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Your head-- you have to
be on anti-inflammatories.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.070 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I said no, I have to.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But to get back to the NDE,
when I was at Cedars-Sinai

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I did code.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I coded, I
remember looking over

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
at my blood pressure
machine and it just

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:59.030 align:middle line:84%
was like going further
down, down, down, down,

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and then it went out.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And when it was happening, I
didn't know it was happening.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:90%
But I was above myself.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was really cool
because it felt great.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered just
all kinds of confusion,

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.670 align:middle line:90%
looking down at them.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:90%
You can see my arm infiltrated.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And them trying to save me.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side, we say,
where you're transcending,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:84%
it felt super great
and at ease and calm.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And I kept hearing and seeing
this beautiful, wonderful,

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:90%
white light.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And the white light
was pushing on my chest

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.080 align:middle line:84%
super hard where I
couldn't breathe, actually,

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.230 align:middle line:90%
it was so hard.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was blinding my eyes.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
read the Bible, where

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Paul was blinded by the light.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, kind of like that.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying,
get off of me.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
rude to say to God,

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
but it was too much
for me to handle.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time I liked it.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.245 align:middle line:84%
It was like, wow,
this feels amazing.

00:45:16.245 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I was
feeling really sick

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.330 align:middle line:90%
when I was in the hospital.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time I was
like, wow, this is amazing.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I keep hearing,
you're going to stay.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it was
hurting my chest, very heavy.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And my eyes were being
blinded by a light.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was nurses
poking and prodding

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.870 align:middle line:90%
me and doing all these things.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very strange,
interesting thing going on.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.353 align:middle line:84%
I could see myself and
then I was above my head.

00:45:44.353 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
makes sense to you.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like two dynamic things
going on at the same time.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So to make the long
story short, I woke up

00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and I was having lots of shaking
going on through my legs.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.950 align:middle line:84%
My legs were
vibrating and shaking.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know at the time
that it was the Holy Ghost.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Spirit was
going through my legs.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing God
going through my legs.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that
God was telling me

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.190 align:middle line:90%
that you were to stay.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
was happening to me,

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:84%
but I did know that I
had experienced going

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:90%
to another side, because I had.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I was witnessing that.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But when I had to be in the
wheelchair and to recuperate,

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that was not fun.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So like the other people were
saying, when we came back,

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.850 align:middle line:84%
it was like, ugh, because
we're in the third dimension.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up to all of
this, I was like, wow,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:90%
I liked where I just went.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But the energy of God on
my chest and in my eyes

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:90%
was super intense.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> When did you realize that you
had that experience of healing,

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:90%
of the hands on healing?

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.800 align:middle line:90%
By the time I had gotten home--

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
they kept me at Cedars for
a very-- more than a heart

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:90%
attack, by the way.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I was there for so--

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I never thought
I would get home.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.408 align:middle line:90%
I was like, can I go home?

00:47:15.408 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:84%
They kept me there, kept
me there, kept me there,

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:20.540 align:middle line:84%
because my kidney was so
bad and I couldn't walk.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So finally when I
got home and I had

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:31.440 align:middle line:84%
nurses trying to
get me to recover,

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I got rid of my medication.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do it.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
One day I was laying at my
home, I started turning to God

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and praying to God.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I was praying
[SPEAKING HEBREW],, I just

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:84%
kept praying, praying,
praying and asking to God,

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.460 align:middle line:90%
give me an answer.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.460 align:middle line:90%
What am I to do?

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I can't go back to my old life.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:84%
What am I going
to do with myself?

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And my fiance was
like, what are you

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.010 align:middle line:84%
going to do with--
everyone was asking me,

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:02.830 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:03.930 align:middle line:90%
You can't just lay on the couch.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.972 align:middle line:90%
You can't move your neck.

00:48:04.972 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to have surgery.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And one morning I woke
up, my eyes were blinking.

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And you started to
see these experiences.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I started to become
a full-blown medium.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow, absolutely amazing.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's who I was supposed
to be from the beginning when I

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:90%
was a child.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It came out of who I
really was supposed to be.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It changed the entire
trajectory of your life.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Before that I was a medical
consultant on television shows

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and I was a full-blown nurse.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> My goodness.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And I-- it was
totally different things.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I was not a medium, but I
did have abilities, yeah.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a miracle
that I'm here.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we're grateful.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that story.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.385 align:middle line:90%
That was quite the journey.

00:48:55.385 --> 00:48:56.540 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, as I said,
I was going to ask

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.350 align:middle line:84%
a question to the panelists
and have them explain.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- it's an
intricate question,

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and how each person answers it
is really going to truly come

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:90%
from their experience.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I will open
it up to you all,

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to have you ask you your
questions of the panel as well.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go on to
a bit of a journey after that.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a
short visualization

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:84%
meditation that'll help
us access different states

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.070 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.057 align:middle line:84%
So you can really
have a true experience

00:49:29.057 --> 00:49:30.390 align:middle line:90%
by the time you leave this room.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if that wasn't
enough of an experience,

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.180 align:middle line:84%
hearing all these
stories, my goodness.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So my question for you all is,
is this near-death experience

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that you had really going
to a different dimension,

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:84%
or is it accessing a different
state of consciousness

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that we all have the
ability to access?

00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, is it going
to a different dimension, which

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:84%
would really be proof
of different realms

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and dimensions, or is it
accessing and waking up

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:84%
a part of our brain that we
all have access to that we just

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.070 align:middle line:90%
have not yet accessed?

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Dannion

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, dimensions
are another realm.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.850 align:middle line:84%
We are living in those
dimensions anyway.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It's what you focus
on, everybody.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:84%
What you focus on,
like when Anita

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
was describing what
cancer was and how

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the conscious nature
of it as an illness

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:90%
brings itself into play.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.540 align:middle line:90%
It's what you're focusing on.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.090 align:middle line:90%
We all have access, you know?

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows I'm a
big breathing junkie.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:84%
If you come to my lecture
I yell it like 50 times

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:90%
about taking breath.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you pay
attention to your breath

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.682 align:middle line:84%
and you give the preciousness
of that you are breathing,

00:50:50.682 --> 00:50:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you stop for a
moment to pay attention

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to how deep breaths
you're taking

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and realize how shallow
you're breathing,

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:01.250 align:middle line:84%
then you set into motion a whole
series of conscious blocking.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.980 align:middle line:84%
You block yourself from
being able to access

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:90%
levels of conscious.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Think about yogis and
think about Tibetans

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:90%
in deep meditation.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:84%
We are spiritual
beings, and we can't

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:16.370 align:middle line:84%
get all fixated and
caught up into the concept

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.230 align:middle line:90%
that we are here.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Look at how crazy this is.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
How many people think
I'm hitting this table?

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.230 align:middle line:84%
You never touch anything
your entire life.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.180 align:middle line:84%
If you had an
electron microscope,

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that was electrons
particle disbursement.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.420 align:middle line:90%
You never touch anything.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.990 align:middle line:90%
You have never left heaven.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:42.980 align:middle line:84%
You cannot separate
from all things.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You are not capable of
achieving separation

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.750 align:middle line:84%
from the divine nature
of what we call heaven.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.320 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You can only construct a
reality based on emotionally

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:84%
what you're feeling, thinking
about how deep your breath is.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:06.890 align:middle line:84%
You come here and
focus emotionally,

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:84%
breathing, and thinking
about what you're breathing

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.600 align:middle line:90%
is what creates our reality.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So number one, we live in
multidimensional realities.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Number two, we have a
specific purpose and mission

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:26.810 align:middle line:84%
here that we were chosen and
we chose to come to achieve.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.760 align:middle line:10%
You come here-- everybody
wants to know what

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.150 align:middle line:10%
the Big Bang theory, where
we came from, who are we.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll tell you something.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.177 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I care about is
what I'm supposed to do here,

00:52:37.177 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and when I get it done I
want to get the hell out.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And since I have to keep
coming back so often,

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.220 align:middle line:84%
then I need to hurry
up and get it done.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So we are dimensionally
living in a reality

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.676 align:middle line:90%
that we emotionally created.

00:52:49.676 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Beautiful, beautiful.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Kimberly?

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, yes.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.830 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we move in and
out of different dimensions

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.570 align:middle line:10%
and we can choose
whether we want

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.153 align:middle line:10%
to be stuck in a lower third
dimensional world, which

00:53:05.153 --> 00:53:06.570 align:middle line:10%
I believe the
guides are blinking,

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:08.960 align:middle line:10%
no, we don't want us to
live in that 3D world

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.020 align:middle line:10%
anymore, the fear, the
depression, the worry,

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.690 align:middle line:10%
the sickness, and that
we can move into a higher

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.130 align:middle line:10%
dimension, praise God.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
We can be healed in the
fifth dimension and above.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing more
miraculous healings

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.240 align:middle line:90%
in that higher dimension.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And we do have the ability
to be the awakened people.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I for a fact see
and witness every day

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.430 align:middle line:90%
in my office, miracle healings.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:84%
95% of my clients have
cancer, and all of them

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:36.447 align:middle line:90%
are being healed.

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people are being healed.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Cancer's not a bad word anymore.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Immune suppressing illnesses
are not bad anymore.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We are being00 our
brains are powerful.

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:90%
We can be healed.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:90%
We are being healed.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is amazing.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can bounce,
absolutely, to dimensions

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and do different things.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But we have the choice
of absolutely moving

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.570 align:middle line:84%
into the higher dimensions
and having world peace.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:05.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Kelly, different dimensions
or different states

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.820 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I think a little of both.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I was given a year
to live 21 years ago.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the middle of
having a bone marrow transplant

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:90%
when Princess Diana died.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if it was a dream

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.090 align:middle line:84%
or I was in a different
dimension, but it was so real.

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:35.130 align:middle line:84%
She came to me and
we were sitting

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the road,
on probably where she died,

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.220 align:middle line:84%
with like the highway
with the concrete walls.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We were both in Levi's
with white tennis shoes

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.580 align:middle line:90%
with men's button-down shirts.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting next
to me and we had our hands

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.220 align:middle line:90%
on our knees.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.178 align:middle line:84%
And we're just sitting
on the side of the road.

00:54:53.178 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me and
she says, don't worry.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be OK.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Fifi, Dannion.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, was that-- in
what dimension where we in?

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was so real.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't like a
Princess Diana freak.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I loved her and I
thought she was amazing,

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:17.540 align:middle line:84%
but it literally-- it
was the realest moment.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had this-- and
I was on day 17 or 18

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of an autologous stem cell
transplant at Cedars-Sinai.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I was there too.

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I lived there for two months
at a time three times.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.282 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment I
made a promise to God

00:55:33.282 --> 00:55:34.490 align:middle line:90%
when I thought I would croak.

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.260 align:middle line:84%
If he let me live,
I would do whatever,

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.000 align:middle line:90%
and please show me that way.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And boom, I'm back
and on my path.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of a
serial cause person.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what can I do next.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:49.846 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:50.740 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Linda, the psychologist
what do you think?

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I want to say I know,
because I've guided clients

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to experience what NDEs,
what happens during an NDE.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt because
I don't give the client

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:08.660 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They give it to me.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't serve
as a channel, but I

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.770 align:middle line:84%
have some very dear
friends and colleagues

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:90%
who are excellent channels.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But I guide clients
to channel basically

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.700 align:middle line:90%
who they are at the soul level.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- again,
it's what Dannion

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.490 align:middle line:90%
said a couple of minutes ago.

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, when
you're done and you

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:30.980 align:middle line:84%
get done what you
came here to do,

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:34.730 align:middle line:84%
then you're finished
with this lifetime.

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes clients will
come in and they'll say,

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:84%
well, isn't past, present,
and future all the same?

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And in my experiences, no.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.230 align:middle line:84%
We are soul and body, soul,
and spirit at all times.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:90%
We came here with a job to do.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And simplistically and
esoterically, the job

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.950 align:middle line:90%
is to assist humanity to evolve.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's all the same.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.670 align:middle line:90%
We're in body and we are soul.

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:03.210 align:middle line:90%
That's our higher self.

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I got clients to
access not just past lives,

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:07.340 align:middle line:90%
but their higher selves.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.944 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt we're
all of that at one time.

00:57:11.944 --> 00:57:13.156 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:13.156 --> 00:57:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, very good.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting to
get a conclusion here?

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.950 align:middle line:90%
We'll share that in a second.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:27.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Brad and Kasey or
Julius, what is the answer?

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Are we living and accessing
different dimensions

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.520 align:middle line:84%
or different states
of consciousness?

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- we would tell you you
cannot escape the all in being

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.330 align:middle line:90%
the all.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:40.130 align:middle line:90%
That is the truth.

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Escape is an illusion.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It is not an ultimate truth.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.250 align:middle line:84%
You are in all of
those dimensions,

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:84%
all of those realms,
all of those thoughts,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and all of those high
frequencies simultaneously.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.420 align:middle line:84%
What you choose to access
with your focus of thought

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and emotion becomes
your experience.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So the wondrous aspect
of all that you are

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is demonstrated
to you through all

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.820 align:middle line:84%
of the extraordinary
that you choose,

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:12.220 align:middle line:90%
consciously and unconsciously.

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the best news
that we could give you.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.450 align:middle line:90%
So where do you choose to go?

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:20.666 align:middle line:90%
Go everywhere.

00:58:20.666 --> 00:58:21.466 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:21.466 --> 00:58:23.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Super cool, yes, yes.

00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Anita, what do you feel?

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions or states
of consciousness?

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's actually both.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:39.313 align:middle line:90%


00:58:39.313 --> 00:58:41.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it felt for me,
so I'm speaking for myself,

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's in
agreement with what

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.870 align:middle line:90%
everyone else is saying.

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:90%
For me it felt like both.

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I had entered
a different dimension,

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:58.140 align:middle line:84%
but it was in that
dimension that I felt like--

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.470 align:middle line:84%
so the NDE didn't feel
like just an experience

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and then it happened
then and then it's over.

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It was like I walked
through a portal

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and I brought that back with me.

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So while I'm here,
it's a different state

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.330 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But I actually truly
believe that all of us

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:19.890 align:middle line:90%
are able to attain it.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe
that we are born aware

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of that state of
consciousness, but it

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:29.970 align:middle line:84%
gets eroded or conditioned
out of us during our life.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's a state
of consciousness,

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:35.940 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes we have to
go to a different dimension

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.590 align:middle line:84%
to remember that state
of consciousness,

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:40.620 align:middle line:90%
which is who we truly are.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it was a
remembering of who I truly am,

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:48.000 align:middle line:84%
who I was meant to
be, and the purpose

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had intended to
come here to fulfill.

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:56.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And JC, what is your opinion?

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to answer that,
Lisa, if you don't mind,

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:06.970 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of how
I was downloaded while I was

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:07.770 align:middle line:90%
dead.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was from the universal
mind or Source's perspective.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was that
the universal mind is asexual.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It is both male
and it is female.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the male aspect of it is
the great thought of everything

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and a consciousness
of everything

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that is, everything
of everything-ness.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.882 align:middle line:84%
And the female component of
universal mind consciousness

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
is its womb where time resides.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And time is just one
moment of timelessness.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
best way that I can

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
answer that, Lisa,
is that we actually

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.300 align:middle line:90%
have two consciousnesses.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.930 align:middle line:84%
We have a mind
consciousness, which

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is led by our beta frequencies
that is everything out here.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a
heart consciousness,

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
which, when we go inward, we
can resonate with and understand

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
through a theta
frequency understanding.

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
heart consciousness

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
that is actually what our
spirit is communicating

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and how our spirit is
communicating to us.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:08.940 align:middle line:90%
So we can actually be in both.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's our choice,
that we can choose

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
to be in this
horizontal consciousness

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
or we can choose to be
one with our spirit--

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
because our spirit is God--

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to be one with
that consciousness,

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to be one with that
all-knowingness,

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and the work that
we do is we activate

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that universal mind oneness
into us all to make us one

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.590 align:middle line:90%
as the totality of everything.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It's really
remarkable to hear you

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.605 align:middle line:84%
all say basically the same
thing, not knowing each other--

01:01:45.605 --> 01:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're aware of
each other, but not

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:48.438 align:middle line:90%
knowing each other's stories.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
That we truly do have access to
different realms and dimensions

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
based on our states
of consciousness.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And that, yes, we've
all been through trials

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that had to make us
almost die to get

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to that level of awareness,
but beyond a shadow of a doubt

01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:09.775 align:middle line:84%
it is true that everybody
has that ability.

01:02:09.775 --> 01:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I'm always asked
about the near-death experience

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
is do I have to go
through a tragic accident

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to access these
states of consciousness?

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Everyone agree?

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.368 align:middle line:84%
So that you can access these
states of consciousness.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They are available
to all of us, always.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the absolute
truth of what we've all

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
discovered together on
this journey of listening

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to these incredible stories
and journeys of people

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that have been through this.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And so how many
people in the audience

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
have ever been through
a near-death experience?

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And then how many people
also feel that you, too,

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
can access different
states of consciousness

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
or have had that
experience in your life

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.660 align:middle line:90%
without going through a trauma?

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Great, great.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So this is a wonderful group--

01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> And it serves you right.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You all had it coming.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a--

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and you know, this is a group
agreement, essentially you're.

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:08.360 align:middle line:90%
In this room on purpose.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
You've gathered
together as souls

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:13.168 align:middle line:84%
to create one collective
group of consciousness.

01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you came
from or however you

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
decided to get into this
room today or listen

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
on the livestream,
you're here for a reason.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you've found like-minded
souls to connect with

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and to learn from, which really
creates an incredible field,

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
yes?

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts beyond this day,
it lasts through the replays,

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.010 align:middle line:90%
it lasts throughout your life.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you've all chosen
to be here for a reason.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.300 align:middle line:10%
Not only just in
this room, but back

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.600 align:middle line:10%
here on this planet for a
reason, which is absolutely

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.650 align:middle line:10%
a choice.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:42.920 align:middle line:90%
It is a choice.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So whatever complaints we
have in life or challenges

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or difficulties or
death or whatever it is,

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
we made a choice to be here.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And that choice gets to be
lived and played full out.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
No complaining anymore, because
we all chose to be here.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So questions
from our audience.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you have questions?

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a microphone.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this gentleman there
in the orange shirt.

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a question for
any one of our panelists here?

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Just over a question was
I actually died when I was 15

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
for about 30 seconds.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell them how you died.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Had anaphylactic shock
from medication they gave me,

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
cardiac arrest.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:23.955 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember any of it.

01:04:23.955 --> 01:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I just had a
question, any of you

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
guys want to comment on
having a near-death experience

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
but not remembering
anything at all?

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, very common.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Would anyone like
to specifically--

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%


01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Kasey?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.740 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So master, out of body
experiences are extremely

01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
emotional for most,
extremely emotional.

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
For some, in their
physical experience,

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
it is the most emotional
connective experience

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
thus far in their
physical lives.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
For some, that emotion
is overwhelming.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Overwhelming.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And so some will
choose to not remember

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.480 align:middle line:90%
or not to engage once again.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We assure you that
your experience

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.780 align:middle line:90%
is one of expandability.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Expandability.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to decipher
your experience in order

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to choose to expand
from an experience.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
That is a truth.

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Just choose expansion,
master, expansion.

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And then your experience
is living out its truth

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:42.640 align:middle line:90%
of its demonstration for you.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would recommend that
you follow up with Linda.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're truly trying--
and I'm agreeing with what

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
she just said.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
If it's not necessary
for you to remember

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that conscious movement
in your plan of action,

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and that it does,
like a lot of us,

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
take us off on complete
different patterns.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I would say that you are
on your pattern of where

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.220 align:middle line:90%
you are going to go.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But I would encounter someone
like Linda, who's conscious--

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
not just any
regression therapist,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.560 align:middle line:90%
but somebody as cool as she is--

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I would make contact and
go through a process that

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
would help you remember
that to see if it had value,

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
if it's so meaningful for
you to have that experience.

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, like
Kasey said, what happens

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is it's not necessary for you
to recall that information.

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Mine is, I'm just hard at it.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.832 align:middle line:90%
And if you kill me once, OK.

01:06:40.832 --> 01:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But after you kill me
two or three times,

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I get really smart.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you just smart
enough that you didn't really

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:50.667 align:middle line:90%
need to access that knowledge.

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also Raymond
Moody's wonderful website,

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Life After Life, and it
lists the characteristics

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.115 align:middle line:90%
of a near-death experience.

01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:58.073 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
how I realized I had one,

01:06:58.073 --> 01:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
is when I was interviewing him.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at these
characteristics.

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had this incredible crack
open of consciousness, saying,

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
my god, I experienced that.

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got to sit
with him around that, which

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
was an incredible experience.

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But he's got it all listed
on lifeafterlife.com.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful service.

01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:17.610 align:middle line:90%
All right, questions?

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:18.492 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

01:07:18.492 --> 01:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't see because there's
this this blinding light.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, right here in
the front of the room.

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Gina?

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.170 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't know if
someone can answer this.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I have out of body
experiences but I

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:34.240 align:middle line:90%
don't encounter the divine.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I just get out
of my body and I explore.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So how is that different,
if it is different at all?

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%


01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I'll dive into that.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
My sense is you're
experiencing what

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:49.470 align:middle line:90%
you need to be experiencing.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And we're all divine.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you're out
of your body, you're

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:57.720 align:middle line:90%
tapping into your divine nature.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what
happens as humans is we

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
start putting things in boxes.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Like why isn't it this way?

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
It should be-- I should
be tapping into God.

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
My sense is you're
experiencing exactly what you

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:13.080 align:middle line:90%
need to be experiencing.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.180 align:middle line:90%
You can ask to experience more.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
When you get in bed
or when you meditate

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you do to
step out of your body,

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
ask to experience more.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.979 align:middle line:10%
Those decisions are
made at the soul level,

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:29.346 align:middle line:10%
at the higher
self, divine level.

01:08:29.346 --> 01:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I have something funny to
say about that, if that's OK.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:39.627 align:middle line:84%
So I spent most of my
life out of my body.

01:08:39.627 --> 01:08:41.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:47.819 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
I would pray and feel very

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%
interesting, a lot of anxiety.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you mean, too,
like out of the body feeling?

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:59.069 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and I wasn't big on
meditating or all that,

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
but just throughout
my life, regular girl,

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
feeling kind of out
of body anxiety.

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd be hiking and just kind
of felt interesting sometimes,

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.649 align:middle line:90%
like tingly.

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone here feel that
sometimes, anxiety, stuff

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
like that?

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And the most interesting
thing, after I had the NDE I

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
feel so in my body now.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.979 align:middle line:90%
It's like who I really am now.

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:26.609 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any anxiety at all.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:27.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm home.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.029 align:middle line:90%
And let me finish about that.

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Because now that
I'm truly who I am,

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
why would you think
I have no anxiety?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm connected
100% to the divine god.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.069 align:middle line:90%
Now I am me.

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm really me.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:50.029 align:middle line:90%
But who is me?

01:09:50.029 --> 01:09:53.550 align:middle line:84%
When I say my name Kimberly,
they give me a negative blink.

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Am I Kimberly?

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Who are we, really?

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.490 align:middle line:90%
So our name is our name.

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.930 align:middle line:90%
But so what I'm trying to get--

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm getting a
little deep here--

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.400 align:middle line:90%
but she's right.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So finding this energy,
your connection,

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
your deep connection
to the holy one, God--

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and I know I keep
talking about God a lot.

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's very interesting when
you really think about it,

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions, the
consciousness, and like Anita

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.180 align:middle line:90%
said, consciousness dimensions.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It's all related and knowing how
strong our faith is with God,

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:32.470 align:middle line:90%
and I'll leave it at that.

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And where we're all going with
that, and our love for that,

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:37.913 align:middle line:90%
and God is love.

01:10:37.913 --> 01:10:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And love is all there is.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Love is all there is.

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:43.605 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll start
singing the Beatles now.

01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:46.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Any other questions about--

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.492 align:middle line:90%
right next to you, Gina.

01:10:50.492 --> 01:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Gina Salvati, ladies
and gentlemen,

01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the amazing executive
producer of The Aware Show.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.460 align:middle line:90%
She's right there.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> On that note, someone told
me today and I'm wondering now.

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Can dark energies
attached to people, then,

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
or can you overcome that by
just believing in who you are?

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Or do you need
assistance to overcome

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.520 align:middle line:90%
that with somebody else?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.490 align:middle line:90%


01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion can
answer that question.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Depends on the
definition of a dark energy.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I never believed in
ghosts or anything

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
like that after being
dead a couple of times.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And then in the third
near-death experience

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
the structure changed.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And this place I thought
was the transitional place,

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you lift out of your body, you
acclimate to what's around you,

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
you see the world
that you just left,

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a level
of consciousness

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
where you're acclimating
to who you are.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw a place that I
call the blue gray place

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
because I got captivated
by discarded spirits.

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Once you're chosen,
once you are chosen

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and you choose to
come here, nobody

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to tell you
when you have to leave.

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
The fact that somebody
"dies", quote, unquote,

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they have
to leave this dimension

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or this level of consciousness
I call the blue gray place.

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So alcoholic spirits-- you
know, that's why they call it

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
spirits--

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
drug addicts, they can stay.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
They can't stay long,
but they can stay.

01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
As thin as the veil is-- because
we have entered the new age,

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
the Aquarian age, or this
next cycle, we've entered it--

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
the veil is so thin it's easy,
based on perpetual concepts

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and thought patterns to
allow not a possession,

01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
but an attachment.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.670 align:middle line:10%
To give a dimensional level
trapped in-- a not trapped,

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.880 align:middle line:10%
but holding themselves--
in that place to attach.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.840 align:middle line:84%
If you feel that
you are attached,

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or you feel you
know someone who is,

01:12:57.350 --> 01:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I think another regression
is necessary for that person

01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:01.970 align:middle line:90%
so they get past it.

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Or you get them to see
what they're pondering.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.300 align:middle line:84%
What you're continuously
obsessing over in your thought

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.140 align:middle line:84%
patterns allows that
energetic pattern

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in that place to reconnect.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So many of those people in
that dimension feel betrayed,

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:22.520 align:middle line:90%
dishonored, disrespected.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
They're addicted to drugs,
alcohol, narcissism.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
All the I, I, I, me, me, me
things we used to rationalize.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you sense that that
place is there or with somebody

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:39.020 align:middle line:84%
you love, get them to talk about
what they're worrying about

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and see what is repetitious.

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:44.690 align:middle line:10%
Because in that repetition
there comes that place.

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And every night when I
stop and do my life review,

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
for all those beings that I
saw trapped in that world,

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I give that moment.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I created the Twilight
Brigade for dying veterans

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
because when I was
on the other side,

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
so many veterans are betrayed.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
They're in prisons,
and now that we--

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Vietnam guy.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And now that we've seen
Kissinger's papers,

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.790 align:middle line:10%
after we know that they left
928 Americans in captivity.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the Kissinger papers
that released three years ago.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And we know we left those
guys and they feel betrayed.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go in a VA hospital,
you can see that kind of place.

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And they stay trapped
because if you

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
were a child abused by
a priest, why would you

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.230 align:middle line:90%
want to go down that tunnel?

01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
you're thinking.

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Or alcohol.

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.600 align:middle line:90%
So we hunt what's repetitious.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I came out from that
third experience

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and I created the
Twilight Brigade.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And I needed veterans to be able
to go, to did not get trapped.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So I have more quote,
unquote, "dead" friends

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.320 align:middle line:90%
than I have living friends.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.032 align:middle line:84%
And most of the dead
friends like me.

01:14:57.032 --> 01:14:59.150 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, which is a stretch.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So I have guys on both
sides of the veil.

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a veteran, I can
send somebody back across.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And someone who is in that same
pattern of feeling betrayed,

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that light lights up
and then that person

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:16.820 align:middle line:90%
takes them on across.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So there is a level
of consciousness

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of people who
have frightening near-death

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
experiences or they all went
to "hell", quote, unquote,

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.280 align:middle line:10%
There is a level
of consciousness

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.800 align:middle line:10%
that we can trap ourselves
by holding on the I,

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.430 align:middle line:10%
I, I, me, me, me.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And that allows
that level of energy

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:41.820 align:middle line:10%
to find a harmonic vibratory
frequency equal to what you are

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.360 align:middle line:10%
repetitively working through
to be able to harmonize

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.750 align:middle line:10%
in that frequency, and it's not
about you they're attaching to.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.670 align:middle line:10%
It's about getting
back over here

01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:53.490 align:middle line:10%
to keep going back through
that same endless cycle

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:57.030 align:middle line:10%
of whatever it was
they felt or repressed

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:58.470 align:middle line:10%
or didn't get through.

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.500 align:middle line:10%
And what you're doing is,
you have two friends that's

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.790 align:middle line:10%
personalities are changing.

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They're like these
two people that you

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
believe to be not
possessed, but there's

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.650 align:middle line:90%
something changing in them.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching the two
different personalities-- am I

01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You're watching the two
different personalities

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
involved.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
One is an attachment and the
other is an attention-getter.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Remembered, one of
them has an attachment.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an obsession compulsive
nature that's reacting there.

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
The other is using those
patterns to get attention.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to betray anybody,
but just keep that in mind.

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating, fascinating.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And Anita, if you have something
to say around self-love that

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
really helps with those
types of darker energies

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and how really, truly
blinding self-love is?

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I loved Dannion's
explanation just now as well.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So my perception of dark
energies is actually very--

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I completely agree
with what he said.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I tend
to tell people, I

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.580 align:middle line:84%
started out by telling
people that I don't believe

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
in dark energies because
when I crossed over

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.410 align:middle line:90%
there was no darkness.

01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
There were no dark energies.

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody who's
negative or evil

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.620 align:middle line:90%
trying to get us over here.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:28.400 align:middle line:84%
However, because of the number
of people that have told me,

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
no, but I have felt it,
I have felt dark energies

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
or scary energies, what
I have come to realize

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, when there are
people who first cross over,

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
they're are still attached to
the emotions from this side.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And if they have had or
experienced a lot of darkness

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
on this side, then
that is what we're

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
picking up on when we
are near those spirits.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
However-- and this is the part--

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
what we pick up on is only
a mirror or a reflection

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
of where we are.

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why it's
so important for you

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
to feel that--

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.140 align:middle line:90%
for you to love yourself.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
For you to always shine
the light on yourself.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
For you to always
uplift yourself.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
about the dark energies.

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I tend to tell people you
don't have to go for exorcism.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is uplift
yourself, love yourself more,

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
find your own joy, your own
happiness, your own purpose.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
When you are on a
higher frequency,

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.370 align:middle line:84%
you're not even going to be
touched or affected by them.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So we don't even need
to think about them.

01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't like
to put the focus on them,

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like
people to think they

01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
need to fear dark energies.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Because that fear
itself puts you

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency where
you start to sense them.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why the divine kept
sending us back now, Anita.

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
That God was looking around and
she says, hey, wait a minute.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
between me and a doctor

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is God never thinks
she's a doctor.

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking at
the fact that death--

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.250 align:middle line:90%
we live in a chemical universe.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.320 align:middle line:90%
That means it's a dead universe.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.070 align:middle line:84%
If you take a medicine
or you getting

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
healed through
allopathic medicine,

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.240 align:middle line:90%
that's a dead universe.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.730 align:middle line:10%
All you are is chemistry
and brain reactions.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:27.140 align:middle line:10%
You really don't love anything.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.950 align:middle line:10%
It's just chemical reactions.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.370 align:middle line:10%
It's like Anita said,
where you are is

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.050 align:middle line:10%
you're in the living universe.

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:35.760 align:middle line:10%
So she was looking down
and she said, you know?

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to send some
of them SOBs back,

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and who are they
going to blame ?

01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The doctors are to blame for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.940 align:middle line:90%
for us coming back.

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So all of us who
come back and express

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a living
universe gives the doctors

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:54.260 align:middle line:90%
something they have to disavow.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I was in the hospital--

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the hospital they
brought me in when

01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I was struck by
lightning in 1975,

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Raymond Moody was
a medical student.

01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I met Raymond.

01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
He lived about four
miles from-- well,

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:12.260 align:middle line:84%
eight miles from where I lived,
and we became fast friends

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s as I watched
him get destroyed

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
by the medical community.

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Get destroyed for bringing
this incident out.

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So remember, the divine--

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and the most important
thing about everything

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
we're listening to is
your sense of humor.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The moment that you
lose your sense of humor

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
about whatever's
happening, you've

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
lost control of your identity
of this dimensional reality.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We are loving, kind,
playful beings.

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:46.580 align:middle line:10%
That's who we are
and what we are.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.950 align:middle line:10%
And we are eternal and forever.

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.940 align:middle line:10%
Why do you think we get
these little short time jobs?

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.130 align:middle line:90%
We won't take a long job.

01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%
What's 80 years?

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's 78.4 years is the
average life expectancy here.

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
What's that to eternity?

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Get your job done, everybody.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Is definitely a different time,
I'll share just a quick story,

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.470 align:middle line:84%
but I recently interviewed
Raymond Moody on the Gaia show,

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.180 align:middle line:90%
on Inspirations.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And it shocked me.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
My interview with him
completely shocked me,

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
because I asked him about
his work and research

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
with the near-death
experience, and I honored him

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
for really bringing that term
to our world and our community.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me he
wish he'd never done it.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
He said he didn't
believe a thing he said.

01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
beautifully honest when

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
he said that to me, because
it was a burden for him.

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
He lost all his money.

01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
He went--

01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> His wife, his family.

01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge cross
to bear for Raymond.

01:21:57.290 --> 01:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I share that is
because it is a different time

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
now, where those pioneers paved
the way for this conversation

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.650 align:middle line:90%
to even happen today.

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:11.330 align:middle line:90%
And to be here today.

01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And I watched Raymond from
a very personal point of view.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have known
Raymond 40 years.

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I've known Raymond 43 years.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.740 align:middle line:90%
I spent 20 years with Raymond.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't have
a near-death experience.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.730 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have it.

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was watching
and listening to people

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.570 align:middle line:90%
describe these experiences.

01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I met Raymond, he
asked the right questions.

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:40.117 align:middle line:90%
This is 1976, everybody.

01:22:40.117 --> 01:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> As if he had had one himself.

01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
He knew the right
questions to ask.

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote-- and
I'll be honest,

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "Saved By The Light"
because I had open heart

01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
surgery, and Raymond--

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.825 align:middle line:84%
I was not going to
have the surgery.

01:22:52.825 --> 01:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Number one I wasn't
going to have

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
the surgery because the
surgeons came in and the bastard

01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
had the biggest hands
I've ever seen in my life.

01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:00.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.172 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about them opening

01:23:02.172 --> 01:23:04.190 align:middle line:84%
my chest and that
big-handed bastard digging

01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
around inside me, so I
wasn't going to have it.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So my dad called Raymond
and Raymond came and Raymond

01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
said, please stay and help me.

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So I took about a
year and I got over it

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and I went to see Raymond.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Raymond was in the house.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.710 align:middle line:84%
He had no electricity,
no running water,

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and he was beaten.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.320 align:middle line:90%
He had now lost everything.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
He'd lost his wife, his
family, his medical license

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.480 align:middle line:90%
was in jeopardy.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was attacking him.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "Saved By The Light"
because I needed people

01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to pick on somebody
their own size.

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd had enough of it.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I realized how many
people had no voice.

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And either you told
somebody that you'd

01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:49.552 align:middle line:84%
had this experience in
1975 and '76 and '77,

01:23:49.552 --> 01:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
they told you that
was something you need

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to talk to your minister about.

01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
If you tell your
minister, they said

01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
that was somebody you needed
to talk to your doctor about.

01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And nobody had any place to go.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:07.603 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, OK, well,
let them come jump on me.

01:24:07.603 --> 01:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you
Google the term now,

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
there's literally millions
and millions of pages

01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
on the near-death experience,
which people like Raymond Moody

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:15.740 align:middle line:90%
paved the way for.

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Coined the phrase.

01:24:16.615 --> 01:24:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, for all of us.

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember the first--

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We get to have this
conversation now because

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of people like that, and we
get to share these experiences.

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
How lucky are we, that we get
to even have this conversation?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to have you
give a big, huge hand

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and welcome and great gratitude
for our wonderful panel here.

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:38.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots of
love to our panel,

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.307 align:middle line:84%
and thank you all so
much for joining here.

01:24:44.307 --> 01:24:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like
to ask any questions

01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
we'll be around
for a little while.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
If anything, you're
energized and you're freed up

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:52.160 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of this day.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Have a great day.

01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Lisa Garr.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.150 align:middle line:90%
