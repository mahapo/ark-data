[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, welcome, everyone,
and especially everyone online

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to what's going to be a very
special, extremely fascinating,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and deeply informative
experience here at Conscious

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Life Expo on the cutting-edge
topic of Ascension NOW!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And you are very fortunate
to have gotten yourself

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
into the room right
now, or online,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
because this will be some very
evolutionary and revolutionary

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
information that can be
very valuable to you.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And we all know there's a major
shift happening on the planet.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty obvious.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason why we're
here converging at the expo

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's going on.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And this presentation
is about that.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this shift
continue to escalate

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:90%
more and more each time.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from the
perspective of just looking

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
in the news, it's
hard to see this

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
as a positive transformation,
because there's

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of stuff happening.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
We can see the major
corruption happening.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
We see the dysfunction
in the world.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We see the duality
really clearly.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Even yesterday on
the news, it was

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
broadcast R Kelly being
arrested for sexual abuse,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and even the Cardinals
in the Catholic religions

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
are now admitting that
documents have been destroyed

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:90%
that documented sexual abuse.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So all this transparency is
coming up to the surface.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, these are high-sign
times of this transformation

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Because just like when
our body goes into--

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
we need to heal from
something in our body,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and we go through
a healing crisis.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
What happens, we get
sick a little bit first.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the toxins are
coming up to the surface.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
So they can be eliminated.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, you build a whole new
healthy foundation of health

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to build.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's going
on with the planet.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So this planetary evolution
is very similar to what's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
going on in the inside here.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We know of the spiritual
principle-- as above so below.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on on a
planetary global level

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is all connected to what's
going on an inner level.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So I say there's a
great opportunity here

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
for accelerated spiritual
transformation that's

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:90%
happening on the planet now.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening
at all levels.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I know, for me, this
is one of the things

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that I'm extremely
excited about.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of
perceptible experience

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I would assume some
of you in this room

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and online also have this inner
knowing of this accelerated

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
spiritual transformation
happening now

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in your life and perceptible
experience about that.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, OK,
so what's going on?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:90%
What is this process?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we're defining this
accelerated spiritual process.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on
for a long time,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like,
even since 2012,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
there's been an escalation
of the shit coming up

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to the surface and
transformation in your life,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
major transformation
in your life.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're
going to be addressing here.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I
think it's amazing.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, like
me, you also feel

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's why you came
to the planet right now,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
for this accelerated spiritual
transformation that's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
happening globally,
galactically,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:90%
and within our being.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I call it "showtime," where
everything's happening.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we came here for
this spiritual evolution

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to experience
and we're experiencing now.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So ascension has become a meme
for this spiritual quickening.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
transfiguration we're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:90%
talking about at all levels.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a graduation of
the planetary system

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and of ourselves to the next
level of functioning and being.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm personally
dedicated to, and what I love,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm pursuing.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
My name is Debra
Giusti, and I'm hosting

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
this panel of amazing guides
who are here to teach you.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
additional evolutions

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that things are changing
is, things are positively

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
As we know, women now,
with the MeToo movement,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
are coming into their
power, coming into--

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
allowing the feminine
principle to be

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
part of our whole
structure again,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:90%
to bring it into balance.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
As we know, we have five women
running for president now,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
which is amazing,
including Marianne

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Williamson, our beloved
spiritual teacher

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and political activist.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you see here, we
have five incredible women

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and one amazing
man on the panel.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is also a demonstration
of the feminine coming

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:90%
into power.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only women, it's
the feminine principle, which

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
brings in the higher
levels of nurturing,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and intuition, and all
those other functioning

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:90%
that we're evolving into.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it's
definitely a very personal

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
spiritual process, like I said,
really escalated after 2012.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the
things that I'm experiencing

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:90%
that we'll be talking about.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
What I'm experiencing is this
is an embodied experience.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.603 align:middle line:84%
This is not like ascending
and leaving the planet,

00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:84%
dying, going somewhere
else and sending.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.312 align:middle line:90%
That's a different level.

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's an embodied experience that
you're having of shifting up

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:90%
to the higher levels.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I now meditate every
day, non-negotiable,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and this came to me at 2012.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to tune
into spirit and allow

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that to sync up every day,
like brushing your teeth.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I get downloads all
the time, whether it's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
energetic frequencies,
whether it's messages,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:90%
whether it's just intuition.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a part of
the new functioning

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:90%
that's happening now.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity is a piece
of what's happening now,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
where things will
show up and they're

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
just perfect for what
you're manifesting.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Now it may always
have been there,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but my awareness is heightened
now that I can tune into that

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and really use that
for my functioning.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Healing-- core healing--

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about core
dysfunctional healing

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:90%
is really important.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've been called
to do that in my life.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't heal it,
it comes up really strong

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
as another huge
message in my reality.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Raising my frequency is
another very important thing.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:90%
And this means at all levels.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm very committed to my diet--

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
so I'm eating the right
things for my body--

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.858 align:middle line:84%
to my movement, and
breath, to my thoughts,

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:84%
my positive thoughts,
everything that

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
keeps your frequency
at a high level.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:10%
Major life transitions,
you gotta be

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:10%
willing to go with the change--

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:10%
things that are lower and
not functional in my life,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:10%
including people, businesses,
anything, are going away.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And the new higher
functions are coming in.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Connection with higher self.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There is new levels of my
being, including higher self,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
the merkaba, other
parts of my being,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that I'm becoming--
have a relationship with

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and living from the heart
and the higher self instead

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:90%
of just the mind and the body.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And personal relationship
with spiritual guides--

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been called to have
very personal relationships

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
ascended masters

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and have them support
me and work with me.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of what
can happen at the new levels

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're moving towards.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And understanding
multi-dimensional realities--

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
the concept of operating
at fifth dimensional level

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
or even higher dimensions
is all part of it.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And divine mission--
really being

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
on what you came here to
do, no messing around,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
really being following
that inner voice that says,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're
supposed to do this,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's raising
children, or creating

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
a new business that's going
to revolutionize the world.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's following your
divine mission.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And connecting with
soul tribe, which

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
is what we do here at
the Conscious Life Expo,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
with likeminded people who
have the similar mission, who

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
can all connect and
really understand

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
this spiritual escalation
that's happening now.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming all
this may be true for you

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:90%
and various levels of it.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
here to talk about.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have an amazing
panel who have all

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
had personal experience, and
they're all guides and teachers

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
in their own level of this
spiritual escalation happening

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to start with--

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I would like the
panelists to share

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
their personal
interpretation of ascension

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:90%
and their personal experience.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like the six
men and the elephant--

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:90%
six blind men and the elephant.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It's this big conversation
of experience.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And we all have our
own experience of it.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to ask them--
and keep its succinct--

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:90%
no more than four minutes--

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
what your experience of
this accelerated process

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is personally and
how you define it.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm first going to
acknowledge Tracey Ash.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:90%
She is an ascension teacher.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And she goes all over the
world to sacred sites,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and brings people there, and
uses the energetic activation

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred sites to bring
forth the ascension energies

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Amazing teacher,
amazing light being.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.206 align:middle line:84%
And Tracey Ash, would you
like to share with us?

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It's gorgeous to be here
and be in your presence.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:10%
Ascension, for me, is
everything at this time

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:10%
that needs to happen for
the planet, our planet.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:10%
So ascension, opening
the star gates,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:10%
the contact, the
legitimate contact

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:10%
that comes with real and
genuine sacred processes,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:10%
real and genuine
ascension processes--

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:10%
so legitimate
ascension experiences,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:10%
legitimate sacred destiny,
activation, and awakening--

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:10%
and then taking us
through the corridors,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:10%
the gateways of initiation--

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:10%
high-frequency gateways,
transdimensional gateways

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:10%
that are massively grounded
and embodied in our reality,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:10%
and in our being,
and in our biology

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:10%
so that it changes who we are
at every, every level of being.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm an experiencer.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I fuse ascension and
contact combined.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
My experiences with contact,
UFO fleets, extraterrestrials

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:90%
has been documented by CSETI.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the way that I
bridge ascension with research,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:90%
that's what I do.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:10%
I am also a teacher-trainer.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I train people to step
into ultimate possibilities

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
of sacred destiny.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:10%
And that means living the
reality, not just 3D dimension,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:10%
or talking about it,
and referencing it.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So I gather the tribe who
is on the same page in terms

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
of saving the planet,
saving humanity.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And I return individuals
to their sovereignty,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to their sacred destiny,
and to the memories of that.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm capable of traveling
with you on your timelines

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and reading your original
sacred contracts.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
That is fascinating
stuff when it

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
comes to this overhaul of
consciousness and frequency,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
where we must look to the
wound, the false matrix

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
programming, the density
of the filter that distorts

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
our sovereignty
here on the planet

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and the density of the
filter that distorts us truly

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
manifesting this dream of
sacred and sovereign earth

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and humanity.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:10%
So in terms of the
contact that I have,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:10%
the channelings that have come
from the extraterrestrials that

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:10%
are aiding the work
that I do, I mean,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:10%
I mobilize large groups, large
gatherings with my husband.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
He has zen awakening
festival in Florida,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and we're just about to do
avatars of the Earth gathering

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
at Shasta.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is about contacts.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It's about the stargates.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's about the earth grid.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about working
with kindred souls, who

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:84%
are going to flick your
switch in terms of ascension.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Tracey.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.245 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And Meg Benedicte is one
of the top ascension teachers

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%
nationally.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
She had an experience of a
Kundalini awakening in LA

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
during the Northridge
earthquake,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
where Metatron
came to her and has

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
been a primary guide
for downloading all

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:90%
the technologies for ascension.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
She's my personal
ascension teacher.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.222 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to know your
perspective on ascension,

00:14:01.222 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:90%
whatever you'd like to share.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Debra.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so ascension--
this awakening process

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
can happen very gradually
over months and years.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But then, for some of us, it can
just be in a matter of seconds.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what it was
for me during the Northridge

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:90%
earthquake.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It, in a sense, blew
open all the circuits.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And I had my angelic soul be
able to come into the body,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:10%
walk in, and see through
a whole new perspective,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:10%
be able to kind of determine and
see where we are locked down,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:10%
where the time barriers
and the density

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:10%
was creating in a sense,
like a mental amnesia.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
unlocks, then everything

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
starts to become very
clear and immediately

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
had the channel to my higher
self to get the steps,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:90%
get the guidance.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
How do I, in a sense, get free
of this prison of my density

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and the three-dimensional time
matrix consciousness that's

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
running in all of us,
creating fear, and duality,

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
and separation?

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So as this all began
to unravel and unlock,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to be able to
go through this process we're

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
doing, which is called
"soul embodiment."

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.875 align:middle line:84%
And we have to actually raise
our frequency to do this.

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You think about
it, you're trying

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to get your soul
like into a rock.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:90%
That's how dense we are.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So as we increase our frequency,
it helps our awakening.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
When you go higher
and higher frequency,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it begins to dissolve that time
barrier and the amnesia that's

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:84%
been running in
us for centuries.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I call it an ascension
of frequency.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It's also an ascension
of your chakra pillar,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
as you start to clear the trauma
and the density out of each

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
of your chakras,
you begin to access

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
more and more higher
dimensional reality

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
that we were locked from.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:10%
So it's very much of
a freeing experience

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:10%
and a liberating experience.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And it opens you to, in a
sense, universal knowledge

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And you start to bring the soul
presence into your biology.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:90%
This is a game-changer.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:90%
This starts to change your DNA.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It starts to awaken the
dormant multidimensional DNA.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:10%
It starts to open up your
energy body or merkaba torus,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:10%
so that you can actually
travel through time and space

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:10%
and be able to access other
universes and dimensions.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's exponentially
an ascension process

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
into really living
your full potential,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
being all that you are, where we
came from such a limited state

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:90%
to being divine.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe we are
becoming divine humans,

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:10%
so this is an
extraordinary time to be

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:10%
on the planet to be able to
experience this right now.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Meg.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:90%
How clear.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And Lori Spagna is another
amazing ascension teacher.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:84%
She's a best-selling
author and visionary.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
She provides activations online.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's been on the
panels almost every year.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
her perspective as well.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.562 align:middle line:10%
So Lori, share with
us what you can.

00:17:18.562 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, thanks, Debra.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.978 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, everyone
for being here.

00:17:20.978 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm super excited
about our panel today.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:10%
So, again, my name
is Lori Spagna.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:10%
And for more than
20 years, I've been

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:10%
assisting humans and animals
to come into alignment

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:10%
with divine source and to embody
divine source consciousness

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:10%
through this process of
awakening, attunement,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:10%
and alignments, and just to
answer the question directly.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:10%
Part of my journey was
that almost 15 years ago, I

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:10%
was living in Maui and I had
what you call an induction

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:10%
experience, or at least
that's what I call it,

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:10%
where my home star family
had a reunion with me,

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and I was brought onto
a ship experience,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:10%
a first-contact
type of experience.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:10%
And I was activated--
and all kinds

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:10%
of what I would call downloads,
rewiring of my consciousness.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It took me many years to
start to really understand

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and integrate what that
was and what that was for.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:10%
And, ultimately, I
became very clear

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:10%
that it was about this
ascension timeline

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:10%
that we're now all
living in that's

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:10%
designed to help us to wake
up out of what we've called

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:10%
a third dimensional
consciousness, where we've been

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:10%
in separation, where we've
believed ourselves to be

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:10%
separate from one another,
and from source, and from all

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:10%
that is.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:10%
And this evolutionary
process that's

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:10%
going on that we call ascension,
for all of humanity, which

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:10%
is now well underway and,
at the same time in its very

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:10%
early infant stages--

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:10%
is requiring us to all uplevel.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I do.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Through that integration,
I came to start

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
that was how I was

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:90%
going to serve and contribute.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:10%
And also, a huge
part of what I do

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:10%
is working with animals
and the animal kingdom

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:10%
and their consciousness.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:10%
Because they, of course, are
here to assist us as well.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they're
consciousness is quite evolved.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And as we come into
learning from them--

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.925 align:middle line:84%
that's what I had to
learn, to learn from them--

00:19:11.925 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that they're here
with a divine mission

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to assist us in our
awakening process as well.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to briefly
say that the way that I

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:10%
do it is to help people
and their animals

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:10%
identify those aspects
of our unconscious--

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:10%
the programs, the implants--

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:10%
maybe negative alien implants--
we can use that word "negative"

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:10%
because they're
nonbeneficial to us--

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:10%
the belief systems,
et cetera, that we're

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:10%
unconscious of, that keep
us stuck, and hooked into,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:10%
and anchored into this old
third-dimensional paradigm that

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:10%
is now, we can see, collapsing.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
first things we do.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we also-- as we
identify them, we remove them

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and resolve them, provide
the gifts of consciousness.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:10%
That's an integration,
downloads,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:10%
activation process
that up levels

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.203 align:middle line:10%
us into higher frequencies
of consciousness.

00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:10%
And then the next
thing we also do

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:10%
is anchor into this new
fifth-dimensional reality,

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:10%
which is based in energies and
frequencies of peace; and joy;

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:10%
and love; and consciousness;
and unity; connection to source,

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:10%
and one another,
and all that is.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And through that process
for humans and animals,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
that's how I am
assisting humanity

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.473 align:middle line:84%
in this evolutionary experience
that we're undergoing together.

00:20:26.473 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
One other piece I want to
say that the overall why--

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that all of
us have this sacred mission

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and purpose--

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is to eliminate and eradicate
all forms and experiences

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of suffering and separation
as well as all forms

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and experiences associated with
pain that we no longer need

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to recreate or re-experience
because we're done

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
and complete with it.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:10%
And then the restoration
of alignment and attunement

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:10%
with this divine source--

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and this intimate relationship
with our union and reunion

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:10%
with sacred connection
with that source,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:10%
however we understand
and embody it.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:10%
So to me, this is the big
why, why we're all here

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:10%
on planet Earth at this
time, and we're all

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.735 align:middle line:10%
finding our own unique path
and journey within that.

00:21:13.735 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that helps.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.615 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:21:17.615 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And Maureen St Germain is also
an amazing ascension teacher.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
She specializes in
really guiding people

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to
live in 3D reality.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:90%
She's an author and speaker.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
She's an Akashic Records
Guides founder and someone

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I also follow and appreciate.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So, Maureen, tell
us your perspective.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that we're
all becoming ascended masters.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:10%
And so the 3D is the
person we think we are.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And the ascended master,
5D, is who we are becoming.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And we are all becoming this
evolved version of ourself.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
have this evolved version

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of ourself already living
in the fifth dimension.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is unifying
ourselves with ourselves.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is why my guides
and angels have taught me

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are remembering who we
are instead of trying to be.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you decide to
remember who you are,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
you give yourself permission
to be something that you

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:90%
didn't know you could be.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.087 align:middle line:90%
And that's very powerful.

00:22:25.087 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
have observed in the work

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that I've done over
the years is to see

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
a person go through, what I
call, a dimensional shift.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And they are holding themselves
in one thought, in one idea,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and they believe they're limited
because of this situation

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:90%
or circumstance.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they're told,
either by me personally

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
or in the records, this
is just a construct

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:90%
you've constructed for yourself.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.135 align:middle line:84%
You can shift into
this other expression.

00:22:55.135 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
wrestle with it.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't agree.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And then they finally do.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And many of you have
seen this, where

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.957 align:middle line:90%
the room shifts and changes.

00:23:03.957 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's almost like you're
watching an earthquake, even

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:10%
though there's no
evidence of an earthquake,

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.058 align:middle line:10%
except for what
you're observing.

00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:10%
So if you've seen
that happen, you're

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:10%
actually seeing a
dimensional shift.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is allows the
person to literally jump tracks

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
from the timeline that they
were on to the timeline that's

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
closer to their
most evolved self.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I believe every one of
us has at least five ways

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to go on every
decision to above grade

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to below grade and one ideal.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So most everyone in
the room is already

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:90%
on that higher level of track.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But what is it
that will help you

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
become your most evolved self?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say ask for a
day of heaven on Earth

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and decide to wake up in 5D.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, thank you.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And Alexa Pearson is
a direct experiencer

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and has a lot of remembering of
her off-planet family, her star

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
family, and her
experiences there.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And she gets direct
transmissions, communications,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and information that she's
meant to come here and share

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate our
ascension process.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
So Alexa, can you share?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love to.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Hello, everyone.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to
be here with you.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:10%
And I as I gaze out into the
audience and I look at you,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:10%
I do not see the avatar
that you meticulously chose

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:10%
prior to your incarnation.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:10%
Because I know for
a fact that you did.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
What I see is the divine
fire, the beautiful fractal

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of source, creator, energy
that lies within you.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is ascension
that already

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
exists within you
that you will slide

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
into when you do the work.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I did come into this planet
with full cosmic consciousness.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I remember my family.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember all the beings I
am, and I exist simultaneously

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
in that space in
other realities.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember my
missions, my travels.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I have relationships,
the feelings

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with all of that.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me, well
when did all that start?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a choice.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And they trained me in science.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I come from.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
That part of the puzzle,
for me, is scientific.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I've had these experiences
with off-planet beings,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:10%
but that's not my
frame of reference.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
exciting part to me.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the science of ascension
and how you get there.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:84%
You can have a long arc
and that's your choice,

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:84%
or you can have a direct
slingshot into that space.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:90%
There is no judgment on either.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And the science starts
with you, with your cells.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
You are part of
a system, you are

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
part of a human system that
is beholden to the Earth, that

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
is also a second system, that's
beholden to the planets, which

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
is to the sun, which
is to the galaxy,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so
forth to the godhead.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And that godhead is
living within you.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
That is what I see flaming and
burning when I look out at you.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
micro to the macro.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's reverse it.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to you.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:90%
All of those systems are equal.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's scaled up,
but it's all equal.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:90%
You're all the same.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You're the same as that planet.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You're the same as the
central source sun.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And you are the
godhead of yourselves.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever tried
talking to yourselves?

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Honoring them?

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:90%
That's where ascension starts.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness moves through
your brain into your body.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And DNA will broadcast it out.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:90%
That is the avatar.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:84%
That creates the avatar that
you chose, again, back to cells,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.415 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to hit the veil.

00:26:51.415 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
cells is going

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to hit the veil of amnesia.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to
step into that space

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
where you dissolve
that memory loss.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And you can activate that.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's many, many
different ways to activate that.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
All five of us have different
opinions on how to do it.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So don't believe me or not-- you
don't have to believe anything

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I say about the aliens, but
let's look at the science

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:90%
because it's totally up to you.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to step into
that hologram of divine light.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:90%
And your story is required.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I just hope to inspire
you with my own story

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
kick the door down

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.925 align:middle line:84%
into your own
magnificent reality.

00:27:35.925 --> 00:27:36.725 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:36.725 --> 00:27:38.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:38.284 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And Nassim Haramein, he is
a brilliant cutting-edge

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
physicist that spent
over 30 years exploring

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:90%
that lens of the universe.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:10%
But, really, he's
exploring spirituality

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:10%
and documenting how all
of universe is connected,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:10%
and we are one.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's also on his
own spiritual journey.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So he's not just a mind
figuring it all out.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
He is a being in the spiritual
process in the truly--

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:90%
the sense of the word.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So Nassim, what is your amazing
viewpoint on what's going on?

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's great to be here.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad to hold this bookend,
maybe to give a little bit more

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of the male
perspective on things.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Being a scientific mind
and doing hard science,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:90%
when you do hard science--

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and I certainly have done
so throughout the years,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
there is something
remarkable that happens.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is that if
you're completely

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
honest about the
process that you're

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
ongoing as you're doing
research, there's a point where

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
if you're truly a
seeker of truth,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
where the scientific approach
kind of balance over--

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:84%
like, cross over
to a gut feeling,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.945 align:middle line:84%
a scientific intuition, a place
where all possibilities emerge,

00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
you are writing quantum
physics equation

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're realizing that an
electron could be anywhere

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:90%
in the universe at any time.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these
things are starting to--

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and if you allow it to
open, if you allow it to--

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
if you let go of the need to
quantify, just in that moment--

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
like you might quantify
later, which is critical,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.850 align:middle line:84%
because I think a lot of
what the ladies on the panel

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:84%
are talking about is
actually physics that

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:90%
is not quite well understood.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.940 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of the need
to quantify it in that moment,

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
you get to open up
to a whole new world,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to a whole world
of possibilities

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that eventually start
to have a relationship

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:32.375 align:middle line:10%
So, for me,
personally, it was in--

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:10%
I was in my van, very isolated
doing a lot of research

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:10%
for five years, climbing
every day, being in nature

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and being very within myself
in continuous contemplation,

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:10%
and meditation, and intention
of uncovering the mystery

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:10%
of the material world.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:10%
And in those moments,
moments of elimination,

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:10%
moments of great
revelation, which,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.840 align:middle line:10%
to me, relates to what you guys
are describing as ascension.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was
physical manifestation

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of these moments, that is
moments of glowing blue,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things
were happening to my body,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.330 align:middle line:90%
to my environment around me.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And so it was very profound.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:10%
And as I rode the physics and as
I understood deeper and deeper

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:10%
the mysteries of gravity, and
mass, and electromagnetism,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:10%
and magnetism, and so on,
I realized that ascension,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:10%
which was a parallel research I
was doing, was a state of mind,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:10.280 align:middle line:10%
in which there was an
opportunity to connect with

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:10%
a source of information within
me that was not localized,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:10%
that was not
non-linear, that was--

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:10%
non-local information
was available to me.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:10%
And as I realized that,
I realized that there

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:10%
was an analog in the physics--

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:35.486 align:middle line:10%
that is that entanglement,
the structure of spacetime,

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:10%
that the universe is
like a information

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:10%
highway, an information
network, non-local network,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:10%
and that there is application
to that information network

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with
controlling gravity.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I realized
that what ancient civilization

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:10%
talked about--

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:10%
and I was studying ancient
civilization and anthropology

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:10%
as well--

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:10%
about this moment
in history where

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:10%
humanity was going to ascend
was not just in the concept--

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:10%
and the interpretation
that's typically given,

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:10%
that it was going to ascend
in its consciousness,

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:10%
or in its awareness, but
it was coupled with--

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.670 align:middle line:10%
that the technology
to control gravity

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:10%
was going to become available
because of this higher

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:10%
understanding, this
higher awareness bringing

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:10%
new understanding of
the physical world,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:10%
that was going to give us the
capacity to literally get off

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:10%
the surface, which is
critical for evolution,

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:10%
literal ascension.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that's what it means.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Nassim, it's
so helpful to have all

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.020 align:middle line:84%
the perspectives on this,
because we are all of that.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd love to
do is widen the lens

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and look at a cosmic
perspective of this.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So these are some topics I'd
like to choose from, that you

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:90%
feel that you can speak to.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:84%
What is the current
cosmic ascension plan?

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
And these might be
some of the topics,

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
such as genetic transfiguration,
the scientific technology

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
of transfiguration,
shifting timelines,

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:84%
including the dismantling
of the corrupt system.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Also, talk about 5D
earth a little bit more.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What does that
really mean to evolve

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension?

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And do we do that as a
whole planetary system?

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, getting the assistance
of the higher galactic,

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:84%
says some of them mentioned,
or the ascended masters,

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:84%
how are they a part of
this ascension process.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the last things
you may want to talk about,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.070 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot of
what's been buzzing

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:84%
in our community, the solar
flash, those transmissions

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:84%
from the frequencies that
come in and really elevate

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the ascension process, is
this one of major solar flash

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:90%
that happens?

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it happening consistently?

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Or what is all that?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at the wider lens.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.985 align:middle line:84%
And Tracy, do you want to share
with me what you'd like to?

00:35:21.985 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, questions.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
What I love to do--
because we are approaching

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the subject of
ascension, I believe

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
we're entering a time where
perhaps everything can

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:84%
be answered because, of course,
we are quantum answering

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
questions at this time.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of what's happening,
the channelings that I receive

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
have taken me into some very
specific work on the seven

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
gateways to the central sun,
seven gateways, the seven

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:90%
major earth chakras.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is taking me into
showing up and definitively

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:84%
working at the sites for both
massive inner transformational

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
work that allows you
to indeed elevate

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:84%
your transformation
to the zero points,

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and then taking us into very
strong and very accelerated

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:90%
experiences of contact.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Now when I opened stargate,
in 2011 I was called to Egypt.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that took me to consciously
opening the first stargate.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the
interdimensional communication

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:90%
was extraordinary.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's something else
about what's happening,

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
which I suppose hasn't
necessarily been discussed,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.280 align:middle line:84%
is that when we're truly
in ascension, I mean,

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the reality gateways
are blown open live.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And that means your own live
feed is changing the reality

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:90%
that you're existing in.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I work in
the stargates--

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not just
referencing a interdimensional,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:84%
transdimensional
channelings communications.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing, I'm engaging
with the ancestors.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm engaging in all
levels of communications.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And then what is also
happening-- because I do

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:90%
do film work research.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have a body of films
that are also legitimately

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating what's
happening live when

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:90%
we're opening these star gates.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Now this is really important.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The first star gate, there
is a 15, 16-minute film

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of orbs breaking out of the
back wall of a temple at Habu.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And it is a temple of ascension.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the royal palace of Egypt.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I spend a lot of time in Egypt.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I see Egypt as
a massive influencer

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of ancient
intelligence,

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:84%
missing ancient
intelligence in terms

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of what's happened to
us within the context

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:90%
of our own consciousness.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
During that first
stargate experience,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:46.700 align:middle line:84%
where the interdimensions
were in a narrative,

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.920 align:middle line:84%
in, let me say, a
cosmic dance with me.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The response was to
my own consciousness,

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:90%
to my dedicated work.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So the awakening and activation
of your own consciousness

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is so important because
your consciousness,

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
you are the technology so
that you can become an avatar

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:90%
influencer within the 3D.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is what is
revolutionary about changing

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.130 align:middle line:90%
our planet.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:10%
It's hugely important
that we experience

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:10%
changes in our sacred
destiny, in our reality.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing energy.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing frequencies.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.080 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing the beings.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing what is
happening as well.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then this takes us out of
the mainstream spirituality,

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't really take us
into the technologies that

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
give us the full punch
into the ascension process.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.112 align:middle line:90%
So it's big stuff.

00:40:03.112 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Tracey.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And Meg, can you speak
to some of those topics?

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So I found that there's a
couple steps that we go through

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.800 align:middle line:84%
as we begin to open up
and become divine humans.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is learning
how to metabolize light

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.715 align:middle line:90%
into the biology.

00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And this, of
course, is something

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:90%
that we do in meditation.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:90%
You can do it anytime.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I've done it where I'm
sitting in traffic.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:84%
You can just start
opening your channel,

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
opening your chakra
pillar, and begin

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to bring in crystalline light.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to
start to transform

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:84%
our cellular structure from
carbon-based to crystalline.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So light needs to become part
of your daily routine, kind

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:90%
of like a another meal.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.345 align:middle line:84%
You're going to begin to feed
light into your whole system.

00:40:50.345 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, will also
help you raise your frequency.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So you start to unlock any
of the dense amnesia that's

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:90%
holding you down.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, too, I
found is we need to activate

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.350 align:middle line:90%
more of the right brain.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.210 align:middle line:84%
This is our multi-dimensional,
intuitive psychic brain

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.860 align:middle line:90%
that we used to visualize.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to start
visualizing our reality

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting it just
become a random thing that's

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:90%
taking us on a ride.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
We become, then, the
cocreators of our reality.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We begin to use the
visioning to communicate

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to the universe what
we want to create.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:32.445 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, too, I found
is we need to get out of time.

00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So what I call the shadow-ego
personality is a time

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:84%
construct, when we're not in
the past or not in the future,

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.290 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to hold our
presence in the zero point,

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
in the now.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Then, the ego dissolves.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's learning how to bring
basically your entire reality

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to zero point.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.680 align:middle line:90%
So I do this all the time.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I do it daily.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it's anything
that I'm involved in,

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
any project, any
traveling, any kind

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.580 align:middle line:84%
of collaboration with others,
even working with clients.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to go into
that zero-point field

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access the
quantum possibilities

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and begin to literally
recode and rebuild

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness,
and our genetic code,

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:90%
and our physical reality.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So these steps start to become
just part of your routine, part

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:90%
of your daily life.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a new way of living.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.990 align:middle line:84%
We're changing our
lifestyle in a way.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how to raise
our frequency, live on light,

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
use this multidimensional brain
of ours, this right brain.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.900 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty much a
left brain society.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.657 align:middle line:10%
We haven't developed much
of that right brain yet.

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.490 align:middle line:10%
When we were children,
we used it much more,

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:10%
because we were using
our imagination.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.548 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need to
open that up again.

00:42:46.548 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
visualize our reality.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
holographic universe.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start using
our holographic brain

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to communicate what
we want to create.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And then learning how to
get out of this push-pull

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.430 align:middle line:84%
of the polarized field,
which is, in a sense,

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
separating us from the quantum
field, when we can learn

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize and
come into zero point,

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.070 align:middle line:90%
then everything opens up to us.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, we can bring the
soul or presence into the body.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We can embody the soul essence
in our heart magnetism,

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and then start to draw in what
matches our soul frequency,

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.132 align:middle line:90%
our soul essence.

00:43:23.132 --> 00:43:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
call "synchronicity."

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's truly embodying
our true divine self,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and then that
starts to magnetize

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in what matches us, supports
us, and provides for us.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So as you go
through these steps,

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:84%
then everything
starts to change.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I also found that we need
to consciously choose

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to ground an anchor into
our ascension timeline.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are born into
family, ancestral lineage,

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and matrices, and
that was our timeline.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:84%
We can unlock, as Maureen
mentioned-- jump tracks,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
get into and lock on everyday
to our ascension timeline.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And this will change
everything for us.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.022 align:middle line:90%
And Lori.

00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I would love to address
a little bit about what's going

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:10%
on since that's one of the
things you brought up about

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:10%
the evolving earth.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's understand that
there are infinite potentials

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.140 align:middle line:90%
available for us.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:10%
And at every now
moment, we're making

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:10%
choices, either consciously
or unconsciously,

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:10%
about how we'll experience
our external reality

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:10%
or our relationship with
the external reality.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's always going to be
a mirror reflection of what's

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.890 align:middle line:90%
going on with us internally.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the third
dimensional reality,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.490 align:middle line:84%
where we've been
existing in separation,

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.320 align:middle line:84%
we were experiencing
that reality

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
from a place of victimhood
and unconsciousness.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
external reality

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.950 align:middle line:84%
was never a reflection
of who we were,

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.380 align:middle line:84%
but rather something
we were powerless over

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and had no control to
manipulate, or change, or do

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.080 align:middle line:90%
We were victimized in a sense.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It was impressed upon us and
had nothing to do with us.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is external forces
having control over us, right?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:10%
In this new reality,
we become fully,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.870 align:middle line:10%
and wholly, and
completely aware that

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:10%
the entire external reality is
a reflection of what is going on

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.500 align:middle line:10%
with us internally
and that, as we change

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.950 align:middle line:10%
with conscious choice, what's
going on with us internally,

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:10%
the external reality entirely
conforms changes and shifts.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.787 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
we are upleveling--

00:45:24.787 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're making new
conscious choices that are more

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
desirable, more
benefic'-- in other words,

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%
beneficial and benevolent.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we change and conform
with us internally-- thoughts,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:90%
emotions, mental--

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.790 align:middle line:84%
this impresses on the physical,
and radiates out from us,

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and then is
reflected back to us.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:84%
We up-level into a new timeline
of experience, essentially.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Then our whole
experience changes.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So when Meg says, get yourself
on your ascension timeline,

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
this is essentially
what she's saying.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Through the inner
transformation,

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.390 align:middle line:84%
we up-level, we integrate
a new experience,

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and then the external
reality reflects that back.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.657 align:middle line:84%
I hope this makes
sense to everybody.

00:46:04.657 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what we
need to understand

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:84%
about the new 5th
dimensional reality.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:10%
This new reality, which is
vibratory states, frequencies

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.390 align:middle line:10%
of energy that
vibrate in harmony--

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:10%
with peace, love, joy,
happiness, understanding,

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.530 align:middle line:10%
compassion, et cetera,
we must vibrate with that

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.260 align:middle line:10%
wholly and completely in
order to really anchor

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.000 align:middle line:10%
into that new reality.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:10%
So this ascension process
is where we're basically

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.580 align:middle line:10%
allowing ourselves to do so
through conscious, regular,

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.230 align:middle line:10%
ongoing choice--

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:10%
energy, clearings,
et cetera, that we've

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:10%
been discussing here.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.180 align:middle line:10%
But here's the key.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:10%
In order for this to
sustain for all of humanity,

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.760 align:middle line:10%
nothing inorganic
will sustain here.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
I mean by that--

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:84%
nothing that is non-beneficial
to the whole can sustain.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is
non beneficial realities

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and timelines inorganic to the
future of humanity drop out

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of the experience.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Perfect example, World War III.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Never going to happen.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.430 align:middle line:84%
No matter how you're
brainwashed or they

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:07.710 align:middle line:84%
try to brainwash-- just
not going to happen.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Because the frequencies
that we're now

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:10%
existing on in this collective
group are too peace-joy-love

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:10%
based.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They cannot sustain something
that is non beneficial

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and non-benevolent.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.480 align:middle line:10%
This is so important
for us to understand

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.340 align:middle line:10%
because it helps us to reclaim
our power to create what we

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.950 align:middle line:10%
truly desire as a collective.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.430 align:middle line:10%
Because the
foundational foundation

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.430 align:middle line:10%
is that which serves the highest
and best of all concerned

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.800 align:middle line:10%
with harm to none, bar none.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the thing.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:10%
If you're a gatekeeper
or a grid worker,

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:10%
if you understand these terms,
those of us who are literally

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:10%
gatekeeping for the
higher realities

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.700 align:middle line:10%
to manifest and materialize
for all on planet Earth,

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.200 align:middle line:10%
we know, as gatekeepers, we get
to say, not in this reality.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.385 align:middle line:10%
No thank you.

00:47:56.385 --> 00:47:59.400 align:middle line:10%
And we can drop stuff
out that's too dense.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.200 align:middle line:84%
If we're grid
workers, we're working

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:90%
with the grid of the Earth.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.580 align:middle line:10%
We're using crystalline
Christ consciousness

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.160 align:middle line:10%
and anchoring that
into the physical earth

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.760 align:middle line:10%
so that all beings
can elevate from that.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a foundational work.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So I hope this makes
sense to people.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But the key to get is this--
this is where I'm leading it to

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll complete.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:10%
Think of reverse engineering.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:10%
The completion-- there's
never a completion.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But the evolution of
humanity is assured.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.710 align:middle line:10%
It's already created
at a timeline, where

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:10%
we are all leveling up to--

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.720 align:middle line:10%
that timeline where
the future of humanity

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:10%
is assured as peaceful,
benevolent, and loving,

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:10%
where all beings get to
create in a conscious way

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:10%
to choose new
desirable experiences

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.270 align:middle line:10%
with this foundation for
the highest and best of all

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.000 align:middle line:10%
with harm to none is assured.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to
keep our eye on that,

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand that that's
where we're all going.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.127 align:middle line:84%
That is the reverse
engineering-- from there.

00:49:00.127 --> 00:49:00.960 align:middle line:10%
That's the back out.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.920 align:middle line:84%
We're just somewhere on a
timeline leading to that.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.465 align:middle line:90%
And I hope that makes sense.

00:49:05.465 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, thank you, Lori.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I love what
you guys are saying,

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:10%
and it's so nice to be
around kindred souls.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Specifically addressing the
question that you asked,

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I am a direct
channel from source.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And a number of years ago, maybe
about seven or eight years ago,

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that there was fear
in how this transformation was

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.670 align:middle line:90%
going to occur.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And the ETs of light
that I was working with

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.040 align:middle line:10%
were showing me,
energetically, that there

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:47.690 align:middle line:10%
was a lot of concern about
your feelings of fear,

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:10%
of fright, of the challenges to
changing your belief systems,

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:10%
and that that would cause you--

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:59.010 align:middle line:10%
and I say "you," but I mean
the collective "you," the body

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.510 align:middle line:10%
of humans on the planet--

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:04.620 align:middle line:10%
would cause so much
dysfunctional emotion

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.780 align:middle line:10%
that there was a problem,
if you will, to transform.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole idea was
to do so with grace and ease.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.440 align:middle line:10%
More recently, the energy that
they are transmitting to me

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:10%
is that that has been
resolved and that humanity

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.730 align:middle line:10%
has moved to a place where
they can maintain their peace

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and harmony.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:10%
They may encounter shock,
and fear, and surprise,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.110 align:middle line:10%
but it won't cause them to
move into emotional dysfunction

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.320 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.340 align:middle line:10%
So just like Lori
was saying about

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.730 align:middle line:10%
the transformation
is already foretold.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.000 align:middle line:10%
In one of my earlier books,
I was channeling the message

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.920 align:middle line:10%
from the ascended
masters, that we were

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:10%
in a free-fall free-for-all.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And they showed
me people jumping

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.350 align:middle line:10%
from a plane with parachutes.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going to get on the
ground safely with a parachute.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they do before they
pull the chute is up to them.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So they can do somersaults.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.450 align:middle line:84%
They can hook up
with other people.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.100 align:middle line:84%
They can change the
way they're going.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They can change
where they're going.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.910 align:middle line:10%
And that freefall is
this opportunity for us

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.180 align:middle line:10%
to stand in our
power and to have fun

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.150 align:middle line:10%
becoming our most evolved self.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I will tell you that there
is something very specific that

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen on March 21.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:10%
And you might notice it,
but a lot of people won't.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Because one of the things
that I have noticed

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.590 align:middle line:10%
is that when you are--

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:10%
I'll say a member of this club
and you have family members who

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.660 align:middle line:10%
aren't, they can make fun of
you because of your interest

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.305 align:middle line:10%
in esoteric things and teach
you at family gatherings.

00:51:43.305 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, they call
you and they start asking you

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.420 align:middle line:90%
about some of this stuff.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And you answer them politely.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.330 align:middle line:10%
And you get off the phone
and you think, wait a minute.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't used
to think this way.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
they woke up in 5D.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that a lot
of the people that we're

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:84%
seeing as resistors
are simply extras,

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:90%
waiting for us to step up.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we step up to a
place of unconditional love

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and unconditional
beingness, then we're

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.840 align:middle line:84%
all going to have that
opportunity to go higher.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So I believe on March 21
that something significant

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen and
that that consciousness

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is going to be hit with
a wave of love that

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.960 align:middle line:84%
is so great that
everyone you know

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.310 align:middle line:84%
will be different
than they used to be.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And some of you will remember.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Some of you won't.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And you'll just keep on
going because you weren't

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.940 align:middle line:84%
aware of the outer
world's consciousness,

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK, too.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that I
believe helps us dissolve ego

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and allows us to be connected
to the earth into each other

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to connect
with your higher self.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And your higher self is
your fifth-dimensional self.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.110 align:middle line:90%
It is the ascended master you.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect
with that advisor

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to
communicate with that energy

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and stay in that place
of always asking,

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.050 align:middle line:90%
humility is forthcoming.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
worry about your ego,

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.050 align:middle line:84%
because you're always checking
in with your resource.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.195 align:middle line:84%
And your resource
is the divine you.

00:53:20.195 --> 00:53:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Maureen.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.060 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.311 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Alexa?

00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe that
ascension is as individual

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:84%
as it is collective and as
physical as it is spiritual.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded and
inundated with beings

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
in different dimensions,
of different planets.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I know that, in
my own experience,

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that resonates as
incredibly true.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I write multiple books about
it called the zero point.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We keep talking
about the zero point.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And these beings, some of
them came as a shock to me.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I am not a religious
person whatsoever.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.830 align:middle line:90%
My religion is love.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I come from a cosmic
perspective, not

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.970 align:middle line:90%
an earthly one.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
when Yeshua showed up

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:84%
in my living room, that
would be Jesus, I went,

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:90%
no, you have the wrong house.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.177 align:middle line:90%
You might want to try next door.

00:54:18.177 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's stubborn.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.810 align:middle line:90%
He stayed.

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, I said, all
right, what do you got?

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So he taught me about
the Christ consciousness.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a religious thing.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a
scientific thing.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It is a grid.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And it starts from
the core of the Earth,

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and it goes all the
way up in space,

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and it holds up all life.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, enter
another being--

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.600 align:middle line:90%
the Magdalenes.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It was Mary Magdalene,
she shows up.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
here we go again,

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.250 align:middle line:90%
another religious figure.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So she trains me in
the Magdalene Order,

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
which is a divine
order of men and women

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that have a sacred
mission of a frequency.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're going to
science, not religion.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And they trained me on this
physical plasmic energy.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a field.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And that field is superimposed
on this Christ consciousness.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me
how to use that.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And then together,
they blended those

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.240 align:middle line:84%
into the divine matrix,
which is something new

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.500 align:middle line:90%
that I unveiled here.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sacred geometry.

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And each of this within you.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a diamond that
rotates at the heart

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:84%
chakra in the third
eye, and it is also

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:35.180 align:middle line:84%
embedded in every sentiment
consciousness in this universe.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And it rotates.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.310 align:middle line:90%
And you can connect with it.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's an ascension tool.

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a vortex that has
gravity and weight.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a portal.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's my great
honor, it took me

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:48.380 align:middle line:84%
decades to be able to have the
language, the earthly language

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:90%
to download it.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
quantum field, when

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.990 align:middle line:84%
you're in space
time, not time space,

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.590 align:middle line:90%
the language is very different.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to
communicate it to other people,

00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's very, very difficult.
So that did come to light.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So you are so supported by so
many beings, but it's up to you

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to step out of
resistance, and that's

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:84%
that earthly thing that requires
having ego-dissolving moments.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of fun.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.098 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to spend
your weekend doing that

00:56:17.098 --> 00:56:20.930 align:middle line:84%
particularly, but
it's necessary.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:22.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're having the
earthly experience,

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.730 align:middle line:84%
your role is to
transmute all that

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and become the observer
of your experience

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.480 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get into
these other experiences,

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and try them on, and
see where you go.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, we're
back to your story.

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We're back to your
divine fire and how

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.830 align:middle line:84%
that connects to the universe
and to the multiverses.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.890 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:52.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, Nassim.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.045 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:56.045 --> 00:57:00.737 align:middle line:90%


00:57:00.737 --> 00:57:03.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure which
subject to pick.

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It's complex.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Out of that question,
I would say,

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.690 align:middle line:84%
well, you know,
when I think of 5D,

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.735 align:middle line:90%
I think of a [INAUDIBLE] metric.

00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I might be a
little lost, but I'm

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:24.630 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you
guys are describing

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:28.560 align:middle line:84%
a different scale of
information transfer

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that the environment of our
solar system is entering in.

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when I think
of that, I think

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:41.400 align:middle line:84%
of some of that calculation I
did early on, like in the '90s.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:45.270 align:middle line:10%
And some of the evidence that
supported these calculations

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:48.960 align:middle line:10%
throughout the years,
because our solar system--

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.280 align:middle line:10%
and part of your question
is about solar flashes--

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.400 align:middle line:10%
our solar system is
entering into a denser

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.060 align:middle line:10%
region and a higher
electromagnetic region

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.220 align:middle line:10%
of our galaxy.

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.295 align:middle line:90%
We know that now.

00:58:02.295 --> 00:58:04.860 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I predicted it somewhat
loosely in the '90s

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.420 align:middle line:84%
by doing calculation
in the relationship

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.060 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system to
the galactic structure.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I did
these calculations,

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there would be
a compression or an increase

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:33.210 align:middle line:84%
in radiation of our heliosphere,
that is the solar wind

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:38.700 align:middle line:84%
sphere that holds the
solar system as it's

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.450 align:middle line:84%
moving through space
and to the galaxy.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And the compression
of that bubble,

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:52.290 align:middle line:84%
if you'd like to think of it,
would increase the radiation

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:56.310 align:middle line:84%
inside our solar system, and
that we should see changes

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:58.920 align:middle line:84%
on planetary systems
in our solar system,

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.880 align:middle line:84%
like heating up of the planets,
changing in our solar dynamics,

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.680 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And throughout
the years, then, I

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:13.770 align:middle line:84%
have done a lot of solar
monitoring and data

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:18.300 align:middle line:84%
acquisition of solar dynamics
and so on-- and analysis.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I found this
evidence along the years,

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and then I was very excited
when the Voyager probes got out

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:28.510 align:middle line:90%
of the heliosphere.

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time, humanity was

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:36.660 align:middle line:84%
able to look around
directly from probes outside

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of the heliosphere,
and they literally

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.950 align:middle line:84%
saw this higher
density region that's

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.900 align:middle line:84%
pushing on the
heliosphere, that's

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.240 align:middle line:84%
compressing the front of the
heliosphere and the radiation.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was big press
conference at NASA.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.430 align:middle line:84%
At first, they were
very worried about it.

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, they realized,
actually, it's going to be OK.

00:59:57.390 --> 01:00:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But, basically, we're
baiting in a whole new level

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.510 align:middle line:90%
of information.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's more
information available.

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:11.190 align:middle line:90%
There's more energy available.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.175 align:middle line:84%
There's more
radiation available.

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And it requires an adjustment.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's driving an
evolutionary step for humanity

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary
transformation for humanity--

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and that, I think,
people are feeling it

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not just the
amazing people on this panel

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.510 align:middle line:90%
that I'm honored to be with.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's, as well, scientists,
and business people,

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and political figures and so on.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling this new
level of information,

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
this flaring of
our solar system,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.575 align:middle line:90%
this flaring of our sun.

01:00:57.575 --> 01:01:00.120 align:middle line:90%


01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the result is that it can
be a little bit uncomfortable.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It can create a little bit havoc
with your bodily functions,

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
with your clarity.

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've noticed
throughout the years--

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
because I monitor the sun a
lot, when there's solar flare

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
activity, like if
you're on the highway,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
you notice people start
driving weird, you know?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.882 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what is
wrong with these people?

01:01:33.882 --> 01:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, you look
up, the solar activity

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
is like, oh, yeah,
just-- you know?

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.745 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.745 --> 01:01:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And we can see this
physiologically,

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning we can measure brain
wave frequency changes when

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
solar activity is occurring
and sun flaring and all this.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.120 align:middle line:90%
So it has a real impact.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Like, it is a reality.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
We are changing
in energy levels.

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And, globally, the
morphogenetic field is evolving.

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:08.130 align:middle line:90%
So as a result--

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:10.890 align:middle line:84%
as well as the result
of the stressors

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that it produces on our
society and requiring

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have new levels of
technology and new levels

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
of understanding of
the universe to be

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.940 align:middle line:90%
able to move to the next level.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's my interpretation.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:29.310 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this wonderful that we
have the five women painting

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
this expansive picture
of what's possible,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and then the masculine
grounds it in specifics.

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:42.090 align:middle line:10%
It makes it really real to all
parts of how we think and look.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:43.375 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate that.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:02:44.175 --> 01:02:44.975 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

01:02:44.975 --> 01:02:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'd like to get really
real and personal, because this

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
is really why we're here.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.640 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with us?

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
What is this process
of transformation?

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
What's really going on
on a personal level?

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So some of the other things
that we could talk about

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.560 align:middle line:90%
is DNA activation.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of the light body,
the activation of the merkaba,

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
soul's ascension timeline,
which we started talking about,

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and the total transfiguration
and building heart magnetism,

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.850 align:middle line:90%
how important that is.

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, the process of
healing your core wounds,

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
how that's so important
to not being brought down

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to the dense negative
energies, but really going

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
through core healing
that can have you

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
really exist at a higher level.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And what is this thing
called ascension flu

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that people go through when
they go through an upleveling

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and they actually have
flu like symptoms?

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Or going through the
dark night of the soul,

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.610 align:middle line:90%
that your soul calls in--

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
everything that
you love goes away,

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and you have to reconstruct your
whole life from a whole nother

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.230 align:middle line:90%
level connected with source.

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Or sharing about what the
phenomenon is of the new human

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, the higher levels

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of intuition, the higher
levels of functioning,

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
being able to manifest
whatever you want,

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
as we're all now
practicing how to manifest.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that's the
process of 5D reality

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.355 align:middle line:84%
is be able to
instantly manifest.

01:04:20.355 --> 01:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Also, just existing
in the quantum field,

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're
talking about.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:32.130 align:middle line:90%
So many topics there.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Take it away.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Tracy, what would you
like to share with us

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
about this personal experience?

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to speak about
going back to your sacred

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
experiences, your
sacred destiny.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Every challenge that
we meet on the planet

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and within our own lives, the
landscape of our understanding

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
can be changed when we immerse
ourselves in the sacred.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So we look to asking
the right questions,

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
coming back to what is
my sacred destiny, what

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
are the dreams of my own
evolution, my own ascension,

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
my own transformation, what
was I designed for as a human

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.070 align:middle line:90%
being?

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Sacred designed for?

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And each and every
one of you will all

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.840 align:middle line:90%
agree that we all have dreams.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Those individuals who
are intelligent enough

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss the false matrix and
to dismiss what we are often

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
influenced by, then
those individuals

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
break down the walls
of limitations.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The generic walls--
the walls that

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
tie us into stereotypes,
the walls that

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:23.350 align:middle line:84%
tie us into never transforming
and overhauling the wound.

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is hugely important.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe the inner work that
we must do at this time is huge.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our responsibility
and dedication

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
must be that we must
look to ourselves

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and take great and
deep responsibility.

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I also believe there's an
entirely different frontier

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
of work technologies that are
now being designed and gifted

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to us, which means this arena
is emerging and revolution also.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is hugely important
because the technologies

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we must stand in
a new frontier--

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and that means we must stand
in technologies that perhaps

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.690 align:middle line:90%
aren't so familiar to us.

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
interesting in this arena.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Because often we cling to
technologies that do not work.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very interested in how
we begin to experiment more

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.130 align:middle line:90%
with direct experiences now--

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to be trained to have
direct experiences,

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
frequency experiences to
stand in the gateways,

01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to stand in the gateways that
hold these magical keys of zero

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.570 align:middle line:90%
point.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the void.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.080 align:middle line:10%
Now I translate this
with David Bowie.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.020 align:middle line:10%
David Bowie left
"Blackstar," his legacy.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has all the
clues within the contact

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.689 align:middle line:90%
of our ascension.

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The black star is,
of course, the void.

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And the void is where all
the sacred magic resides.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.779 align:middle line:84%
And it's powerful
enough to support you.

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:35.899 align:middle line:10%
And it's the first
house of metaphysics,

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:40.970 align:middle line:10%
which also needs to be
initiated and reawakened

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:47.210 align:middle line:10%
as ordinary gifts on
a day-to-day basis.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:51.649 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the avatars that
are being sacred called

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
at this time, to be
activated is one thing,

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.930 align:middle line:90%
to sustain it is another.

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:06.670 align:middle line:10%
We are being trained,
and encouraged,

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:12.580 align:middle line:10%
and initiated into this phase--

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:17.229 align:middle line:10%
reality gateway of revolution.

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Now if you feel sacred called
to be brave and fearless enough

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.529 align:middle line:10%
to step into the
unknown, I mean,

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.979 align:middle line:10%
the technologies
of 4D practices,

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:32.510 align:middle line:10%
technologies will not work.

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:42.529 align:middle line:84%
So we must be brave and fearless
and step up into the unknown.

01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that courage will awaken and
activate incredible processes

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:58.276 align:middle line:84%
of sacred destiny, and love, and
contracts that also assist you.

01:09:58.276 --> 01:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.995 align:middle line:10%
Meg.

01:10:05.995 --> 01:10:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you're hearing, there's
different ways to go into this

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:11.510 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that we're all
from our own unique galactic

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
ancestral lineage, which is kind
of what we resonate with-- so

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
just kind of following what
talks to you, what grabs

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
your heart, which pulls
you, that will tell you,

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
then, this is embedded in
me, this is encoded in me,

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
this is my own lineage.

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
For myself, my lineage goes
into the metatron lineage.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I had direct contact
with Archangel Metatron

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
in the early years and
has been guiding me

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
through my steps and
techniques that work for me

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
and that I teach.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.370 align:middle line:10%
And it's working
with sacred geometry,

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.040 align:middle line:10%
especially, working with
Metatron's Cube, which

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.890 align:middle line:10%
is the template of
creation in our universe

01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:58.310 align:middle line:10%
and working with the infinity
loop, the infinity sign

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:59.660 align:middle line:10%
as well.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.670 align:middle line:10%
And these are very
simple templates

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:09.680 align:middle line:10%
that you can start to apply
in your meditation practice.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.860 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that is
embedded in Metatron's Cube

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.080 align:middle line:10%
is the double star merkaba.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is, of course,
when you are working

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:22.700 align:middle line:10%
within your own field,
it starts to open it up

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.190 align:middle line:10%
within your body and
your aura and begin

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to activate this double star
tetrahedron merkaba geometry,

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.070 align:middle line:10%
will then begin to
activate your torus.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And the torus is, of
course, your vehicle

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
for multi-dimensional
access, and it's also

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:41.500 align:middle line:90%
your vehicle to receive.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
When we've been governed and
controlled by the left brain,

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
everything had to be kind of
pushed against gravity, right?

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:51.560 align:middle line:10%
It was all effort and struggle.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And when we begin to shift
out of that paradigm,

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:58.850 align:middle line:10%
that matrix reality, we start
to get more heart based.

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:03.560 align:middle line:10%
So we're kind of dropping down
from agitated analytical mind

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.360 align:middle line:10%
and getting more into the heart.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.920 align:middle line:10%
The problem is most
of our hearts--

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.910 align:middle line:10%
I know mine was-- was very
contracted and guarded.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.890 align:middle line:10%
And I had very
shallow breathing,

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and I couldn't get much
energy into my heart.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.720 align:middle line:10%
So to do a lot of core-wounding
healing in the heart space,

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.730 align:middle line:10%
both of this life
and past life, to be

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:27.440 align:middle line:10%
able to open up this magnificent
heart chakra that we need.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.570 align:middle line:10%
Because that's also the
center of your merkaba.

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:34.340 align:middle line:10%
You need the heart to
be fully receiving.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking about literally
receiving from the higher

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.760 align:middle line:10%
dimensions into your
body, into your heart.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.970 align:middle line:10%
When the heart is
open, then you begin

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:47.900 align:middle line:10%
to activate your magnetism.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.400 align:middle line:10%
I know in the
earlier years, I kept

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.320 align:middle line:10%
asking Metatron, my higher
self, I can't seem to manifest.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.680 align:middle line:10%
What's the deal here?

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm struggling.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:56.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm starving.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.530 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:01.310 align:middle line:10%
And I kept hearing, you're
going to manifest and magnetize

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.510 align:middle line:10%
what's within your heart.

01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:middle line:10%
And your heart is shut down.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Your heart is empty.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:07.430 align:middle line:10%
So you're magnetizing
more emptiness.

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.660 align:middle line:10%
I was like, oh, damn.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.100 align:middle line:90%
I need to get in my heart.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was part of
the process of opening,

01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:16.283 align:middle line:84%
healing, getting my soul
presence in the heart,

01:13:16.283 --> 01:13:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and then everything changed.

01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Then, I could start to pull
in what actually resonates

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
with my soul and matches my soul
purpose and my soul destiny.

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So heart.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is the fifth
dimension is a feeling field.

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:31.375 align:middle line:90%
So we enter it from the heart.

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't enter
it from the mind.

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the heart
has to get opened

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and present with your
soul essence, your soul

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.480 align:middle line:90%
frequency, your soul vibration.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, then, that
elevates you in

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and opens the portal to
the fifth dimensional field

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and higher.

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So heart work, you
guys, is so important.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you can do, I
would just encourage everyone

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to do some work there.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just tuning
in to the heart and asking,

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:00.050 align:middle line:90%
what do you need from me?

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm here for you.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
How can I help
you heal and open?

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Then, you become a receiver
being, instead of this

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
pushing and efforting being.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.170 align:middle line:90%
You become a receptor.

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%
And then, the heavens come in.

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You're open to the
abundance that's

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.480 align:middle line:90%
available in our universe.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So heart energy, I really
encourage everyone,

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.775 align:middle line:84%
is really a priority
in this ascension.

01:14:21.775 --> 01:14:22.575 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:22.575 --> 01:14:24.286 align:middle line:10%
>> Great, thank you.

01:14:24.286 --> 01:14:27.250 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.402 align:middle line:90%
Lori?

01:14:28.402 --> 01:14:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So I want to address a little
bit about the sun since we--

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.840 align:middle line:10%
I didn't get that in before.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.310 align:middle line:10%
The solar flares are largely,
from a spiritual evolutionary

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:42.610 align:middle line:10%
perspective, from a perspective
of ascension, assisting

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:47.350 align:middle line:10%
us to activate and accelerate
our ability to be light body,

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:51.430 align:middle line:10%
to activate light within our
body, and to-- what is light?

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:53.320 align:middle line:10%
To enlighten us.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.720 align:middle line:10%
And if we understand
that this sun, which

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.630 align:middle line:10%
we could deem the Son of
God, that is conscious,

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:03.220 align:middle line:10%
just like Mother Earth Gaia
is, Son of God, Solaris,

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.010 align:middle line:10%
is providing us
with consciousness

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.700 align:middle line:10%
through this
evolutionary process.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So as we work with the
consciousness of Solaris

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and the sun, this
consciousness also

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.410 align:middle line:84%
assists us to ascend and
to elevate our frequency.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now to understand the DNA part,
I really want to address this.

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:24.100 align:middle line:10%
Because part of what I've been
doing now for about 12 years

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.860 align:middle line:10%
or so is helping
people and animals

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.470 align:middle line:10%
to activate the
dormant DNA, and also

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:33.590 align:middle line:10%
to clear out the corrupted
DNA from our lineage.

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:35.480 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
this for a moment.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.108 align:middle line:10%
We know, in our
physical reality,

01:15:37.108 --> 01:15:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and in what we've called this
third dimensional reality

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.990 align:middle line:10%
of physical experience, we
have two strands of DNA that

01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:47.320 align:middle line:10%
were basically-- that are
basically recordkeepers,

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.630 align:middle line:10%
storing up information from our
ancestors of their experiences.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And the corrupted
parts of that DNA

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is what science
or genetics would

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.230 align:middle line:90%
deem harmful or detrimental.

01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:02.710 align:middle line:10%
In other words, you have
a propensity for diabetes,

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:05.120 align:middle line:10%
you have a propensity
for depression.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.650 align:middle line:10%
You have a propensity
for breast cancer--

01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:10.840 align:middle line:10%
and then, you slice
your breasts off.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.300 align:middle line:10%
OK, but, really,
what it is is it's

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.080 align:middle line:10%
areas of our ancestors, where
they were out of alignment

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.250 align:middle line:10%
with the divine.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:21.850 align:middle line:10%
And they left these codes in
the first two strands of DNA

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:26.860 align:middle line:10%
so that we could go back, and
clear them, and claim the gifts

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.180 align:middle line:10%
of that that they were missing.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.260 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, in the
first two strands of DNA,

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.070 align:middle line:10%
if you have a program
or a coding in there

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:38.590 align:middle line:10%
from your ancestors
of diabetes, that's

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.410 align:middle line:10%
a storyline, where the
ancestors didn't know how

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:43.780 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy the sweetness of life.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.180 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know how
to process sweetness.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.220 align:middle line:10%
They were out of
alignment with the joy

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.590 align:middle line:10%
of allowing sweetness to flow.

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:53.200 align:middle line:10%
They felt powerless in
some way, shape, or form

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.820 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy sweetness, right?

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.760 align:middle line:10%
This is just coded in
the ancestral lineage.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.220 align:middle line:10%
And we can actually now, with
our consciousness, higher

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.250 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, identify it,
and clear it, and resolve it.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.130 align:middle line:10%
Claim the gifts--
completely, clear that out

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:07.960 align:middle line:10%
from the first two
strands of DNA.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.200 align:middle line:10%
Of course, science doesn't
know this, Western science,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.810 align:middle line:10%
but its being discovered
from these higher

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:15.260 align:middle line:10%
realms of consciousness.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.870 align:middle line:10%
Now beyond the first
two strands of DNA,

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:20.050 align:middle line:10%
we also know that we have,
in the physical world,

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:24.160 align:middle line:10%
at least 10 more strands of DNA
that also have codes in them.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.460 align:middle line:10%
Those codes tend to be
the desirable codes--

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:31.030 align:middle line:10%
the things we want to aspire
to, to awaken within us.

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:33.160 align:middle line:10%
They include
crystalline codes that

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.830 align:middle line:10%
are linked into the crystalline
consciousness, which links

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:37.870 align:middle line:10%
into Christ consciousness.

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:41.260 align:middle line:10%
They include codes of light
from Solaris, the Son of God,

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.870 align:middle line:10%
to enlighten us, to
allow us to transform

01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:46.990 align:middle line:10%
into these crystalline-form
bodies, light bodies.

01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:50.410 align:middle line:10%
They include codes for your
perfect and ideal states

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:53.410 align:middle line:10%
of health and well-being,
which are the original divine

01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:57.640 align:middle line:10%
blueprint for humanity, which
is the eradication of illness,

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.770 align:middle line:10%
disease, suffering.

01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Your original divine blueprint
in your DNA, by the way,

01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.950 align:middle line:10%
waiting to be activated
is as unique to you

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:08.430 align:middle line:10%
as your thumbprint is.

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:11.590 align:middle line:10%
And once you activate it
and reveal it to yourself,

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:13.900 align:middle line:10%
all of your solutions
for your life,

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.650 align:middle line:10%
for you to live your highest
and best life, to aspire to

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:20.260 align:middle line:10%
and to claim your
rightful dream,

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:24.970 align:middle line:10%
your most joyful,
fulfilling life experience

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:27.700 align:middle line:10%
and your greatest service
and contribution to humanity,

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.080 align:middle line:10%
as your own awakening being,
god embodiment, source embodied,

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.880 align:middle line:10%
is in there.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.010 align:middle line:10%
It's in your codes of
your DNA, waiting for you

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:37.720 align:middle line:10%
to access and reveal.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.060 align:middle line:10%
And so this is part of
the awakening process.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.780 align:middle line:10%
We clear out the corrupted DNA,
not just from our ancestors,

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:47.620 align:middle line:10%
but also including perhaps
implants that keep us--

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.290 align:middle line:10%
for example, there's an
implant, divide and conquer--

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:54.550 align:middle line:10%
keeps us separated, arguing,
debating, two different sides

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:56.510 align:middle line:10%
of polarity, extremes.

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm a Republican, you're
a Democrat; I'm white,

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.130 align:middle line:10%
you're black; blah, blah.

01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:01.660 align:middle line:10%
That's corrupted kind of stuff.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.220 align:middle line:10%
That gets cleared out.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And then, these dormant
potentials within us

01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:11.703 align:middle line:10%
are sitting there waiting
for us to activate and claim.

01:19:11.703 --> 01:19:13.620 align:middle line:10%
So this is part of our
ascension process, too,

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.121 align:middle line:10%
and this is part of--

01:19:15.121 --> 01:19:17.980 align:middle line:10%
in part with the
crystalline kingdom

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.830 align:middle line:10%
the crystals are helping
us with and the Solaris,

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:23.110 align:middle line:10%
the Son of God, and of
course Mother Earth Gaia,

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:26.680 align:middle line:10%
and all her consciousness, as
well as our most benevolent,

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.440 align:middle line:10%
loving beings in the
non-physical realm, who

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.760 align:middle line:10%
are here to assist us as well.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.040 align:middle line:10%
And that includes
angels, archangels,

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.387 align:middle line:10%
and other benevolent
star family races

01:19:35.387 --> 01:19:37.720 align:middle line:10%
who are here to assist and
help us through this journey.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I hope that's helpful.

01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much.

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:41.270 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:42.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:44.695 align:middle line:90%
OK, Maureen.

01:19:44.695 --> 01:19:47.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you made a big list--

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:52.120 align:middle line:10%
DNA, light activation, 5D
merkaba, heart magnetism.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want to speak
to the sacred geometry

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and also to the
merkaba, and tell you

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that there is an evolved
version of a merkaba that

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
will help you open up
all of these chakras

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and also allow you then to open
up the portal to your higher

01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
self and allow that information
to flow through you.

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting is,

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:21.190 align:middle line:84%
after you activate and learn
how to use your higher chakras,

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
then you'll become a being
that doesn't have any.

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's so funny.

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like you
evolve through this process,

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and then, at a certain point,
you just don't need them.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these
chakras are energy centers

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to
receive information

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
from the people around us,
from the world around us,

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and then to use that information
as a way to understand

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and experience the world.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:49.210 align:middle line:10%
So the energy of
the merkaba creates

01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:53.080 align:middle line:10%
a fifth-dimensional
field around your body,

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.140 align:middle line:10%
which allows you then
to be fifth dimensional.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And being fifth
dimensional means

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that you can keep your heart
open without fear of damage,

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
or being attacked, or rained on.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't mean people
won't do things like that.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But what will happen
is you'll be like Neo

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in "The Matrix," who
suddenly discovered

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
he can dodge bullets.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.348 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
he could do that.

01:21:16.348 --> 01:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
There'll be incoming insults,
and you'll notice them,

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see the love
behind them, like the time

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
my stepfather said, you're
just like your mother.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.608 align:middle line:84%
And I leaned back
and I said, wow,

01:21:27.608 --> 01:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the nicest
things you've ever said.

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And now his tone was
trying to hurt me,

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.580 align:middle line:90%
but I knew he loved my mother.

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I could claim
that, which is what I did.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the first
thing we're going to be doing

01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is activating our ability
to stay open-hearted.

01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to connect that

01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
with the mind that will
also expand in a huge way

01:21:56.050 --> 01:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and reframe the reality that
we currently experience,

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and in so doing, open
up our capacity, then,

01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
higher chakras, which

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to manifest
things in our hands

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and to allow us to
understand people,

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
even though they might not
speak our language and so on.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And all of these gifts are
a process of experience

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and experimentation.

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And we chose this as
a way to experience

01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and to expand the mind of God.

01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So our purpose here isn't
to fix what is broken,

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
as much as it is to reclaim
that which is already ours.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.800 align:middle line:10%
And in so doing, have
fun and have joy,

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and allow ourselves to
become this expansive beings

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.410 align:middle line:10%
that we already are.

01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Now I love the things that are
being said by Meg because she

01:22:57.190 --> 01:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and I, it's almost like we're
sitting in the same classroom

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.510 align:middle line:90%
in other realms.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Because even though I
know her and I love her,

01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:05.990 align:middle line:90%
we don't communicate.

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:07.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't share information.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet, everything that
comes out of her mouth, dang,

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.210 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say that.

01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.293 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I better not say that.

01:23:11.293 --> 01:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%
She said it.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm laughing at myself
because so much of what you get

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.762 align:middle line:84%
and you tell people
is exactly the same.

01:23:18.762 --> 01:23:20.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's a good sign
for you because it

01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:23.710 align:middle line:10%
means that you can allow
yourself to go there

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:25.520 align:middle line:10%
and to be comfortable in it.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So I believe the
activation of the merkaba

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
will help you open your heart,
creating that safe space that

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:37.510 align:middle line:84%
allows you then to safely
explore with your mind

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and merge the mind and the
body into a sacred dance.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're going.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Great, beautiful.

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:49.640 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.625 align:middle line:90%
And Alexa.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.980 align:middle line:10%
I love this questions so much.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I love it so much because
I wrote nine books

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
about my personal
experience with it.

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
All of my life, I have not been
trying to get out of my body.

01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to get
in my body and ground.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Because Earth is
kind of hard, man.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- you know,
it's not that fun when

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.610 align:middle line:90%
you're in polarity and duality.

01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you decided to
manifest, pre-incarnatively,

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you chose activation points
during your lifetime,

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:25.280 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
conscious of it or not.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I myself remember choosing
some, but then there's

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
others I do not
remember choosing.

01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Word of advice, when you get
an ego-dissolving moment,

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that it comes at you, take it.

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to keep showing up.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And in my books, I'm
incredibly honest,

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I had one in particular
that showed up three times.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the third time
came around, yeah, it stung.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It stung a lot.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But during that time,
it was the darkest time.

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
relationship, of course,

01:24:56.510 --> 01:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
because being an extrasensory,
we magnetize in the love space.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the most
spiritually beautiful time.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.730 align:middle line:10%
This was a time of
activation, my star family

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:08.990 align:middle line:10%
had returned again.

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
After a dark period
of being away.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So my star father comes in,
and it's a beautiful time

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and energetic space.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.995 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in
the quantum field

01:25:18.995 --> 01:25:23.990 align:middle line:84%
in that particular dimension,
there's not the human emotion.

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.690 align:middle line:90%
It's conveyed differently.

01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:30.680 align:middle line:10%
So he's standing at the foot
of my bed, and he's saying,

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.960 align:middle line:10%
OK, it's time for
you to activate.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, all right.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:35.970 align:middle line:90%
You gonna help me?

01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are we
going to do here?

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're going
to get out of your body.

01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, obviously, I
assume I know how to do this.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.510 align:middle line:90%
So I start trying.

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And I try, and I try and I
try, and I try and I try.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And, eventually, I come out.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I go back in,
and he said, it

01:25:54.710 --> 01:25:56.840 align:middle line:90%
took two beings to get you out.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.420 align:middle line:90%
He goes, stop thinking.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me, you cannot
think your way into situations.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The way you activate is
through your feelings,

01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
not through your mind.

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, you need to
decapitate yourself slightly--

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
not literally, please,
I don't invoke violence.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But start coming from
that heart space.

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
begin to activate.

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:27.610 align:middle line:84%
That same night, my partner,
he showed up as well.

01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And they created some
implants in my heart.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But in that process,
I actually died.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I left my body, and I had all of
the symptoms of a heart attack.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm leaving,
I thought, really?

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Right now?

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Um, don't I have things to do.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.910 align:middle line:90%
This is a kind of an odd timing.

01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't even
gotten to my work yet.

01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:50.600 align:middle line:10%
But, thankfully, they
put me back in my body.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point
that I realized, we all

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.510 align:middle line:90%
have the capacity to activate.

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But you have to decide, are
you going to consciously do it?

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just going
to unconsciously do it?

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to take
steps to get to that place?

01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to prepare for it?

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if we stay connected
to media, and newspapers,

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and TV shows, and kind
of numb ourself out,

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:16.940 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
delay that process.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Are you taking your
ego-dissolving moments?

01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Are you taking
advantage of those

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.720 align:middle line:90%
so that you can grow yourself?

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I only grew
through forgiveness

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.590 align:middle line:90%
of myself and others.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:29.790 align:middle line:90%
That was my human experience.

01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn to have
that human experience.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So the goal of all
of these beings

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and all these beautiful
beings and realms,

01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
is to teach us to start
stepping into our light body.

01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful experience.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It's magnetic.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's electric.

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
So try shaking hands with it.

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
to start actively

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.810 align:middle line:90%
moving into those fields.

01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It's completely available
to you, and it's beautiful.

01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at you
and I see you now,

01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
you are completely
capable of doing it,

01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.470 align:middle line:90%
but you have to step into it.

01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:07.772 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:07.772 --> 01:28:09.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:28:09.716 --> 01:28:13.604 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:13.604 --> 01:28:17.370 align:middle line:90%


01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I could go a whole
bunch of different ways.

01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:25.020 align:middle line:10%
But I think that--

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:30.870 align:middle line:10%
I was saying earlier, I think
there is a transformation

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.460 align:middle line:10%
that's occurring.

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And transformation
is occurring globally

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
in the morphogenetic
field, in the solar system,

01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and in the individuals
that makes up

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:51.600 align:middle line:90%
the morphogenetic field.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:59.790 align:middle line:10%
So in this transformation,
there is moments

01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:02.160 align:middle line:10%
that are fairly uncomfortable.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
don't feel like--

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
as you transform more
and more-- and that's

01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%
my experience anyway.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
They get worse and
worse, you know?

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:25.316 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that they become
more and more dramatic

01:29:25.316 --> 01:29:26.465 align:middle line:90%
in their impact.

01:29:26.465 --> 01:29:31.190 align:middle line:90%


01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And because you're evolving, you
get more and more of the tools

01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.190 align:middle line:90%
necessary to deal with it.

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that something that
would completely freaked me out

01:29:45.230 --> 01:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, occurs
to me now almost daily.

01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yeah, no worries.

01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm just going
to chop my head right

01:29:58.430 --> 01:30:01.778 align:middle line:90%
below the neck, and I'll be OK.

01:30:01.778 --> 01:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
regrow another one.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:10.370 align:middle line:90%


01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like--
for me anyway, it's

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
like you become somebody
that, from the outside,

01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
looks like they
have a thick skin,

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's not because you're
becoming more closed up,

01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and more isolated,
and more thick.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It's actually because you're
opening up more and more

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and trusting that
when you're open,

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:41.930 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
deal with anything

01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
that comes your way, right?

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to destroy you.

01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You're just going
to keep coming back.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're just
invincible, right?

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So you don't have to hide.

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be afraid.

01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:58.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be ashamed.

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You can go through all
the stuff you go through.

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And whether the
people around you

01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
can deal with it or not
is another issue, right?

01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You can just do
what you have to do.

01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And their opinion and their
judgment about you, that's

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:20.120 align:middle line:90%
their own affairs.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
That's none of your
business, right?

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:25.370 align:middle line:90%


01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:27.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's getting easier for me.

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is getting easier for
me, because I feel more of me.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And more of my heart,
center, more of my strength,

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:46.370 align:middle line:84%
more of my core, and I'm not
afraid to be who I am, right?

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And like that, I can
be OK with people

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:52.370 align:middle line:90%
disagreeing with who I am?

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And so that's, for me--

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.880 align:middle line:90%
really transformational.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
That's, for me, allowing
me to take something

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that maybe 20 years
ago was a goal

01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and make that goal possible.

01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm able to stand in
the middle of complete chaos

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and disarray and be
completely OK with it.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.570 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, isn't that a
testimony of the sacred

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.315 align:middle line:84%
masculine, coming
into his power?

01:32:30.315 --> 01:32:31.115 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

01:32:31.115 --> 01:32:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Hopefully.

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Working on it.

01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:35.616 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going to
start to wind this up.

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And hasn't that's
been an amazing panel?

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:44.660 align:middle line:10%
Such incredibly detailed,
focused, clear information

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:49.580 align:middle line:10%
on ascension, which is
such a complex process.

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to leave
by having everyone give

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:56.030 align:middle line:84%
their top tool on ascension
and maybe some resources

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that they have that they share
that you can benefit from in

01:32:59.390 --> 01:33:01.820 align:middle line:90%
only a minute or a little more.

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we're also going to
go into an ascension activation

01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not just
about talking about this.

01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is an
embodied experience

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that you can
experience and feel.

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:16.700 align:middle line:10%
And going into an
ascension activation

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.820 align:middle line:10%
is definitely a way to
raise your frequency

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.840 align:middle line:10%
and open yourself up to your
own guidance and messages.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But, for now, I'd like to go one
more round briefly in a minute,

01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:30.650 align:middle line:90%
a little over a minute.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Just share your
top tool and what

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to offer
that can help people

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.828 align:middle line:90%
in their ascension process.

01:33:38.828 --> 01:33:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're not
passionate and have hope,

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
bring that back
into your reality.

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it is about
looking at our frequency--

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:56.830 align:middle line:84%
our technology is
our consciousness.

01:33:56.830 --> 01:34:00.210 align:middle line:90%
So check in.

01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Analyze, evaluate, your
thoughts and your feelings.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.770 align:middle line:90%
They carry frequency.

01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we check in and
we evaluate ourselves,

01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:12.630 align:middle line:90%
we can slide the frequency.

01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:15.090 align:middle line:90%
We can change our state.

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And that will indeed
change our reality.

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
That allows us to snowball
in terms of our frequency.

01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Because this is about
high-frequency embodiment.

01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So taking deep responsibility
for the way we know who we are,

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and then taking
those necessary steps

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:44.640 align:middle line:84%
to choose consciousness
states that are indeed

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:52.890 align:middle line:84%
high frequency will even help
you to transform your wounds.

01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that taking
responsibility

01:34:56.430 --> 01:35:02.650 align:middle line:84%
makes this a complete
journey of transformation.

01:35:02.650 --> 01:35:05.940 align:middle line:90%
So your work is embodied.

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And that will ignite great
light and great life force.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
So my meditation practice is
every day, minute by minute,

01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:19.500 align:middle line:84%
so I can hold these
amazing frequencies

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:24.850 align:middle line:84%
so they're available to you,
to us on a day-to-day basis.

01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we hold
the high frequency baton,

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:33.125 align:middle line:84%
and we give that to each
person we meet in our lives.

01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:34.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Tracy.

01:35:34.388 --> 01:35:35.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:37.100 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Meg, what is your tool and
what do you have to offer?

01:35:40.822 --> 01:35:42.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I have found from
going through this process

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:47.260 align:middle line:10%
for the past 25 years that
our greatest wound is really

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.740 align:middle line:10%
our greatest gift.

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we can go into it, it
opens the door to our divinity.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And so from myself,
I share the practice

01:35:58.150 --> 01:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
that I was taught, working
closely with Archangel Metatron

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and using Metatron's Cube, not
only to activate the merkaba

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
torus, but also to
establish zero point,

01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and to open up
what's, basically,

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the quantum vortex energy around
the body and the aura to--

01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
it's an ascension tool that's
available to all of us.

01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It helps us clear out
all of the corrupted code

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and ancestral
lineage and trauma,

01:36:26.770 --> 01:36:31.600 align:middle line:84%
but it also can pull in, and it
helps pull the soul inside us.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And to pull the abundance
that's available to us.

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.762 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be teaching
this technique in two hours.

01:36:38.762 --> 01:36:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing a free lecture.

01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I would love to see you there.

01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to come, I'll walk
you through and demonstrate it.

01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But I also teach it online
and in webinars and videos

01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and work with clients privately.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So it is a complex package
available to everyone.

01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But one of the greatest
passions that I have

01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.700 align:middle line:84%
is also working on
shifting the planet,

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:01.940 align:middle line:90%
shifting the consciousness.

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I do monthly global
activations that are webcasts.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Everyone comes in from
all around the world,

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
lightworkers earth
keepers, grid workers,

01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and we work together to
not only shift ourselves

01:37:14.290 --> 01:37:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and activate ourselves,
but then together we

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:17.950 align:middle line:90%
create a group mind.

01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And we work on the collective.

01:37:20.410 --> 01:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
We increase the collective
with love frequency.

01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
We shift the dividing
separatism of duality.

01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's a chance for you to step
into the fields of the quantum

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
vortex with me on
a monthly basis

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and really do what your
purpose is here to do.

01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:41.380 align:middle line:84%
My website is
newearthcentral.com,

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'd just love
to hear from you

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and support you
in any way I can.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Lori?

01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:54.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, for the key tools,
I'd like to offer our--

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.600 align:middle line:10%
number one, I just want
to remind you the process

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.380 align:middle line:10%
that I share and help
others through is to--

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.260 align:middle line:10%
in terms of a linear process,
though it's not linear, is,

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:08.080 align:middle line:10%
number one, to identify
all of those aspects

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.960 align:middle line:10%
of our consciousness and
our limited reality that

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.450 align:middle line:10%
keep us stuck in an old
paradigm, which we can see

01:38:13.450 --> 01:38:16.690 align:middle line:10%
is collapsing, whether it's
conscious or unconscious,

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.710 align:middle line:10%
whether it's known
or unknown to us,

01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:22.150 align:middle line:10%
whether it's from this lifetime
or a parallel existence,

01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:26.140 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is that's keeping
us stuck and/or small,

01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:28.980 align:middle line:10%
and/or limited, and/or unhappy,
and/or struggling-- all

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.000 align:middle line:10%
of that, it's the
first thing we can all

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.900 align:middle line:10%
do within ourselves is to begin
to identify those things clear

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.750 align:middle line:10%
and resolve them in a way
that works right for us

01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:40.155 align:middle line:10%
by coming into attunement.

01:38:40.155 --> 01:38:41.530 align:middle line:10%
This is, really,
the second part,

01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:43.197 align:middle line:10%
is we come into
attunement and alignment

01:38:43.197 --> 01:38:45.140 align:middle line:10%
with the divinity
that is within us.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And we activate and awaken that
dormant potential within us,

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:51.850 align:middle line:10%
that's lying dormant,
and we systematically

01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:54.610 align:middle line:10%
and simultaneously
align with-- sometimes

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:56.770 align:middle line:10%
through what we call
downloads and certainly

01:38:56.770 --> 01:38:59.300 align:middle line:10%
through activations
that divinity within us.

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.450 align:middle line:10%
And we call in more
of our embodiments.

01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:02.620 align:middle line:10%
That's step 2.

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.860 align:middle line:10%
Step 3 is where we really
anchor into and align

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.220 align:middle line:10%
with this new paradigm
based on a fifth-dimensional

01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.860 align:middle line:10%
consciousness of peace,
love, and oneness.

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And we really anchor into that.

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an ongoing
process, of course.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.740 align:middle line:10%
And then number 4 is to become
really conscious co-creators

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.350 align:middle line:10%
for all of humanity, for
the greater good of all

01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:27.250 align:middle line:10%
of humanity-- servers of the
light, servers of the divine,

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:29.770 align:middle line:10%
severs of the evolution of
humanity for the greater

01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:32.650 align:middle line:10%
good of all, the highest and
best of all with harm to none.

01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So those four steps, I
hope that's helpful to you

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because we all have that
within us to follow.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.330 align:middle line:10%
I also want to say that a major
part of the work and service I

01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:44.290 align:middle line:10%
do is through DNA activations
and other sacred key code

01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:47.860 align:middle line:10%
activations and star
code-marking activations.

01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And you're certainly welcome to
get a free activation if you go

01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:59.080 align:middle line:10%
to my website,
lorispagna.com/freegifts/dna.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.330 align:middle line:10%
And we'll send you a free
class on how to do it.

01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:04.013 align:middle line:10%
And we'll send you a
gifted DNA activation.

01:40:04.013 --> 01:40:06.430 align:middle line:10%
And if you're wanting to know
more of your role as a light

01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:10.090 align:middle line:10%
worker, star seed, wayshower,
change agent for the greater

01:40:10.090 --> 01:40:13.030 align:middle line:10%
good of humanity, you can
also get an incredible class

01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and gifted e-book from
me at lorispagna.com/f

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.230 align:middle line:10%
reegifts/starseed.

01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:21.670 align:middle line:90%


01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:23.030 align:middle line:90%
You will love it.

01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And finally, I want to say
that we're doing actual DNA

01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:29.020 align:middle line:10%
activations today, sacred
key code activations

01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:32.260 align:middle line:10%
in the gifted workshop, free
workshop today, this afternoon,

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.982 align:middle line:10%
it's at 6:00 PM.

01:40:34.982 --> 01:40:36.190 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what room it is.

01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:37.630 align:middle line:10%
But it's Lori Spagna.

01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:43.710 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find it 6:00 PM
today, free workshop in Marina.

01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:44.758 align:middle line:10%
I hope to see you there.

01:40:44.758 --> 01:40:46.300 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, if
you're a believer,

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.660 align:middle line:10%
you will shift into a
knower once you start

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.272 align:middle line:10%
getting those activations.

01:40:50.272 --> 01:40:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you guys so much.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, thank you.

01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:53.530 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And Maureen.

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you asked this
a couple of things.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And before I speak to those,
I want to acknowledge--

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and I know all of you will
join me in acknowledging you,

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Debra Giusti, for
your hard work--

01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --and your incredible
research that you have done,

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:12.775 align:middle line:90%
creating this amazing list.

01:41:12.775 --> 01:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've worked with a
few of the people on the panel,

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.118 align:middle line:84%
but I am so in awe
of how much you

01:41:18.118 --> 01:41:19.410 align:middle line:90%
have done to be ready for this.

01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It's my life's mission.

01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:24.748 align:middle line:84%
>> And she is a
connector, by the way.

01:41:24.748 --> 01:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're not signed up
for her list, you should.

01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:28.415 align:middle line:84%
Because she's always
got this cool list

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.010 align:middle line:90%
called "Debra Recommends."

01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'll move on to
my list of top tools.

01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:36.940 align:middle line:84%
My number one top tool
right now is the 5D Merkaba.

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.518 align:middle line:84%
And that's available as a
CD download if you want.

01:41:40.518 --> 01:41:42.060 align:middle line:84%
You can learn it in
one of the books.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It's written out for you.

01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend the city.

01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I also teach people how to
open the Akashic records.

01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I do online courses, as
well as in-person classes.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.090 align:middle line:10%
And right now, I'm offering
a very special program

01:41:57.090 --> 01:42:04.110 align:middle line:10%
with another Akashic teacher
named Lumari, who is joining me

01:42:04.110 --> 01:42:07.380 align:middle line:10%
in a four-part event, where
we're training and giving

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:09.720 align:middle line:10%
information about what
the Akashic records are.

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is free if you will
buy her book or my book.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.530 align:middle line:10%
My book's going to come out in
April on the Akashic records.

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll save
yourself $300 if you

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.490 align:middle line:90%
want to do that for free.

01:42:20.490 --> 01:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to also give
you one other meditation.

01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who are in the
class with me, before this one,

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.453 align:middle line:84%
I did the golden
bowl meditation.

01:42:31.453 --> 01:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is activating
your sixth sense.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful
10-minute intro and then

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.860 align:middle line:84%
10-minute meditation
that you can

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:41.250 align:middle line:84%
give to anybody at any
level because it explains

01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:45.010 align:middle line:84%
from the ground zero all
the way up what it does

01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:46.260 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't frighten anyone.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it literally opens up
this channel around the body--

01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:53.080 align:middle line:84%
around the head, which is
called "the golden bowl."

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful,
wonderful tool,

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.130 align:middle line:90%
so I hope you avail yourself.

01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I always like
to give freebies.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.030 align:middle line:10%
So in my case, you
can write these down.

01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And many of you heard
me say this before--

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking for a day of
heaven on Earth for me

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and everyone I come
in contact with.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
changes everything.

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I also say a
prayer at night.

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.180 align:middle line:90%
I am waking up in 5D.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to
that prayer that I will

01:43:20.190 --> 01:43:21.660 align:middle line:90%
share with you in the books.

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:23.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Maureen.

01:43:23.875 --> 01:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and I should tell you
that you can get all of this

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.540 align:middle line:84%
material on my website
maureenstgermain.com.

01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You can get all my books
at Amazon as well--

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and CD Baby sells all my
guided meditations as well.

01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So have some fun.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And sign up for my
blog post, which

01:43:40.230 --> 01:43:43.980 align:middle line:84%
has important information
that's timely every month.

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It also comes with
a freebie as well.

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.206 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:43:49.206 --> 01:43:50.475 align:middle line:90%
And Alexa.

01:43:50.475 --> 01:43:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:55.170 align:middle line:10%
I would like to begin with
charging each one of you

01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:58.800 align:middle line:10%
with exquisite curation
of your consciousness.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you are a synthesis
of what goes into your field.

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So be mindful of what you
watch, who you spend time with,

01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:09.450 align:middle line:84%
what you're bringing in,
because that is who you are.

01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
My growth happened
with self-love,

01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:14.520 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness of self and others.

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Try experiencing that, too.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of the words you
say to yourself and others.

01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Practice experiencing
yourselves,

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.660 align:middle line:90%
practicing self-love with that.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It will be an amazing experience
if you really give it a shot.

01:44:28.570 --> 01:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I also practice interdimensional
experience healings,

01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.880 align:middle line:90%
where I hold a vortex space.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:36.480 align:middle line:90%
That's one of my gifts.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I found that gift only
through the challenge

01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of expressing love to
someone else in a very

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:43.620 align:middle line:90%
challenging moment.

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So I also charge
you with leaning

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.350 align:middle line:84%
into those experiences, those
ego-dissolving experiences.

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:middle line:10%
Because you don't know
what's waiting for you

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.850 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of that door.

01:44:53.850 --> 01:44:56.410 align:middle line:90%
My website is alexapearson.com.

01:44:56.410 --> 01:44:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I have numerous
articles on there

01:44:58.950 --> 01:45:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that discuss more
fully my experiences

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.520 align:middle line:84%
with other beings,
interdimensional beings, all

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.130 align:middle line:90%
of that subject matter.

01:45:08.130 --> 01:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Also, my books are available
on amazon.com and downstairs

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.430 align:middle line:84%
at booth 511, where I
will be signing books.

01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I've got two in the series right
now with me and more to follow.

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:21.876 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be with you.

01:45:21.876 --> 01:45:26.214 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:26.214 --> 01:45:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, Nassim, your top tool and
how they can reach you for more

01:45:29.710 --> 01:45:30.700 align:middle line:90%
studying with you.

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think my top tool
was given to me when I was 11.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way to
turn my senses inwards

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and connect with the
source of my existence,

01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:55.270 align:middle line:84%
like with the power
source within me.

01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
And I think any
meditation technique,

01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:01.090 align:middle line:10%
you can utilize or
concentration technique--

01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:05.750 align:middle line:10%
whatever, you don't have to call
it meditation, whatever works,

01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:10.210 align:middle line:10%
any focusing capability,
you can muster,

01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:14.410 align:middle line:10%
even if it's just five
minutes a day every day,

01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:17.080 align:middle line:10%
to turn your senses
inward and discover

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:24.790 align:middle line:10%
what's going on within you and
bring your awareness to center.

01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:27.020 align:middle line:10%
Then, it becomes
easier during the day

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:32.110 align:middle line:10%
when you get caught in the
spin to find center again

01:46:32.110 --> 01:46:35.860 align:middle line:10%
because you've been
there recently.

01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
one of my favorite tools.

01:46:40.570 --> 01:46:45.085 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a really good
companion through my life.

01:46:45.085 --> 01:46:47.840 align:middle line:90%


01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.420 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I've
developed technology,

01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:59.760 align:middle line:10%
some technology relates to what
the ladies we're talking about,

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:03.200 align:middle line:10%
and some of this technology
can be seen at our booth,

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.330 align:middle line:10%
at the art booth.

01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is a way to
amplify your field

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and increase the
amount of energy that's

01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:19.010 align:middle line:84%
able to move through your body,
through the changes that occurs

01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:23.990 align:middle line:84%
in the water molecule,
interaction with your biology

01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and your capacity to absorb
and to cleanse your body.

01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to check that
out, it's available to you

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:47:36.170 --> 01:47:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
a course online

01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that's called "Delegate
Program," which is really

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:45.740 align:middle line:84%
a course that goes
deep into understanding

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental concepts of
the physics that are emerging

01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in the world and the change
in worldview that's occurring.

01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And people that take
that course, most of them

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:02.990 align:middle line:84%
report vast changes
in their relationship

01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to themself and
their relationship

01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:08.600 align:middle line:84%
to the universe and their
understanding of reality

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and big changes in their
worldview in their own life.

01:48:12.670 --> 01:48:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think, if
you're interested,

01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:18.530 align:middle line:84%
it's something you
can participate with.

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have some 80 countries
involved, thousands of people

01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:26.210 align:middle line:84%
taking the course, and then
every month we connect,

01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and people can
ask me a question,

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and we discuss things.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
are tools for us

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move forward
and grow together, and explore

01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:46.870 align:middle line:84%
together, and discover,
and transform together.

01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I-- my
little piece that I'm

01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:52.625 align:middle line:90%
trying to bring into the world.

01:48:52.625 --> 01:48:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.020 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.770 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:07.072 align:middle line:90%
