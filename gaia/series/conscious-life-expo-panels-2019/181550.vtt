00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't this the 17th
Annual Conscious Life Expo?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fantastic.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we're
streaming worldwide by Gaia

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.803 align:middle line:90%

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So that means all my material
about Russia and China

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and stuff--

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I got to throw away.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.684 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the bar
waiting for this event to start,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:90%
not drinking.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And a guy comes in and sits down
near to the bartender and says,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:90%
sir, I don't have any money.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Can I have a drink?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And if I show you something
that you really like,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
can I have it for free?

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The bartender says, geez,
what am I going to do?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to reach
into my pocket

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:90%
to buy the poor guy a drink.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
He reaches into his pocket
and pulls a little piano,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:90%
a little tiny one.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Puts it on the bar.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:90%
And then he pulls out a hamster.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Sits the hamster
down by the piano.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And the hamster just
starts playing away.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Bartender says
that's pretty cool,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
about the free drink.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, what about this?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Reaches into his other pocket
and pulls out a little frog.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.765 align:middle line:90%
Frog starts singing.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:23.565 align:middle line:90%
Figaro!

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Figaro!

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.468 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Bartender says, you'll
get your free drink.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
A guy next to this
other guy comes

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:90%
running over with a $100 bill.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I want that frog.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Please, can I have him?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:90%
The guy says sure.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Takes the $100,
gives him the frog.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Guy puts the frog in his
pocket and he leaves.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.935 align:middle line:84%
The bartender says,
you're an idiot.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
He says, what do you
mean I'm an idiot?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
He says, you gave
away something that's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be worth
millions of dollars.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:90%
He said, nah.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
The hamster is a ventriloquist.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Life is very different, folks.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.448 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:90%
So what we're going to do--

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Tommy, you got the bell?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Smack it first.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Every contestant will
have up to two minutes

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
to answer their
specific question.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do several
rounds until the event is over.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
The same question each round.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And I have a bowl.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.898 align:middle line:84%
Serena, bring me the bowl, and I
will pick the first contestant.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you will address
from the middle, folks.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
The first contestant for our
cosmic question is Lisa Garr.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Lisa?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:42.995 align:middle line:90%
Bring it on.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.015 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:44.925 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.555 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tommy will give
you the question.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Lisa.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Bring it on.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Tommy.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good, Tommy.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm right here.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there you are.

00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa, if you were leaving
Earth to go live on the moon,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
what one item would you bring
and what one person would you

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:90%
bring and why?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:10%
You have two minutes.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I would bring--

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:10%
the item that I would
bring with me is my heart.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:10%
It's an item.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:10%
It's in my body.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:10%
But it would allow me
to take on whatever

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:10%
it is that I need
to learn on the moon

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:10%
in order to live and survive.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:10%
The people I would bring
with me is most likely

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:10%
my daughter and my
husband, because that's

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:10%
where my love is.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So the question was
one person and one item.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.283 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, come on now.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Just reading
what they gave me.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:10%
>> I like going outside
the box, though, Tommy.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
So I'm making my own rules.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, that's what I would
do is I would bring my heart.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I would bring my family.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And we would adventure together.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:10%
And we would
discover new realms.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:10%
And we would collectively
combine our minds

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:10%
in order to reach outside
of the origin that we're in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:10%
and travel
collectively together.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:10%
Because that tends to be
what we tend to do always

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:10%
is just go outside
of our own minds.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's all led from the heart.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.512 align:middle line:90%
So that is my answer to that.

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and
gentlemen, Lisa Garr.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.428 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And our next
contestant, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Rabbi?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And rabbi was telling us
because of something very--

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't touch.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You can announce.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the Sabbath.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> He can't touch
the microphone.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch the mic.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what we call in Hebrew
[SPEAKING HEBREW] so I can't do

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:90%
At least I can talk.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Question again, Tom.

00:04:41.938 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Rabbi, first of
all, how are you?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Baruch hashem.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank You.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us your favorite toy
as a kid and why you liked it.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> My favorite
toy as a kid, huh?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Boy, oh, boy.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:10%
I have two minutes.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:10%
Rabbis usually told to be
very quickly at the podium.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're leading
a synagogue service,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:90%
people don't have time.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
They always sit and watch.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's my way of
just wasting some time.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:10%
What would be my favorite toys?

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:10%
When I was a child, I
used to love building

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:10%
what are model airplanes.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how many
of you might remember.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:10%
Back in the day, Charlie Brown
and Snoopy and the Red Baron--

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:10%
well, he was
fighting [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:10%
the head of [INAUDIBLE]
and who fought--

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
who flew the Fokker
Dr.1 triplane.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Well, somehow,
someway that always

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:10%
had a meaning and
a message to me.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some karmic
connection there.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:90%
My warrior past.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But since I was
very, very young,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:90%
I always built model airplanes.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:10%
Maybe something having to
do with going to the skies,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:10%
flying, freedom, strength, all
those things which eventually

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:10%
materialized in both
my marshal as well

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:10%
as spiritual traditions.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.378 align:middle line:10%
That pretty much sums it up.

00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Did that in two minutes, right?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, the rabbi.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Did that well.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you did.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:90%
No dings.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And by the way, Israel
through his SpaceX--

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk's company just
launched a lander to the moon.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:90%
But we were ahead by 50 years.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Our next contestant--

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%
David Adair--

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Rocket Man who, by
the way, is moving.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:10%
Can we tell people this?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, he'll be alright.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> He's moving
full time to Egypt.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:10%
That's not part of
your two minutes.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.823 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say--

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:54.623 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> David, how are you?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty good.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> You have two minutes.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us what makes
animals so lovable.

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know they have--

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Who came up with
these questions?

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> The committee.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Animals have
like a sixth sense.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Most of them do.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Their instincts are
king, so perfectly edged.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And they have an insight real
quick. 'Cause in the wild,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:10%
you only get split
seconds to make sure

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:10%
that you either got a friend
or foe you're dealing with.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.023 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
time to think about it.

00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So when they encounter us,
that's the first thing they do.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:90%
They just scan us like radars.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:10%
And they're trying to figure out
what kind of nature of a person

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:10%
you are.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And there are-- you're right.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
They're so lovable.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.095 align:middle line:10%
You ever wonder why you
spell God backwards?

00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:10%
And what's it spell?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:10%
Dog.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:10%
There's a reason for that.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.365 align:middle line:10%
That's the only animal
on Earth that practice

00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:52.465 align:middle line:10%
unconditional to man.

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:10%
You can beat it, and it
keeps coming back to you.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:10%
So they have an incredible
sense of ability

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:10%
to read you and understand you.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:10%
And they make their
decisions based on that.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And you can feel it.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:10%
You ever look at a puppy
or kitten in the face?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:10%
It's more than innocent.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:10%
It just really likes you.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And you can feel that.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:10%
They project those
kind of energy waves,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:10%
because they have to in a wild.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:10%
'Cause like I said, they
only got split seconds

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:10%
to make friends or
enemies real quick.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:10%
So that's why
they're so lovable,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:10%
'cause if you're a nice person,
they're going to like you.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> David Adair.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.573 align:middle line:90%
>> David, stay there for a sec.

00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:90%
David, stay there for a sec.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Couple questions.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
By the way, David
loves dogs so much,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
he's been licking
my face all day.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Why are you moving to Egypt?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're all
going to love this.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
As he said, two days
ago, Israel just

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:90%
shot a satellite to the moon.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It's going to soft impact,
I think, March or April 18.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:58.125 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
going on out in the world

00:08:58.125 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:90%
you're not aware of.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Countries are
mobilizing the stuff.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
The Middle East is more like
United States, this united

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:90%
country there now.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:10%
They're all working together.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Middle East has
a new space program.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.822 align:middle line:90%
Guess who's going to direct it?

00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:14.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

00:09:14.664 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Very first thing
we're going to do--

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
we're going back to the moon.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And guess who the first
astronaut will be that David is

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
sending?

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy Church.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:90%
I arranged it.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.104 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:31.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, David.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.617 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:09:32.617 --> 00:09:33.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, David.

00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a note from
Jimmy, by the way.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>> One way.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Ms. Grace.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Sonja Grace.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Good one.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.204 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Tommy, where are you?

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here, Sonja.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.105 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there you are.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Look down.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Sonja?

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get a
little more heavy here.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I'm ready.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how you would
convince someone

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that is suicidal that life
is joyous and worth living.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there is a group groan
that just happened behind me.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard one.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And we all know
how difficult it is

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
when someone's on that edge
to not only go in and throw

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
them a rope, but pull them out.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing that I

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
have discussed with
clients in this position

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:90%
is that we all have karma.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:10%
We've all incurred
karma for lifetimes.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we're here
is we're working that out.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So to commit suicide
takes us out of that loop.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we are out of that
loop and on the other side,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
we're literally living out
this lifetime as if we're still

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
alive, but we have no body.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's very difficult to do.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people when they
are suicidal to remember

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
they have karma, and they're
here to work that out.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I also remind people
that they are loved.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the one thing
that's missing for many of us

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in our lives is we need to know
we're loved, we're cared for,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that we matter, and
that we're heard.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to end this on,
I love you all and I hear you,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Sonja Gray.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.815 align:middle line:90%
She made it by 30 seconds.

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:41.994 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Has anybody ever had
a close person, a friend,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
a family member that
committed suicide?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend
that did that, too.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a sportscaster
in Detroit where

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I was an executive producer.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And I moved to St. Louis.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on trying to
get him hired as a sportscaster

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And he had gotten
fired in Detroit,

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:90%
so he was very depressed.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And he would call every day.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And one day he called.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that he
seemed more depressed

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:90%
than the other calls.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, can
you wire me $350?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.085 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of money.

00:12:20.085 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, of course.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.605 align:middle line:90%
His name was Red Jamison.

00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said sure, Red.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.313 align:middle line:90%
I'll send it to you.

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:90%
So I wired him $350.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
The next day he apparently
was found hanged in his hotel,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:84%
but had paid his
insurance, which was $350.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my God.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's unbelievable.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.176 align:middle line:90%
And you think about all that.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my God.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Next up--

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Nassim Haramein.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.045 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:45.045 --> 00:12:47.682 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.682 --> 00:12:48.765 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you doing, sir?

00:12:48.765 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, on the grill.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Nassim, you have two minutes.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Name something human
beings take for granted

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that would be sorely
missed if we didn't have.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Space.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.553 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You got two minutes, man.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got two hours, Nassim.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.274 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.274 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> --should we go
through the equations?

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we typically think
of space as a given,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:90%
like it gets there.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is like nothing
you have to worry about.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And turns out that
space is not empty.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:90%
It's full of information.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's present everywhere.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
At the atomic level
of your existence,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:84%
you're made out of
99.9999999% space.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The rest is just a little
bit of a fluctuation

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
you call yourself.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And it might fluctuate
stronger at certain time

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and not as strong as the others.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.012 align:middle line:84%
And these fluctuations
of information

00:14:01.012 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is exchanging with the
space continuously.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
forget about that.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We forget that there is
something remarkable happening,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that like there's a 100 trillion
cell in our body that are made

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
out of 100 trillion atoms each.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And that like all--

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
there's like I
think 1,000 billion,

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
billion chemical change every
second for all that to work.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a bloody
miracle that you're alive

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
every billionth of a
second that occurs.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we
have a tendency

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to forget the miracle of
life and the space that

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:90%
makes it possible.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Nassim.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Nassim, I had a physicist
on "Coast to Coast"

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
a couple nights ago.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him that
obvious question--

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:90%
how do we all start?

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:90%
How did this begin?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I have no idea.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Are we ever going
to get that answer?

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I just wrote a paper on it.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was your results?

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Cosmological genesis.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Their result was that it's--

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
well, it just got
accepted, by the way,

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in a very good physics
journal for publication--

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> 'Good for you.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.688 align:middle line:84%
>> --which just
passed peer review.

00:15:23.688 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited about that--

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:90%
two days ago.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And it says that the
universe is a continuous loop

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of information that creates
universes, upon universes,

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:90%
upon universes.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Universes foam out
other universes.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> How did the first one start?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no beginning.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> See, I can't get that answer.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.398 align:middle line:90%
>> It's continuous.

00:15:51.398 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, the physics
magazine that published them

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.523 align:middle line:84%
was called "Mad" magazine,
just so you know.

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:56.752 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:56.752 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this was
going to be a roast, too.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:90%
But what the heck?

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
On May 11, I'm going to have
a live show in Columbus, Ohio.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of our great guests who
will be in attendance with me

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:90%
will be Billy Carson.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Billy?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.348 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:16.348 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Billy, welcome to
the podium of truth.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If you get any taller,
we're going to have to get

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
an extender on the microphone.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.848 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:28.848 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Billy, what do you
consider two of the most noble

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:90%
professions and why?

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:90%
You have two minutes.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Two of the most noble
professions, I believe,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
right now are to me,
breakthrough professions that

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
are going to be probably taught
in universities all around

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.435 align:middle line:84%
And it would be archaeoastronomy
and astroanthropology.

00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And archaeoastronomy--
thank you.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe as you're
studying space anomalies

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at space
data, science data that

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
is given, handed down by
verified space agencies.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And you're analyzing that data.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally
an archaeologist,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:90%
but you're analyzing space data.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to extrapolate
different types of anomalies

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
or things that don't exist,
things that shouldn't be there,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
or information in the data
that spikes and raises

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
a lot of questions.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.689 align:middle line:84%
And these questions can
help humanity answer a lot

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of our own questions here
on Earth like, are we alone?

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why that's
one of the most important.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Another one is
astroanthropology.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're actually
finding these anomalies,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.952 align:middle line:84%
analyzing them, and
then now tracking down

00:17:41.952 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
these ancient civilizations
that have been left over,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
not only on Earth, but also
all around the solar system,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
proving that we had an
intergalactic or at least

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:84%
interplanetary, at least,
in this solar system,

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.812 align:middle line:84%
I believe galactic
civilization that

00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
was here a very,
very long time ago

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and may still be here right now.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're analyzing
this science data.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to extrapolate
what type of people

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.472 align:middle line:84%
they were, how they
lived, what they did.

00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of
evidence here on Earth

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
different types of skulls

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that have been found by great
researchers like Brien Foerster

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And people have traveled all
around the world like Erich von

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Daniken and analyzed
these things in person.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I've kind
of taken myself now,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to go out, analyze
these places, and look

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.255 align:middle line:84%
at some of these
ancient research,

00:18:25.255 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and be able to compare it to
some of the space anomalies,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and figure out who
these people were

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and what they did in
the ancient times.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Billy.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, Billy, you made
it by seven seconds or you were

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:90%
going to be done.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy, question.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Question for you.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think of the
Zecharia Sitchin theory,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki came
here, seeded whatever was

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.947 align:middle line:84%
on the planet at the
time, and here we are?

00:18:50.947 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Zecharia's system was one
of the greatest researchers

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
in the history of mankind
in my personal opinion.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Was he absolutely 100% correct
on everything and he stated?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:90%
No, but is anybody?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It's called research.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you start off at one
point, you get from point A

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
to point B.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes between
point A to point B,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.882 align:middle line:90%
It's up to interpretation.

00:19:12.882 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
people don't realize

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:84%
is Zecharia Sitchin's
theories came

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
from work that was
actually translated

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
not by him, but by many other
scholars hundreds of years

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.617 align:middle line:90%
before he was even born.

00:19:24.617 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
Enuma Elish, and the seven

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:84%
types of creation,
the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:90%
the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
These works were
translated long before him.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
took these works.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
He extrapolated information
from these works,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and from the Kabbalah, and from
the Torah, and from the Bible,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.397 align:middle line:84%
and from the Nag Hammadi,
and everything else

00:19:41.397 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:90%
he could get his hands on.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to paint
a picture for us.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.272 align:middle line:84%
And the overall
underlying story seems

00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to be the same thing, George.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And that story is that
a very long time ago,

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
beings either evolved
Earth and came

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.433 align:middle line:84%
to a high-level
civilization and genetically

00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
modifying the existing
hominid on this planet.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Or beings came from
another planet, maybe

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
potentially our space
brothers, our cousins,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and came here to this planet
to mining for resources

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and then at some point began
in a genetic manipulation

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
of the existing
hominid on this planet.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that they
created human beings.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Or, well, they genetically
modified a hominid,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
creating what we call a Homo
sapien in my personal opinion

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and to be used, unfortunately,
for slave race purposes.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they wanted
to go with AI technology.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look into
the Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
you realize that they did
have an android in that story.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But they themselves
were very smart

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and realized that if you had
a whole race of these AIs,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.078 align:middle line:90%
they may supersede them.

00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:43.245 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to create
something that was actually

00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more dumbed down.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
took our ancient ancestor,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:90%
the existing hominid.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think that they
disconnected the DNA, turned

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
down a lot of our
extrasensory perception,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
including shrinking our pineal
gland, making us actually,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, a
little bit dumber.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that ancient man
was much more intelligent

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:90%
than the current modern-day man.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%
That's my personal opinion.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Billy Carson,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Billy.

00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:09.925 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I had the honor
several years ago

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of awarding the late Zecharia
Sitchin the Conscious Life Expo

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Lifetime Achievement Award.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And he had just
turned 90 years old.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And in front of
the massive crowd

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.202 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mr. Sitchin,
how old are you?

00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And looked me in the eyes and
went, George, that's very rude.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.328 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Only Zecharia could do that.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Our next contestant
heads up earthfiles.com.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
She's our investigative reporter
at "Coast to Coast AM--"

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.835 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:49.835 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Howdy, Linda.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Linda, you have two minutes.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe
to your unborn daughter

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
the journey she is
about to embark on?

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda is not pregnant, by
the way, just so you know--

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> That the most valuable thing
that she could learn or go

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
into light with was knowing the
power, and the strengthening,

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and healing aspect of
photons in this universe.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to teach her
how every morning of her life

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on
entangling with photons.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And that entangling with
photons comes this big irony.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
From the point of
view of a photon

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:84%
traveling at 186,000 miles
a second in this universe,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.716 align:middle line:90%
there's only one photon.

00:22:49.716 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And at 186,000 miles a
second, there's no time,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and there's no space.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So that when you
entangle mentally,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
physically with
photon light, you

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
are entangling with a place
that has no time and no space.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I found it to be the
most strengthening thing

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:90%
that I have done in my life.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.487 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
would tell my daughter.

00:23:19.487 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda Moulton Howe,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.556 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda, you are hailed not
only on "Coast to Coast,"

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
but worldwide as one of
the greatest investigative

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
researchers and reporters
out there today.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%
You have a tenacity
about yourself

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:90%
where you just don't give up.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
When you started into this field
back in Denver, for example,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
what was it that got you so
interested in this field?

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Back then in the '70s, those
of us in news had to deal with

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:90%
cameras and Nagras.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
The Nagra is operated on
crystal sync with the cameras.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you were
out in the field,

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:84%
you had to work
like a ballet team.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd have two men, one with
a Nagra, one with the camera

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:90%
and me.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would have to
move around whatever

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we were doing, because
the camera and the audio

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:90%
were umbillicalled together.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't do anything
if the camera man and/or

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the audio didn't have what are
called battery packs that they

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:90%
wore around their waist.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And a man that I work
with all the time--

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I told him you've got
to have at least 8

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:84%
to 10 battery packs
charged at all times.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we never
know what we're going

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to be up against, because
I was doing documentaries.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was that audio
man sitting at lunch one

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
day on one project
who said, I've

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
just come off of a
shoot of a new program

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:90%
in New York called "20/20."

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:84%
He says, Linda,
you know how you're

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:84%
a stickler for me to have
all these battery packs.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, so the ABC crew--
they hired me on to do audio.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And we would get out
to Kansas and Oklahoma.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And there'd be this dead animal.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And we would come with the
camera, and nothing would work.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
The camera wouldn't work.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
The Nagra wouldn't work.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We'd walk 50, 100 feet
away from the animal,

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:90%
and everything would work.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We'd walk back to the animal,
and everything would stop.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what caught my attention.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
That is what I wanted to
answer in the beginning.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
What in the world would be
taking down battery belts?

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And look at what
those 40 years have

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
evolved, from trying to find out
what happened to those battery

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:90%
belts.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.803 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:50.803 --> 00:25:52.246 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:52.246 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next panelist
is a unique individual.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
This person died several times,
came back to talk about it.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Noted author.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
One of his books is called
"Saved by the Light."

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
many of you know this,

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
but we almost lost this
individual a few months ago.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.415 align:middle line:84%
This individual continues
to go to these events.

00:26:26.415 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be
in our live show

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
in Everett, Washington in
March, comes to these events.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Never complains.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:90%
He's always there.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
He is functioning as I
speak with 15% of his heart.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Folks, Dannion Brinkley.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:84%
This deserves a standing
ovation, folks, if you can.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.787 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:26:52.787 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Dannion Brinkley.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> This is why I come.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> They just--

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --keep sending
you back, don't they?

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's because
I started out, George,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill a part of
what I think is a vision.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:16.900 align:middle line:10%
And I want to finish
that task, like all of us

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:10%
have a mission or a purpose
in our life [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Or if we don't, we haven't
paid attention to what that is.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about it since 1975.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:90%
I've talked about it.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.867 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the final stages
of what I set out to do.

00:27:30.867 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:90%
The first thing is accomplished.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm in the final stages.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So dying is not going to keep
me from getting up and finishing

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We all have to realize this,
that my heart is at 15%.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But I understand
electrically how we work.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> You're all heart.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's how come I
can get up from the dead.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Dannion.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Tony.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion, we would like you
to act like you sell healing

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:90%
stones for a living.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And convince us to
buy the variety pack.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
You have two minutes.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Who does these questions?

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, everybody.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> We got a follow-up for you.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I happen to have a
crystal in my pocket.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I have carried this crystal
in my pocket now for 31 years.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I came across crystals,
because I went to the World

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Psychotronic Conference.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And I met this guy
named Marcel Vogel.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was going on this pattern
about how crystals grow out

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:90%
of dirt.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a rock that
grows out of dirt.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And is it a very important
item to have in your life?

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:10%
The original radio was
one of these shaved down

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:10%
to a certain frequency,
electricity running through it.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And you would send a metal
frame between two crystals.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And you would be able to pick
up radio frequency, something

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that Tesla talked
about, something

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
that Einstein talked about.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Marconi did not
invent the radio.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:90%
It was Tesla.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And Marconi took
11 Tesla patents.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So to have a crystal
that stores memory,

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to have a crystal that
actuate the beauty of how

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the Earth molds and creates
an energetic pattern

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:90%
about crystals.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So why I should think you
should have the battery pack

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
is because you are made up
of layers of beautiful being.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
You are great
powerful and mighty

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:84%
spiritual being with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the world is
driven based on that.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a finite
nature of who we are.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Then to keep that
unfinite beauty

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings in place,
we need the variety pack,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
one that makes us pay
attention to breathing.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Another makes us pay
attention to loving.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Another pays attention
to be appreciative.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Another one to pay
attention to be admired.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And another to pay attention
to make us inspirational.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So on top of that,
I can get my ass up

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
from the dead with
the crystal pack.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion, no,
don't go anywhere.

00:30:11.295 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't go anywhere, Dannion.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't go back.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Dannion, we got one more.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.165 align:middle line:90%
>> One more question.

00:30:15.165 --> 00:30:17.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Dannion, come on back.

00:30:17.203 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to have a
little fun with you there,

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:90%
so we have a follow-up question.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I can take it.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion, we'd like you to
describe two ways we can make

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:90%
our souls feel good.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:84%
First, look in the mirror
and give that person you

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:90%
see a big kiss.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Because what we have created
as an identity is not

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:90%
our true spiritual self.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:90%
We have become aware.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We have decided to be what
everybody else most would

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:90%
like about us.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've molded our
identities into something

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:90%
we hope pleases other people.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:10%
And in pleasing them, that
they're going to like us,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:10%
and we feel connected, OK?

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, what makes
your soul happy is

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to be of service, to be
able to think in terms of we

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and us instead of "I."

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:14.830 align:middle line:84%
The big trap is when it's I, I,
I, instead we, we, us, and us.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I know from six of
these experiences--

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
six of them-- that
we are connected.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We are connected in a way
that cannot be described as we

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
individually seem
to see ourselves.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:90%
But remember this.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Every action you take
affects everyone else.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Every energetic pattern that
you think affects everyone else.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So what makes your soul happy
is helping us, helping we.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you kiss
yourself in the mirror

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and you go out and make a
difference in somebody's life,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:90%
the soul celebrates.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it
flows like clouds forming.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It rolls outward and outward.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And someone else felt
the love that you gave

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and the support that you gave.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And with not their
own consciousness,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
did the same thing and made
a difference in their life.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes the soul
happy, to be of service.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And one last thing.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:10%
When you come to
this reality, we

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:10%
think about God and divinity.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, think of this, everybody.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you hope
God is-- loving, comparing,

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:84%
compassionate,
protective, supportive,

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
being there for you--

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
how many times a day do you
get a chance to be just that?

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
you have all the skill

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
sets to be loving, caring,
compassionate, and supportive

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:84%
in your life, that
makes your soul happy.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And think of this.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:90%
We can create living birth.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:84%
We live in a planet
in a dimension

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that we have the greatest
power to create life

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and to seek to understand
how that life sustains.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.337 align:middle line:90%
And that makes our soul happy.

00:32:58.337 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Dannion Brinkley.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:00.386 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:00.386 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion, I went to
kiss myself in the mirror,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.034 align:middle line:90%
and he turned his cheek.

00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:12.022 align:middle line:84%
>> But Jesus said
something about that.

00:33:12.022 --> 00:33:13.513 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.606 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:33:18.606 --> 00:33:20.106 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to turn
the other cheek.

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Turn the other cheek.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next contestant and
panelist is somebody I have

00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:27.945 align:middle line:84%
gotten to know through
Gaia's "Cosmic Disclosure--"

00:33:27.945 --> 00:33:28.745 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith.

00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Emery?

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.312 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:30.312 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emery.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Tom.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, what is the most
unselfish act you've done

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:90%
within the last month?

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I gave away a device
I've been working on for seven

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
years to a major corporation
to get it off my hands that had

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to deal with over-unity, so they
could get it out to the world

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:90%
in a very safe manner.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
opportunity to develop

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:84%
new things and new technologies
that I'm basically giving away

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to corporations.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:10%
So at least it will
get out to the public

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:10%
faster, and eventually help cure
everyone here, and also help,

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:10%
of course, cure the planet
and clean up the oceans.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So I write reports and
briefings and send them

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to special scientific
organizations

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and kind of give them a
little help, a little push.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm a problem solver.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:10%
And they contact
me, because they've

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:10%
been seeing me on
these shows at Gaia,

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:10%
and other shows, and other
radio shows, of course.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
just I'm here to serve.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to tell my story.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not here to
convince anyone of anything.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just letting you
all know I've got your back.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I got the planet's back.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to help everyone.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Emery Smith.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, if the public really
understood what was going

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:84%
on, how flipped
out would they get?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everyone here would
be perfectly fine with it.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.150 align:middle line:10%
Everyone.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem is once
the truth does come out

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:84%
about what's under
Antarctica and all

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
these ancient civilizations
you've been hearing--

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.440 align:middle line:90%
my colleagues here speak of--

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:84%
it will disrupt a lot of
people's belief systems,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
especially organized religion
and the history that we've been

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:90%
taught since we were children.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are going to be some
perturbed people out there

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have a difficult
time, because they were raised

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:90%
this way their entire life.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, you just
were told the truth.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And your whole life of
learning the education

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
of the history of the
planet, and the solar system,

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and much other things
has been a complete lie.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.410 align:middle line:84%
They've been
holding back from us

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time, over a
hundred years now, since Tesla,

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:90%
and suppressing us.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing is
ever since I came forward,

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:84%
many, many patents and
many new materials--

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:90%
over 50 of them--

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
the corporations
are now releasing.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So the corporations are
listening to all of us

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and all of you.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for all
your support, by the way.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for all of you.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And that being said means
it's in the right direction.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's not think of
the gloom and doom.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's look to the
future and look

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to the stars, and our brothers
and sisters in the stars,

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and get ready for it.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it is coming, and
it's coming very soon.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.572 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:11.572 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next panelist is the
Italo-American journalist who

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:27.820 align:middle line:84%
gives personally many of her
own resources for working

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:90%
on disclosure--

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Paola Harris.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Go, Paola.

00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:32.385 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:36.898 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.898 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola, you have two minutes.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Can we change our karma?

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The first thing I'm
going to say is the truth.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I do not know.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But I will give you an opinion,
because I deal in more nuts

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and bolts kinds of
things where I can

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:90%
answer a question that I know.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Do I think that we
can change our karma?

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because that
would mean that we

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:90%
have control over our lives.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I would not believe that we
got ourselves into some cycle

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that we'd have to complete a
good act to fix an evil one.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that our
souls or whoever we are

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:10%
is flexible enough
to learn a lesson

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:10%
and not to have to
do the whole thing,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.650 align:middle line:10%
that maybe there is
a mechanism that you

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:10%
have to do this whole thing to
kind of fix some kind of karma.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're
powerful beings.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I believe we're divine beings.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I believe the sky is the limit.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.496 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to
teach our children this.

00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And, Paola, let
me ask you this.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You do this to get
to the answers.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:90%
You do this for the truth.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:90%
You do this personally.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I know this personally.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:90%
What keeps you going?

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I just want to know.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw the film "Close
Encounters," as you know.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was around with
Linda in the '70s,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.500 align:middle line:84%
because we both
were at a conference

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.733 align:middle line:90%
where Dr. Heimlich came.

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And my presentation
is going to be

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:84%
on all the paranormal
stuff that happened

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:90%
to me after that, that led me.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Because all you have to
do is, I want to know.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get the answer.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take you to
places where you will find out.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The question is, you have
to ask the question first,

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you will start
getting the answers.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So all I said when I was
watching "Close Encounters" is,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.430 align:middle line:90%
is this real?

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So somebody, something, or
an infinite consciousness

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:90%
said, you want to know?

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take you on
this journey for 40 years.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're still
on this journey.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, keep doing it.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep doing it.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Paola Harris.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our last
panelist for this round--

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into a second
round in just a moment,

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
is one of the world's
foremost researchers

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
into the mysteries
of humankind--

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Grant Cameron.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Grant?

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.920 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Tommy.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Grant.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.447 align:middle line:84%
>> You got a good
question for me?

00:40:31.447 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I paid you lots of money.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let's see.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Grant, what in your opinion
is the most powerful thing

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.690 align:middle line:90%
in our universe?

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And please explain.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Consciousness.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So people always
want to turn it.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a
materialistic world,

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
we always want to
turn it into a noun.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.930 align:middle line:90%
We want to say there's levels.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:90%
There's us.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:90%
There's them.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.200 align:middle line:90%
There's this and that.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had a download
about two years ago.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And part of it said
that it's all a verb.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not a noun, that when you
try to change it into a noun.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that consciousness,
the sort of the ground of being

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:90%
is all there is.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
We want to put other
things and level things.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
This is more important than this
and all these kind of things.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
it's all this field

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that turns into matter, that
is the ground of everything.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And I had to flip in 2012.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.055 align:middle line:84%
I always make the joke that
before 2012, I probably

00:41:29.055 --> 00:41:30.430 align:middle line:84%
couldn't dispelled
consciousness,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't of cared less.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And I had this experience.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people in this panel

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:84%
have had these
experiences where you

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
have these experiences that
come with absolute knowing,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:90%
where you know.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to question.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I know this is for real.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to test it.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:84%
It comes with
absolute certainty.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.298 align:middle line:90%
And it flips your whole life.

00:41:47.298 --> 00:41:48.673 align:middle line:84%
And now, I know
what that feeling

00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:50.443 align:middle line:84%
is like when that's
coming, when you're

00:41:50.443 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
getting some sort of answer.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.443 align:middle line:84%
I believe it all comes
out of consciousness.

00:41:53.443 --> 00:41:55.870 align:middle line:84%
The more I look
at it, the less I

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.460 align:middle line:84%
talk about anything
that's matter.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
if you understand

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.937 align:middle line:84%
the true nature
of consciousness,

00:42:04.937 --> 00:42:06.270 align:middle line:90%
everything starts to make sense.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.395 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened to me.

00:42:07.395 --> 00:42:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Because in 2012, I had already
been at it for almost 40 years.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was in it, but I
really was depressed.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't-- like
your wheels are spinning.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:90%
You're not going anywhere.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
like putting

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:25.042 align:middle line:84%
on glasses when that revelation
came, that it's basically--

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and first, I thought it
was just consciousness.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized it was
non-local consciousness.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- basically, it
said this is how it works.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was just absolutely--

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I cannot express how much
that changed my life.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.795 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:39.795 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And, Grant, let me ask you.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You are one of the world's
greatest researchers.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Like Paola, like Linda,
and so many others.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't give up.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:84%
What's that one question
you would love answered

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.110 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't gotten yet?

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The one question-- you're
safe from the government.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:90%
And if it was for the--

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.175 align:middle line:84%
>> It's your choice,
that one question.

00:43:09.175 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess it would be the
question that Bret Oldham asked

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.370 align:middle line:90%
the tall grey.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.472 align:middle line:84%
He said, what's
your concept of God?

00:43:23.472 --> 00:43:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be
the ultimate thing,

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:90%
is that, what's it all mean?

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:84%
What's the answer
to the God question?

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.315 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

00:43:35.315 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
else is just sort of

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:90%
like a chapter in the book.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's that basic
understanding that we are--

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and the more I go through
my life since 2012,

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the more I realize that
you're in this Super

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Bowl of all stories.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And that I try to say thank
you three times every day,

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that I realize this is
the biggest story ever.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people are walking
around living lives

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:90%
of quiet desperation.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.487 align:middle line:10%
And it's this whole concept that
most people when they think I'm

00:44:01.487 --> 00:44:03.070 align:middle line:10%
coming to a UFO
Conference, they think

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:10%
you're exchanging photographs
and stuff like that.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I say no, it's never
about UFO photographs.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:10%
It's always people like
Sid and I sitting together.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting there and
talking about, what's God?

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:90%
What's the concept?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It always goes back to that
same discussion in the bars

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:90%
and in the coffee shops.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It's that thing about,
why are we here?

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.080 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on?

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are so valued,
because we are in the game.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We actually know there's
a question to be answered.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.317 align:middle line:84%
Most people just wait
until somebody says,

00:44:31.317 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:90%
you've got three months to live.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they suddenly
go, oh, my God.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:34.810 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And they start
running around trying

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:90%
to figure out why they were.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We are basically
spending our entire life,

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to answer that
question about, what is God?

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Grant.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.273 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:46.273 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, Gaia is
streaming this live worldwide.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
One of the executive producers--

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Sid Goldberg.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Sid, stand up.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Say hi.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.094 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:58.094 --> 00:45:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sid.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So we will begin to round
two with Emery Smith.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.609 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, what is the most
mysterious place you've visited

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and why?

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Next question.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.255 align:middle line:90%
>> The Life Conscious Expo.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.667 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> He's pretty good on his feet.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a tough one.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been on
many different missions

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and many different
places, places

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that I was not even allowed
to know where I was at.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was nothing like
I've seen on planet Earth.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And they all had something
special about it.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:50.632 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like when you go
on vacation around the world.

00:45:50.632 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:84%
People always ask
me, well, where's

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:56.050 align:middle line:84%
the best place you've
been around planet Earth?

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And every place I've visited
in all the countries--

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.090 align:middle line:84%
there's always something
special about something

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:90%
in that country.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to say that all
the places that I've been to,

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it been
underground facilities

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:13.690 align:middle line:84%
or different atmosphere
facilities that

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:84%
are living biological
pockets in the Earth.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I was on another planet
that some of my colleagues

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.490 align:middle line:90%
have kind of insinuated.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:90%
But I do not know exactly.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But I what I do know is there
is life beyond this planet.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
life within this planet.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
beautiful things

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever seen in
my entire life and career

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.660 align:middle line:84%
was due to traveling
to these areas

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and visiting these
areas, wherever they were

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and seeing and having
hope that the Earth is not

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the only place that
has beautiful life that

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:01.960 align:middle line:90%
can sustain us.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's really
important for that information

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to come out to the public
and to allow people

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to know that not only
are there beautiful

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.240 align:middle line:84%
places out there that we
can visit through the stars

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.685 align:middle line:84%
or through the Earth,
but they're habitable,

00:47:19.685 --> 00:47:20.485 align:middle line:90%
and they're safe.

00:47:20.485 --> 00:47:21.537 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGING]

00:47:21.537 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Our first two minutes are up.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Our first bell.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.465 align:middle line:90%
>> First ever.

00:47:25.465 --> 00:47:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I think he should continue.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Should he continue, folks?

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So that being said, we need
to get this information out,

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
disinformation out there

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:43.630 align:middle line:84%
on the net and things
about these places.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.190 align:middle line:90%
But they do exist.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And the governments and the
corporations, actually--

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:84%
the governments are
more just the security

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:84%
for the corporations,
so you know.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the facilities
that are underground

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:84%
are actually on bases, like
Sandia Labs is on Kirtland Air

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Force Base.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But Kirtland Air
Force Base is just

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.550 align:middle line:90%
the security for Sandia Labs.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And all the underground
facilities under there

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.250 align:middle line:84%
are all rented out by
major corporations.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Each level is actually rented
out by different corporations

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:84%
for different things for
biological testing and things

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And also, there are portals.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.470 align:middle line:90%
The portals are real.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.790 align:middle line:90%
There are man-made portals.

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There are portals that
have been on the Earth

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and under the oceans
since the earth has

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
been here, that the
extraterrestrials are using.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're monitoring these
sites in these underwater--

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.290 align:middle line:84%
where these portals are
underwater and just kind

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of figuring out, what
is going on here?

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's new.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we do have
the ability to space travel.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.310 align:middle line:84%
We do have the ability to go
to all these planets and Mars

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.980 align:middle line:90%
without rocket fuel.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are places, of
course, on Mars and the moon.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that Mars
can become habitable

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.630 align:middle line:90%
at some point in time.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
another big cover-up.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But the best part is seeing
life and bringing back

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.740 align:middle line:84%
specimens and things that
can actually help us,

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.050 align:middle line:84%
help get us to the right
voltage of our body,

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:84%
so our body can actually
do what it's meant to do.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Because like our colleagues
have pointed out,

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.250 align:middle line:90%
we are dumbed down.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And we can do amazing things.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials look
down as us as the superheroes,

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.110 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, that
we can go through so much

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:90%
and be so resilient.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And we keep going, because
we want to know the truth.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.131 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Our next panelist--

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:06.775 align:middle line:90%
Lisa Garr.

00:50:06.775 --> 00:50:08.170 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa, who do you most
admire in your field and why?

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.100 align:middle line:84%
He is no longer
physically on this planet,

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but it is Wayne Dyer.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because I believe

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that because of the enormous
amount of consciousness

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that he held when he
was here on this planet

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and because of the amount of
people's lives that he touched,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that that tethers his
consciousness still

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:47.150 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and allows us
to learn, ask questions, tether

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:90%
to his level of consciousness.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.730 align:middle line:10%
I have personally experienced
that and because I

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:10%
was a friend of his.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.850 align:middle line:10%
And I asked, where are you?

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.870 align:middle line:10%
And the images that I got were
beyond this world, nothing

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:05.000 align:middle line:10%
that I could ever have--

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.610 align:middle line:10%
I've ever seen or
experienced more vast

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.010 align:middle line:10%
than the world could ever hold.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:10%
And so my honoring of the Wayne
consciousness, so to speak--

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:25.910 align:middle line:10%
as he's collectively combined
with the God consciousness,

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:10%
I find his consciousness
to be a great being.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's no longer limited to
the human being that was Wayne.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's now the expansive
consciousness of divinity

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and all of us combined.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Lisa.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.072 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:47.072 --> 00:51:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.080 align:middle line:84%
By the way, at 8 o'clock
in the La Jolla room,

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.230 align:middle line:84%
we will have our speakers
meet-and-greet reception.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll be awarding
four special people--

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Conscious Lifetime
Achievement Awards.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.310 align:middle line:90%
So come on by.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Make sure you're there.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Next up, Dannion Brinkley.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.715 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:05.715 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Dannion, describe your
most life-changing moment.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.550 align:middle line:90%
When I met you, Tommy.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the most life
changing moment for me

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:27.320 align:middle line:90%
was being struck by lightning.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Twice.

00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I didn't get
it the first time.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.676 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:31.676 --> 00:52:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.133 align:middle line:10%
>> If you have a
spiritual connection,

00:52:35.133 --> 00:52:37.175 align:middle line:10%
remember that spiritual
connection has to do with

00:52:37.175 --> 00:52:38.702 align:middle line:10%
a sense of humor.

00:52:38.702 --> 00:52:40.160 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a sense of humor,

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
you will never define
divinity within you, OK?

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.240 align:middle line:90%
So for me, you'll never find it.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So for me, one day I grew up
as a complete jackass, 100%

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:56.330 align:middle line:84%
total tough guy, sports,
how I dealt with everything

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:90%
as I hit it in the face.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw what it did
after I hit it in the face.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.753 align:middle line:84%
And if I needed to hit
it in the face again,

00:53:02.753 --> 00:53:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I hit it in the face again.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Then I discovered,
based on having

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
being struck by lightning,
declared dead for 28 minutes,

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.010 align:middle line:84%
completely paralyzed
for six days,

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:16.010 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed for
seven months, and two years

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.122 align:middle line:84%
to learn to walk
and feed myself.

00:53:18.122 --> 00:53:19.580 align:middle line:84%
In the course of
that, I discovered

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I was hitting
myself in the face.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I think the most life
changing event is this.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:26.570 align:middle line:84%
When you leave this
world, you will

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.585 align:middle line:90%
have a panoramic life of you.

00:53:28.585 --> 00:53:30.460 align:middle line:84%
You will see your entire
life pass before you

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.660 align:middle line:90%
in a 360-degree panorama.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.390 align:middle line:90%
You will have missed nothing.

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You will watch yourself from
a second person point of view

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.350 align:middle line:84%
as if you were your
own best friend,

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.800 align:middle line:84%
so you could see how
really funny you are.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.482 align:middle line:84%
And then you will literally
become every person

00:53:46.482 --> 00:53:47.690 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever encountered.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the direct results
of your interaction between you

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and every person you've
ever encountered.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And that means it's a
fair and just universe.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it means that the
universe is in balance.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And it also means you will
get away with nothing.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:06.700 align:middle line:84%
When you realize at that point
that you're a spiritual being--

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is trying to
figure out when we got here.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And what's the reason
for being here?

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:10%
We just need to figure out
when we entered the timeline.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:84%
When did I enter the timeline
into this dimensional reality?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
all that other.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't care about what's next.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:90%
When did I enter this timeline?

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So the greatest point
is realize that--

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep going, Dannion.

00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --I am a spiritual
being like you are.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Never try to separate yourself
from the divinity that's you.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And please pay attention
to your breath,

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.320 align:middle line:90%
the greatest power you have.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And thank the divine
that it's anatomic.

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay
attention to your breath.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It controls everything
physical about you.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And the tension and the stress
that we are created and dummied

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:57.290 align:middle line:84%
down and held in a
prison psychology

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.960 align:middle line:84%
keeps us from
taking deep breaths

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and appreciating that every
breath that we breathe--

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.380 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to make
changing and making difference

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.610 align:middle line:90%
in the lives of the people.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
sincerely thank Gaia.

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I like Gaia for stepping up
to the plate and you guys

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.420 align:middle line:84%
in [INAUDIBLE]---- you guys coming
to the plate and creating this

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:84%
opportunity, so the whole
world gets the chance.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And then please, guys.

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't gotten
your Gaia membership,

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can be able to
stream this into your homes

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and to your friends.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Please take the
time to go to Gaia

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and sign up, because I
am sincerely thankful

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and to George and Tommy
for being who they are

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and creating this atmosphere.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
rewarding and exciting.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Dannion Brinkley.

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:45.080 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> He is one of
a kind, isn't he?

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I am just like you!

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:56.753 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:56.753 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you turn to me
when you said dummied down,

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.130 align:middle line:90%
by the way?

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:09.343 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:09.343 --> 00:56:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you let people
get away with stuff, George.

00:56:16.094 --> 00:56:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-oh.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> What you do, George--

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you going to go there?

00:56:21.148 --> 00:56:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:27.380 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you let
people get away with stuff.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.980 align:middle line:84%
You let people get away with
stuff when you don't have to.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But the kindness and
caring about you--

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:84%
you allow people to make
fools of themselves.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Like I'm doing now.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm appreciative of that.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So I allow and thankful
for you to allow them

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to be just the way, they are.

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.415 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:51.415 --> 00:56:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next panelist--
rabbi, join the podium.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.670 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:02.015 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.015 --> 00:57:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, Tommy.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Rabbi [INAUDIBLE],, what is
your greatest accomplishment

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.430 align:middle line:90%
and why?

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Boy, you throw the
curveballs at him.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he gives me
the easy questions here.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.815 align:middle line:84%
To answer your
question honestly,

00:57:15.815 --> 00:57:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
accomplishments.

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything
that I consider.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.560 align:middle line:10%
It's not anything I
concern myself with.

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.260 align:middle line:10%
I don't live for the
sake of accomplishments.

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:28.440 align:middle line:10%
What we do in our
tradition is to serve.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:32.510 align:middle line:10%
We learn to experience and
practice greater realities.

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:34.010 align:middle line:10%
And part of that
greater reality is

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:35.930 align:middle line:10%
to recognize there
is no individuality.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:37.790 align:middle line:10%
We're all part of
a greater whole.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:10%
It is something that we call in
the Hebrew, [SPEAKING HEBREW],,

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.640 align:middle line:10%
which means nullification of
self through the recognition

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.148 align:middle line:10%
of something greater.

00:57:45.148 --> 00:57:47.690 align:middle line:10%
So essentially as many of the
panelists have been discussing,

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:10%
their experiences with a greater
and greater consciousness,

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.360 align:middle line:10%
a greater concept of unity--

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.460 align:middle line:10%
that is what we
seek to accomplish.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.240 align:middle line:10%
That is what we
seek to experience.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And as such, accomplishment
is a foreign concept.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.700 align:middle line:10%
This is something
that an individual

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.260 align:middle line:10%
seeks for one's self.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.850 align:middle line:10%
But when one
recognizes that there's

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:11.270 align:middle line:10%
only one great true
reality, then that sense

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:14.660 align:middle line:10%
of individuality or
individual accomplishment

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.190 align:middle line:10%
doesn't really mean
much of anything at all.

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:19.880 align:middle line:10%
So essentially, to
answer your question,

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.970 align:middle line:10%
your question is
meaningless to me.

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.960 align:middle line:90%
it's not a value.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not about me.

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not even about us.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about a recognition
of a greater whole.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And as that, we
all are servants.

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You threw the easy question,
if you remember the last time,

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.740 align:middle line:90%
about what I did as a kid.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.450 align:middle line:10%
And I thought about that as
I was sitting here, right?

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:42.860 align:middle line:10%
Toys.

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know something?

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:10%
If you look back at what
we do when we were young

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.520 align:middle line:10%
Remembered the words
of a Jewish rabbi

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.860 align:middle line:10%
named Paul when I was a child.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.120 align:middle line:10%
I did childish things.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And when I became an adult, I
put childish ways behind me.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.500 align:middle line:10%
It's from the Christian Bible.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.020 align:middle line:10%
But remember, it's
written by a Jewish rabbi.

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:03.290 align:middle line:10%
In that respect, we all
should be looking back

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.860 align:middle line:10%
at the things we
did in our past.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Because they're foreshadows
of where we are today

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.085 align:middle line:10%
and where we need
to go in the future.

00:59:09.085 --> 00:59:12.650 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, we will
recognize that ultimate goal.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Like we say in Hebrew,
[SPEAKING HEBREW],,

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:19.310 align:middle line:10%
which means God is one.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:20.550 align:middle line:10%
We are one.

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:23.800 align:middle line:10%
And we can recognize that
ultimate sense of reality

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:10%
than the pursuits of
our individualities.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.050 align:middle line:10%
And our individual
accomplishments

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.617 align:middle line:10%
becomes secondary to
the greater needs.

00:59:33.617 --> 00:59:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, rabbi.

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:35.821 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:35.821 --> 00:59:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Grant Cameron-- back up.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.991 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:42.991 --> 00:59:45.773 align:middle line:90%


00:59:45.773 --> 00:59:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Grant, what's the most
difficult thing you've had

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to give up in life?

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.020 align:middle line:90%


00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Most difficult
thing to give up?

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't even think.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.190 align:middle line:10%
>> He hasn't given
anything up yet.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sort of a--

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm a minimalist, so I
really don't have anything.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.070 align:middle line:10%
So I really don't have
any value except for

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.320 align:middle line:10%
my little [INAUDIBLE] machine.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This is my one
possession I have.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.676 align:middle line:90%


01:00:16.676 --> 01:00:19.000 align:middle line:10%
And my father-- I guess
when my father died,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.190 align:middle line:10%
I was there with
him when he died.

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.840 align:middle line:10%
Things like that--
the personal elements.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
material things, I

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.350 align:middle line:84%
don't think there's many
people who have less.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really have
no value in anything.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
made me that way.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:39.160 align:middle line:10%
But the personal
elements, the breakup

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.090 align:middle line:10%
of my marriage, which I took
some responsibility for,

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.070 align:middle line:10%
apologizing to my son
for what had happened.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.407 align:middle line:84%
It's those kind of things
that you look back on.

01:00:49.407 --> 01:00:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We talked about the life review.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big
Michael Newton fan.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.570 align:middle line:10%
And Michael Newton talks about
that as well-- the life review,

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.737 align:middle line:10%
that basically you only
have one thing in your life,

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
is that you come in here.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
If reincarnation is a fact, you
come in here to do something.

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:06.270 align:middle line:10%
And when you walk out, you
only get asked one question.

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.270 align:middle line:10%
And how did it work out?

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.437 align:middle line:10%
And you get the life review.

01:01:08.437 --> 01:01:09.942 align:middle line:10%
You don't get away
with anything.

01:01:09.942 --> 01:01:12.400 align:middle line:10%
And basically, you can't bring
up Hillary Clinton's emails,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.500 align:middle line:10%
or Donald Trump, or
your mother-in-law,

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.820 align:middle line:10%
or the dog ate my homework.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It's basically all about you.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
call timeout if you

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
try to bring in somebody else.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
things I think about.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there
will be a life review.

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.920 align:middle line:10%
And the things that
I regret the most

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.380 align:middle line:10%
are in terms of personal
things and things

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:33.010 align:middle line:10%
that I realized I did to other
people that at some point,

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to have
to feel their pain.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Grant Cameron.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.327 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:41.310 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:44.510 align:middle line:84%
As we move around on our
second group of panelists,

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Sonja Grace.

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Sonja?

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:47.295 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:51.570 align:middle line:90%


01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Sonja, describe your idea
of hell and then describe

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:56.410 align:middle line:90%
your idea of heaven.

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:58.390 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, really, let's
talk about duality,

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
part of duality.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
We have been submerged
in duality forever.

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're now coming to the
end of this phase of humanity

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and duality.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We're watching it
literally split apart.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
We're in the fifth dimension.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.060 align:middle line:90%
This vibration is very high.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And this whole notion of
measuring things outside

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.130 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves--

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
this is right, this is
wrong, this is good,

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
this is bad is what
we've done for centuries.

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Our energy leaves our body,
and it jumps into something.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.340 align:middle line:90%
That's so bad.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
And our energy is engaged in it.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
creating more karma.

01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we just connected
with the collective karma.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And the karma wheel
starts turning again,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.580 align:middle line:90%
because we are in dualism.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's only until
we figure that out

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and that we understand
that we don't have

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to participate in duality--

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
heaven and hell--
these concepts--

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that we step back into our
ourselves into our inner peace.

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.670 align:middle line:90%
That's yours.

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You guys have inner
peace inside of you.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:30.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not a John Lennon song, OK?

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It was good back then,
but it's inside of us.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we go into that
state of inner peace,

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
then we have the
ability to observe

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
what is right and wrong,
what is good and bad,

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and no longer engage our
energy in that and measure

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.760 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can go inside
and measure things

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.080 align:middle line:90%
inside our soul body.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
ability to really

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
be in a state of inner peace.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Heaven is a place where we go.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wrap it up.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't hear that bell.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Wrap it up.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.223 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the bell, Sonja.

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Heaven is a place that we
go that's the spirit realm.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And hell is what we
create here on Earth.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Hell is a state of mind.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's being unhappy
and depressed.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
Phoenix, Arizona.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Phoenix.

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It just gets really hot there.

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.401 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%


01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So I leave you,
Tommy, on these words.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is when we really
can understand duality,

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we will get it straight on
the heaven and hell front.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.000 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.912 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I don't need a bell
when I'm doing "Coast to Coast."

01:04:53.912 --> 01:04:54.995 align:middle line:90%
I just go to a commercial.

01:04:54.995 --> 01:04:56.224 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:57.140 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Billy Carson.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.410 align:middle line:90%


01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Billy, describe what you're
spending your last day on Earth

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.880 align:middle line:90%
with your parents would be like.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Spending the
last day on Earth?

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I'm spending the last
day on Earth with my parents,

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we must be getting ready
to leave this planet

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and go to another planet.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
That would be my ultimate
goal, ultimate dream.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
we would be doing

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
would be having some
very deep discussions as

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
to our lives here, what
we've accomplished,

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
how many people did we help?

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
What have our ancestors--
did on this planet?

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Which some of my
ancestors have done a lot

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to help people on this
planet a very long time ago.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And we would be talking
about just kind of--

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe probably reminiscing
on the things that we've done.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we are moving
on to another place,

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
how we will progress
to that new place

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and how we will continue
to assist and service

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.540 align:middle line:90%
people, or entities, or beings.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
How can we be champions
for the greater good?

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably what
we would be talking about.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:19.188 align:middle line:84%
I remember 2010 when
my mom passed away,

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the
room with her talking.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
She unfortunately
came down with ALS.

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And she was very, very
weak, very, very sick.

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I really
wish I had at that moment

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
was a voice recorder
as she was telling me

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of very private
and sacred information.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I would love to have
recorded that and then taken

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
that voice file.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any tattoos,
but that would probably

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
be the only tattoo that I
would have gotten on my body

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:50.251 align:middle line:84%
would be the voice imprint of
the last words of my mother.

01:06:50.251 --> 01:06:51.664 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:52.606 align:middle line:90%


01:06:52.606 --> 01:06:53.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Billy.

01:06:53.548 --> 01:06:56.850 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Linda had to depart.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
She says thank you.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
She's got a prior, so
she has left the panel.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.578 align:middle line:90%
Paola Harris.

01:07:04.578 --> 01:07:06.015 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:06.015 --> 01:07:09.290 align:middle line:90%


01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola, act like you're
talking to your daughter who is

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
going on a very important
interview and give her some

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.240 align:middle line:90%
advice.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I do have a daughter.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.250 align:middle line:90%


01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And her name is Lisa Marie,
because I was an Elvis groupie.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.865 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:27.865 --> 01:07:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you very much.

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>> But anyway, the
thing about Lisa--

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.840 align:middle line:10%
and I have to be honest
with the audience.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.930 align:middle line:10%
She's wiser than I am.

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.820 align:middle line:10%
No, it's genetic.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:40.630 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:47.120 align:middle line:10%
And she's the one that plays
the mother in our family.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.450 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't really appreciate
my talking about UFOs,

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.870 align:middle line:10%
because my family is
not really into it.

01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Really?

01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:57.470 --> 01:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
She has never seen a video
I've been in or read my books.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.810 align:middle line:10%
But she's a very,
very lovely child.

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.310 align:middle line:10%
That is the greatest
accomplishment.

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.040 align:middle line:10%
And she will say
to me have fun mom

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.460 align:middle line:10%
and support me unconditionally.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she
did when I came here.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.689 align:middle line:90%
Have fun, mom.

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We support you unconditionally,
not knowing anything I do.

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
This is 40 years
worth of this work.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:29.830 align:middle line:10%
So I could only do for her
what she's done for me,

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:32.920 align:middle line:10%
just support her
unconditionally and tell her

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.859 align:middle line:10%
how amazing she is.

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need to
do that with all our children.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.350 align:middle line:10%
Because every word
that comes out

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.350 align:middle line:10%
of their mouth with our kids--

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:47.319 align:middle line:10%
it really, really
resonates with them.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:50.899 align:middle line:10%
And the negativity--
they never forget.

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:53.500 align:middle line:10%
So I've learned that in
my lifetime being a mother

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.930 align:middle line:10%
that you better
watch what you say.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.290 align:middle line:10%
They never forget it.

01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:02.470 align:middle line:10%
So my advice, Tom,
would be you're amazing.

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.750 align:middle line:10%
Whatever happens is
destiny, and you're

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.731 align:middle line:10%
going to do an amazing job.

01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:08.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Paola.

01:09:08.705 --> 01:09:10.166 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:13.100 align:middle line:90%


01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been blessed with three
children, six grandchildren.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And my oldest--
she's 25 years old--

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
sends me a text a couple
days ago of an ultrasound.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.205 align:middle line:84%
And she said, papa, you're
going to be a great grandfather.

01:09:28.205 --> 01:09:29.562 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:29.562 --> 01:09:32.689 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.319 align:middle line:90%
At 29.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:39.824 align:middle line:84%
Next up, the Rocket
Man, David Adair.

01:09:39.824 --> 01:09:41.306 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:44.279 align:middle line:90%


01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> David, if you were given
unlimited musical talent

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.585 align:middle line:84%
in this life, what instrument
would you choose to play

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:50.385 align:middle line:90%
and why?

01:09:50.385 --> 01:09:53.370 align:middle line:90%


01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be a synthesizer,
because of the range on it.

01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:02.866 align:middle line:84%
And because I knew how
to play one when I was--

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.035 align:middle line:90%
an experiment I had done.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%
An amazing thing I saw.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I melted metal in a
weightless environment.

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I built a machine where
I could shape the metal.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
for every shape

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
in the geometric
universe, whether it's

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
a square, a triangle,
circle, there's

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
a corresponding sound for it.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:30.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, with audiences like this,
you all go, oh, of course.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Most people in the world don't
even know that kind of stuff.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:40.110 align:middle line:10%
And in that corresponding,
there is a frequency.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:43.410 align:middle line:10%
And more importantly,
there is a formula

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:47.700 align:middle line:10%
that you can use to figure
out the vibration waves.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:52.860 align:middle line:10%
And so what I did was I was able
to build a six-sided speaker

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.430 align:middle line:10%
box, have it on the
inside cargo bay

01:10:56.430 --> 01:11:00.218 align:middle line:10%
of a space shuttle inside a
55-gallon drum-looking thing.

01:11:00.218 --> 01:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And the astronauts-- all we had
to do was just flip a switch,

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.030 align:middle line:90%
once on and once off.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was called GAS--

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.100 align:middle line:10%
G-A-S-- Giveaway Special.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's like something
from an airline.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But I ran this
operation up there.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And I used stereo sound
waves to shape metal

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.870 align:middle line:10%
in a three-dimensional form.

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And you had to see
what would happen.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.866 align:middle line:90%
>> In a vacuum?

01:11:24.866 --> 01:11:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a total vacuum.

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
But here's the deal.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
You have a glob laying there.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And you take like a bar scanner.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%

But here's the kicker.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.320 align:middle line:90%
The molecular structure inside--

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
if you look inside
anything metal that's

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.375 align:middle line:10%
exactly where I want
it when it hardens.

come back to gravity field.

end of the day,

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.930 align:middle line:84%
if there is anything
an individual can

01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
do to help at this point
is to help themself

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and to transform, to
connect with themself

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and really transcend the
limitations that they

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
may encounter in their life
and as a result of their hurt,

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
as a result of--

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
it's tremendous
coming to Earth, as

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
like most of the trauma
that happens in your life

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
happens in the first
few seconds of your life

01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:47.580 align:middle line:84%
when you encounter with
the medical profession.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%


01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And we spend a whole
bunch of our time

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
trying to overcome this.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think, overall--

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sure, developing amazing
technologies like transforming

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
the way we interact with
the biological structures

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, and giving
an opportunity for humanity

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to move its
civilization to space,

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
are really important.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But they cannot happen if we
don't change our relationship

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
to the universe internally
and realize that we are

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, one way that we can
learn about our guardian angels

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
is to really understand
who our ancestors are.

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Because our ancestors are on
the other side looking after us.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Our parents, our grandparents,
our great grandparents.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
People have all kinds
of guardian angels.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that when we pass
and we go to the other side,

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
we do have that soul contract
with our family of origin

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth that will
look after each other,

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
until usually I see about
three generations out.

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And then people start
to reincarnate again.

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So to know your
guardian angels--

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes, there is angels.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
The angelic realm is tremendous.

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
your relatives.

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, I get clients on the phone.

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say your mom
is looking after you.

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And the client will say,
I don't like my mom.

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want her
to look after me.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, I'm sorry.

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:21.990 align:middle line:90%
But that's where karma comes in.

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.870 align:middle line:90%
We have to work this stuff out.

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I hear all the
time people say,

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
well, I didn't get to talk
to dad before he passed.

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Or I didn't get to have a
conversation with their loved

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:37.920 align:middle line:90%
one before they died.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
they come to me.

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having that
conversation with the person

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
and the client.

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
profound things

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
ever was this father told his
daughter, I will contact you.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.270 align:middle line:90%
She made an appointment with me.

01:17:57.270 --> 01:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%

I'd had a review.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But he said it wasn't
about what I had done.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about all of the
things that I'd become.

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:17.250 align:middle line:90%
It was about how much I loved.

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%

was about the fact

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that I loved you, and
your mother, and our dog.

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And that was about it.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said what
I really learned

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
in my review was that I was
supposed to love everyone

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
around the world as much as
I loved you, and your mother,

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.480 align:middle line:90%

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
You would have to believe
that we are reincarnated.

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.930 align:middle line:10%
And that reincarnation is
a possibility in our life.

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.490 align:middle line:10%
I listened to some of this.

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:10.562 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe in
so much about karma.

01:20:10.562 --> 01:20:12.770 align:middle line:10%
You've got to keep coming
back till you get it right,

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:15.167 align:middle line:10%
because when you
listen to that process,

01:20:15.167 --> 01:20:17.000 align:middle line:10%
the greatest thing
you're going to get to be

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.770 align:middle line:10%
is a starving cow in India.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.246 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:20.246 --> 01:20:21.230 align:middle line:90%


01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not so much karma
driven as being reincarnated,

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
keep getting it right

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.580 align:middle line:84%
or I got to keep coming
till I get it right.

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:35.720 align:middle line:10%
If I'm karma reincarnated so
I can come and keep doing good

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.990 align:middle line:10%
and to keep fulfilling the
points, hell, everybody,

01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:42.380 align:middle line:10%
I've been reincarnated six
times just in this life.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.060 align:middle line:10%
So I can imagine what is
life in all these others.

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.990 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that
reincarnation is

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.960 align:middle line:10%
a highly probable
plausibility based

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.910 align:middle line:10%
on the realms of
consciousness of

01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:56.000 align:middle line:10%
dimensional and
interdimensional reality

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.640 align:middle line:10%
that we occupy
and spend time in.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So reincarnation is not all
that stuff about being punished.

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.200 align:middle line:10%
You got to come till
you get it right,

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.360 align:middle line:10%
or till your momma likes you,
or whatever all people do.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.210 align:middle line:10%
But I believe we
have multiple lives

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:14.090 align:middle line:10%
and multiple opportunities
in multiple places,

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:17.900 align:middle line:10%
because we are multiple,
spiritual, connected beings.

a selfless act that you've done

in the last 24 hours.

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

Wow.

01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do any, not
that I can think of.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.460 align:middle line:90%


01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Selfless.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.060 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done any.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the way--

01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I try to live my life that
way that I live of service.

01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of volunteer.

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:06.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what I basically do.

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:08.420 align:middle line:90%
That and research.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:14.270 align:middle line:10%
But in terms of the
last 24 hours, actually,

01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:19.467 align:middle line:10%
I cannot think of
anything that I've done.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let's get you
off the hot seat.

01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:22.332 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you another one.

01:22:22.332 --> 01:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
What is the best advice
you have ever received?

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:27.470 align:middle line:90%


01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> The best advice?

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The best knowledge
to me is always

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be Dr. Michael
Newton, having seen

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.497 align:middle line:90%
him lecture and the philosophy.

01:22:37.497 --> 01:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I had three big
enlightenment moments.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.500 align:middle line:90%
One was the UFO sighting I saw.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The second was the
download experience.

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
The third was seeing Dr.
Michael Newton lecture,

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
which absolutely changed
my life-- the whole concept

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.190 align:middle line:90%
of, oh, that's how it works.

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it just totally
made sense to me.

01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
the big thing for me

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:58.070 align:middle line:90%
is the spiritual teachers.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Wayne Dyer was mentioned.

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Deepak Chopra.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people like
this that I just like.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I could listen to them
like 24 hours a day.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Grant Cameron.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, we just
lost last week a dear guest

01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
to the program and a real
supporter of everything we do--

01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Marshall Klarfeld, who
is no longer with us.

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:26.098 align:middle line:90%
Paola Harris, you're next.

01:23:26.098 --> 01:23:27.505 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:27.505 --> 01:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%


01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola, in your opinion,
what's the one thing that

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:36.850 align:middle line:84%
stands in the way of
people's happiness?

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Not being in the present.

01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I just learned this
in my 70-plus years.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking at the future
of only planning the future.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at the past.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was just walking in a
beautiful park in San Francisco

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
last week.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all these people
on their cell phones.

01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was birds of paradise
and flowers everywhere.

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And there I could see San
Francisco Bay, and the Bay

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Bridge.

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and stopped,
and quieted my mind,

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.260 align:middle line:90%
and said enjoy this.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.440 align:middle line:90%
This is all there is.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, what
if tomorrow an asteroid

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:18.250 align:middle line:90%
hit the Earth?

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
all these plans.

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And you're worried about money.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And you're worried about this,
and you're worried about that.

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:30.070 align:middle line:10%
This moment right now
where you're breathing

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.320 align:middle line:10%
is all there is.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:39.408 align:middle line:10%
And we should enjoy every single
minute of being in the present.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:40.905 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:40.905 --> 01:24:41.903 align:middle line:90%
>> So true.

01:24:41.903 --> 01:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%


01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:46.010 align:middle line:10%
Rabbi, you're up next.

01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%


01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Rabbi.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
describe for us what

01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
you think it will be like in
100 years from now on Earth.

01:24:57.410 --> 01:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that all depends
on us now, doesn't it?

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
potentials in that respect.

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I know many people, especially
from religious points of view,

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we're waiting for some
supernatural intervention

01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
from some divine and/or
extraterrestrial source.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
That the aliens are
going to come and save us

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
or a Messiah is going
to come and save us.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Why do we think such things?

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
the history, we're

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
going to be here in another
hundred years, most likely

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
not that different from
how we are right now.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But that again
all depends on us.

01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
We have an entire
century ahead of us.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of very
significant, serious problems

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.920 align:middle line:90%
going on in our world today.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.920 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of divisions
and all kinds of problems

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to destroy ourselves in ways
that we've never had before.

01:25:42.630 --> 01:25:45.357 align:middle line:84%
We're either going to overcome
it or a hundred years from now,

01:25:45.357 --> 01:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
living back in what?

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.080 align:middle line:90%
The Stone Age kind of thing?

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, the
choice is ours.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
one of the greatest--

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll use a strong word--

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.070 align:middle line:90%
deception.

01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
That people are actually
waiting for some type

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of supernatural intervention
from the skies or somehow.

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We sit back and say,
we're waiting for God.

01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you could
say, it's God, I think,

01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
who's sitting back
and waiting for us.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And part of our
Kabbalistic Torah teachings

01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:21.208 align:middle line:84%
is that if anyone truly wants
to wait and bring a Messiah,

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
look with inside
yourselves, because that's

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where the Messiah is
going to come from.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately and essentially,
like the whole message

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.763 align:middle line:84%
of everything that we teach
in our school is, again,

01:26:31.763 --> 01:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
bringing people together,
building the bridges

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and all the like.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.328 align:middle line:84%
So in a hundred years
from now, no, I'm

01:26:38.328 --> 01:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
not going to tell you what
it's going to be like.

01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I would never want to predict
what it's going to be like.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.742 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not going
to collapse a singularity

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and try to foretell and predict.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's leave it open.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And give us the choice
and the opportunity

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:51.317 align:middle line:90%
to make the right decisions.

01:26:51.317 --> 01:26:52.623 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:52.623 --> 01:26:58.520 align:middle line:90%


01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Do they call in--

01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:03.190 align:middle line:10%
when you're in
your synagogue, did

01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:05.960 align:middle line:10%

it's called sermons.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.100 align:middle line:90%

01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Tommy.

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:44.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Lisa, how do you want
people to perceive you?

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And do you think they do
perceive you like that now?

01:27:46.530 --> 01:27:50.010 align:middle line:90%


01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:55.350 align:middle line:10%
>> I've always taught my
daughter that others will see

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:57.930 align:middle line:10%
you the way you see yourself.

01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And what that does
is it takes your--

01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:02.520 align:middle line:10%
and turns your
internal reflection

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.080 align:middle line:10%
into how you show
up in the world,

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.410 align:middle line:10%
based on what your
internal practice is.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:13.860 align:middle line:10%
And so how others see me--

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.890 align:middle line:10%
if I spent time
on that, it would

01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.260 align:middle line:10%
be kind of a waste of time.

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:23.730 align:middle line:10%
What I spend time on
is, how do I feel?

01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:27.690 align:middle line:10%
And how am I of service
and showing up of service

01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:28.560 align:middle line:10%
to the world?

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.340 align:middle line:10%
How am I serving my
purpose on this planet?

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And how do I show up in
doing that in the world?

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.380 align:middle line:10%
How am I serving others?

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:42.510 align:middle line:10%
And in that journey of--

01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:43.670 align:middle line:10%
it's not even self-worth.

01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:45.870 align:middle line:10%
It's just self-love.

01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Then others perceive
and hopefully

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.930 align:middle line:10%
mirror that, or
share that, or go

01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:53.700 align:middle line:10%
on that journey along with me.

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.130 align:middle line:10%
The more open I am, the more
open someone else will be.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:59.190 align:middle line:10%
The more curious I am, the more
curious someone else will be.

01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
The more loving I am, the more
it gives permission to others

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.440 align:middle line:10%
to do the same.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.860 align:middle line:10%
So it doesn't concern me--
how others think of me.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.500 align:middle line:10%
That would be a waste of time.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.320 align:middle line:10%
It concerns me how I'm showing
up and serving my purpose,

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and God's purpose, and
God's will in this world

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.830 align:middle line:10%
that matters of just how I
impact others and give them

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:26.220 align:middle line:10%
permission to be who they are
as I give myself permission

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.390 align:middle line:10%

And I saw someone who
was speaking about that

01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:04.260 align:middle line:10%
and saying we come
here and we write.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.385 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to write
our epitaphs, what that be.

01:30:06.385 --> 01:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And after the lecture,
someone was on the ground

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and really crying,
having a hard time.

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And he realized
that nobody would

01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.620 align:middle line:84%
say anything nice about him,
because he'd been really harsh

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.100 align:middle line:90%
his whole life.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was an opening
for him to see that

01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and to really truly reflect.

01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:29.105 align:middle line:84%
And it actually changed
his life to realize

01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that if somebody were to
write something about him,

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:34.350 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have
been a good thing.

01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:36.750 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's a great
exercise for all of us

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.810 align:middle line:10%
to do is to write our own
epitaph, to see how we would

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:42.490 align:middle line:10%
show up in the world and
what other people would

01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:43.290 align:middle line:10%
say about us.

01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.972 align:middle line:90%

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.190 align:middle line:90%
The one goal in life.

01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I have trouble reaching?

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.320 align:middle line:90%
There's so many things.

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Myself being an entrepreneur, I
said a lot of goals for myself

01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:21.590 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you are an
entrepreneur or somebody who

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
sets a lot of goals, you find
that for every five things

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that you start, you're lucky
if one really takes off or does

01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
anything really at all.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.940 align:middle line:90%
So it can be tough.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you take that
and extrapolate it

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to your own lives, you
start to realize that we all

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
have goals, wishes, and
dreams, and things that we

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.890 align:middle line:90%
want to achieve and accomplish.

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
set very, very lofty

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and big goals, at least I do.

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to fall short
on them from time to time.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that probably one of the
biggest goals that I would've

01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
liked to have reached would
be to sustain a whole family

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.760 align:middle line:90%
from start to finish.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.148 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, I have.

01:34:15.148 --> 01:34:16.190 align:middle line:90%
I've been married before.

01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And I have been divorced.

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
goals or one of the things

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that I always thought--
it was that I would have

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the house that had
the big Thanksgiving

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:28.700 align:middle line:84%
dinners or the
holiday situations

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.488 align:middle line:84%
where all the family would come
down, and so forth, and so on.

01:34:31.488 --> 01:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And it just didn't
work out that way.

01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:34.762 align:middle line:90%
And I tried a few times.

01:34:34.762 --> 01:34:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, this time it
will work out that way.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's been a very
big goal in my life,

01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
just because I
felt from the time

01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was a young child
growing up in a very, very poor

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and kind of broken situation
that I would try to do better.

01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to
achieve something

01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have a chance
to really experience myself

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.680 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I was loved, but it was a very
broken and very poor situation.

01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be able to
establish something that

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
would be set for
prosperity and would

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.300 align:middle line:90%
last for a very long time.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So that would be one of
the goals I would probably

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.050 align:middle line:90%
say that I fell short on.

01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:16.130 align:middle line:90%
But I keep trying.

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And I keep trying to persevere.

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I haven't given up on those
type of goals and dreams.

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
important things is

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:28.730 align:middle line:84%
If you try something and you
fail, don't say that you lost.

01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Just try to say
that you learned.

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at the situation and
look at what happened.

01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Try to pick it apart.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And try to figure
out what you could

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
have done yourself to help the
situation, make things better.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Or what did you learn from it?

01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think now, to be
quite honest with you,

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.923 align:middle line:84%
I'm at a point in my
life where I've just

01:35:46.923 --> 01:35:48.590 align:middle line:84%
realized that a lot
of the things that I

01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
went through relationship
wise in the past--

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and don't get me wrong.

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I had a very, very
nice family life.

01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You have five kids
and two grandchildren.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But looking back,
it's like I've learned

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.380 align:middle line:84%
things about having
patience, being

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.740 align:middle line:90%
able to be more compassionate.

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Spending more time is very,
very important quality time.

01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I was a workaholic.

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I would sleep literally
four hours a day.

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would work my butt
off every single day,

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.340 align:middle line:90%
7 days a week.

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Little things like that.

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to also learn you
develop things like patience,

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and how to talk to
people the right way, how

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
to address your spouse or your
better half in a better way,

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and to deal with situations.

01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I found now, at
this point in my life

01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that I've matured to a
specific level, a certain level

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that I've never actually
experienced before.

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
now, I feel like I'm

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
fully empowered and ready
to take on that goal

01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:54.440 align:middle line:84%
again and succeed with it,
just based off of my life

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
experiences and
being able to learn

01:36:57.230 --> 01:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and really take it in, analyze
it, break it down, and then try

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to utilize new solutions and
new ways of dealing with things

01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really excited
for the future.

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being down and
downtrodden about not achieving

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that goal initially,
I'm looking forward

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to trying to accomplish
it now and have

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.048 align:middle line:90%
a very successful future.

01:37:18.048 --> 01:37:19.392 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGS]

01:37:19.392 --> 01:37:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Billy.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Two more panelists.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.083 align:middle line:90%
Next stop, Emery Smith.

01:37:25.083 --> 01:37:26.556 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:26.556 --> 01:37:32.940 align:middle line:90%


01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Emery, what's the one thing
that if you weren't scared

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:38.090 align:middle line:90%
of, you would do?

01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> This guy has no fear, Tom.

01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:37:40.930 --> 01:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
going to go anywhere.

01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You want a different question?

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.140 align:middle line:90%


01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.775 align:middle line:84%
>> He eats nails
for breakfast, Tom.

01:37:54.775 --> 01:37:55.575 align:middle line:90%
They're organic.

01:37:55.575 --> 01:37:56.752 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:56.752 --> 01:37:58.050 align:middle line:90%


01:37:58.050 --> 01:37:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:37:58.850 --> 01:38:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you want your
life to be like in five years.

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.096 align:middle line:90%


01:38:05.096 --> 01:38:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I want--

01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
my life is everyone's
life, I consider.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I see the world changing
in beautiful ways

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
with new technologies and
a new train of thought

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and great exploration
on our Earth

01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to recover things to set the
record straight of what's

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.530 align:middle line:90%
really happening.

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So I look forward and see
my life in the future,

01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
helping corporations
and organizations build

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.380 align:middle line:84%
huge self-sustainable
communities, to get off

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.600 align:middle line:84%
gas, coal, and oil,
and pharmaceuticals

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and reducing surgery
by at least 80%.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I see a beautiful
utopia that can

01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:57.090 align:middle line:84%
be produced all
around the world,

01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:59.600 align:middle line:84%
not just here in
the United States.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And being part of that and
bringing everyone with me--

01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and all of you and
everyone can be

01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:14.810 align:middle line:84%
part of this new world, this
new fantastic civilization

01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:18.630 align:middle line:90%
that we are working towards.

01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I see myself
as assisting scientists

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and corporations figuring
out these problems

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:33.110 align:middle line:84%
through the civilian
world and helping

01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:38.390 align:middle line:90%
them expedite this vision.

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, allowing the
political governments

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations to
be involved with this.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all about
working together, not

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.210 align:middle line:90%
going up against something.

01:39:53.210 --> 01:39:55.010 align:middle line:84%
There's millions of
scientists out there

01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
who have done many
brilliant things

01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and have made similar
devices as mine.

01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They just don't want to come
up on the podium like I would

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and talk about it.

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think the more that we talk
about these things, the more

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.190 align:middle line:84%
information and the
more materials that'll

01:40:16.190 --> 01:40:19.910 align:middle line:84%
be out there to help
us get to this utopia.

01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very simple thing.

01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:23.570 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we all
start thinking that way

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting it,
it's what I see.

01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And I know it will happen.

01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Because when I-- whatever I
dream of and whenever manifest,

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it always happens,
except for the part

01:40:39.170 --> 01:40:41.030 align:middle line:90%
when they try to kill me.

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But besides that, if we
all have this positivity

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and this manifestation
thought process, all of us

01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and everyone listening
around the world right now--

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.500 align:middle line:90%
it will happen.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen, and
it's just a matter of time.

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:59.580 align:middle line:90%
But we can expedite it.

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.035 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:01.035 --> 01:41:04.920 align:middle line:90%


01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.298 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's wrap this
up with Dave Adair.

01:41:07.298 --> 01:41:08.732 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:08.732 --> 01:41:13.040 align:middle line:90%


01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> David, other
than what you do,

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
name two things that interest
you that would surprise us

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and tell us why.

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:20.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, God.

01:41:20.462 --> 01:41:21.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:24.110 align:middle line:90%


01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I hear you over there.

01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:28.850 align:middle line:90%


01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:38.400 align:middle line:84%
One would be sculpturing,
designing of--

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.615 align:middle line:84%
chiseling away at rock and
marble or tile or clay.

01:41:43.615 --> 01:41:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Told you he
made the pyramids.

01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:46.362 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:46.362 --> 01:41:48.670 align:middle line:90%


01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing I remember of
what Michelangelo said about

01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:56.840 align:middle line:84%
the "Statue of David," that
he did not create David.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.310 align:middle line:90%
He released it from the rock.

01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:02.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's something
that I learned

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.886 align:middle line:10%
by working when I was
building [INAUDIBLE]..

01:42:04.886 --> 01:42:08.120 align:middle line:90%


01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You're like chiseling--
cold steel and a hammer

01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:12.050 align:middle line:90%
hitting that rock.

01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And every time that chisel cuts
into that rock and that rock

01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:16.010 align:middle line:90%
feels it.

01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:19.863 align:middle line:84%
But with every-- all the pain
that rock is going through,

01:42:19.863 --> 01:42:22.280 align:middle line:84%
it's also going to release the
most beautiful thing you've

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.285 align:middle line:90%
ever seen on the planet.

01:42:24.285 --> 01:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was building
[INAUDIBLE],, it was same way.

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.180 align:middle line:90%


01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like a piece
of sculpture work.

01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is a
designer of stained glass.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.947 align:middle line:90%
I like designing stained glass.

01:42:44.947 --> 01:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what you can
do to get all the colors

01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and stuff out of it.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And also, I noticed something
in the world of stained glass.

01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any images
of planets, stars, or space,

01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:56.750 align:middle line:90%
really.

01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
You see the flowers,
and the birds,
