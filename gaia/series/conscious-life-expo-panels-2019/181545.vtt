[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everybody, again.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.510 align:middle line:90%
It's time now.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.570 align:middle line:90%
We're going to start.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
introduce your host.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he's
interviewed everyone

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:84%
on the stage, who's coming on
this stage today, on his show.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
He's interviewed everyone
who was on "Ancient Aliens"

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
on his show, or on "Coast to
Coast," where he stands in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
for George Noory sometimes.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:10%
And you know him as the
host of "Fade to Black"

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
on the Game Changer Network and
various shows on the History

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:10%
Channel, as well.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's give a warm
welcome to Jimmy Church.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.847 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:47.775 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yo.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:90%
How is everybody?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the 2019
Conscious Life Expo.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.308 align:middle line:84%
And as you probably know,
we're also broadcasting

00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
all around the world right now.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:90%
How cool is that?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Give it up.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.728 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We've got a lot to do tonight.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to jump into
this as quick as I can.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:90%
But before I do, before I do--

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't, don't.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Tonight's a very,
very special evening.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:90%
It's very special.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:90%
50 years.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
50 years, "Chariots
of the Gods."

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in
this room, everybody

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
here has a "Chariots
of the Gods" story.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.105 align:middle line:90%
Everybody here.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
The first time
you read the book,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
how you got the book,
how it changed you.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like you.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I have the same story.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And for me, I was 1970.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm seven, eight years old.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
My mom-- she's not
with us anymore--

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
she's real cool, crazy
lady, says, you know,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:90%
check out this book.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Gives me a copy of "Chariots
of the Gods," right?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of years later--

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I read this, I'm seven,
eight years old--

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
and then the movie comes out.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And we all remember
that, the impact

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:90%
of that, right, the movie.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And back then, three
channels, plus some UHF.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the commercials
would come on

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and when the commercials
would come on,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I would wait, I would wait for
the commercials, and the Nazca

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:90%
lines, right, the plane.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like nine years
old, just mind blown.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
My momma goes, you want
to go see the movie?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And that changed my life.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here is
nodding, because you all

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
have the same exact
stories, don't you?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear it.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So this career path
started for me.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:90%
And here I am today.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm 55.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's 50 years after
this book is released.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I am able to
interview and meet people

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and do things
because of that book.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
That book is what
brought me here.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
That book is what brought
everybody in this room tonight.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many
people are here.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
That book brought you here.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
I like to take selfies.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
That little seven-year-old
kid, Erich von Daniken,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%
man, I'm reading his stuff.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And I grow up.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And I take this selfie.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.637 align:middle line:90%
Bust it up on the screen.

00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:56.345 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at that selfie.

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
How does-- I got a
lump in my throat--

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
how does a little kid grow up
admiring somebody like Erich

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
von Daniken and
have the opportunity

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
to take a selfie like that?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And look, you don't see
[? Tsoukalos ?] and his hair.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't see Jason
Martell and his teeth.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:90%
You don't even see me.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Look at that man in the
background, Erich von Daniken.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's who we are
celebrating tonight.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:90%
He changed my life.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%
He changed yours.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would like everybody
to welcome to this stage--

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:90%
up on your feet--

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Erich von Daniken.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.658 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.466 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's come out
to the center here.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.413 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Erich von Daniken.

00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:56.265 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks ago, I
interviewed Erich on "Coast

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to Coast."

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.043 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you
guys all listened in,

00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and that was great.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And Erich and I talked
before the show that night.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said Erich,
let's have fun,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:90%
let's enjoy this interview.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And Erich said this to me,
he goes, Jimmy, you're loud,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.508 align:middle line:90%
you're funny, and you're smart.

00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
great conversation tonight.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And he got two out
of three right.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.277 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that, Erich?

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Now really quick, before we
sit down and enjoy this evening

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of celebration, I
just have to ask you,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago did you have any
idea that you would change

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
the world and affect
people's lives like you have,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
where it continues to this
day, where you have caused

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:84%
a paradigm shift
for so many people?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any idea
this was going to happen?

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When "Chariots of the
Gods" was in the market,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
the German speaking market,
I was sure I was sitting

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:90%
on a volcano.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was
crashed down by everybody.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But I was never
thinking that this would

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:90%
become a worldwide phenomenon.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Now it happened, in the
meantime, more than 76

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:84%
million books entitled "Chariots
of the Gods" are on the market.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.697 align:middle line:84%
And we have a change
in this period of time.

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> On behalf of everybody
listening around the world,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
everybody here tonight, the 2019
Conscious Life Expo tonight,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
we are celebrating 50 years
of "Chariots of the Gods."

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Erich, stand right
there for a second.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This book has meant
so much to me.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
And I am-- do I know you?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.578 align:middle line:90%
Have we ever met?

00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] years ago.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.703 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's good enough.

00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Come on up on the stage.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Just come up here.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.477 align:middle line:10%
Stand right here.

00:06:56.477 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:10%
And if you could, because
I need both hands,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:10%
hold this book for me.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this-- I need you
to answer two questions

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:90%
and then repeat after me.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The answer is--
what is your name?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Arielle [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Arielle, right.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
What is your favorite color?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Pink.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Pink.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want you to
turn to Erich, and I

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
want you to repeat after me.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Say, Erich.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Erich.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mr. von Daniken.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Mr. von Daniken.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you please sign my
copy of "Chariots of the Gods?"

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Say it.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you please sign my
copy of "Chariots of the God?

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a great pleasure.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored to do this for you.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wait.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you need this.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Arielle.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:90%
What a champion, right?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a special moment.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what life is all about.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Arielle, thank you so
much for being a champion.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Mr. von Daniken, if you
could, take the seat

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:90%
of honor in the middle.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:90%
And let's kick this things off.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys ready?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't believe you.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.354 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:21.354 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
We know her as a researcher,
a director, a producer,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
a documentarian, and, of
course, the proprietor

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is Linda?

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.744 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.744 --> 00:08:49.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jimmy.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed this young
man a couple of weeks ago

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
He's also featured

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:90%
He's a teacher.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:90%
He's an author.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:90%
He's amazing.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And he also rides
a Harley Davidson.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome Rabbi

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.279 align:middle line:90%

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Next up, he has been

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and also featured on the cover
of Men's Health magazine,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Jason Martell.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.896 align:middle line:90%
Jason, come on out.

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:14.211 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Come down next to me, Jason.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Appreciate the
Men's Health part.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Not quite.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say GQ, but--

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:90%
What an honor.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And let's just start
where we should start.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to start with Mr.
Erich von Daniken, of course.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And Erich, I have two
questions for you.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here wants to
leave with something that they

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:90%
didn't know when they came in.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
You've been asked
every question that

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.732 align:middle line:90%
could possibly be asked of you.

00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going ask you
something that hopefully you've

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:90%
never been asked.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there one thing in
"Chariots of the Gods"

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that people don't pay attention
to that makes you angry?

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there one thing that you
want people to know more about

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and understand?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, "Chariots of the Gods"
was a very provocative book.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:10%
And what people never realized
in "Chariots of the Gods,"

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:10%
I have 238 question marks.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
People don't see
the question marks.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that, actually?

00:11:30.848 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because in
"Chariots of the Gods,"

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I was not completely sure
of everything what I wrote.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I was
on the right track.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But I had myself a
lot of question marks.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
In the meantime, I'm an old man.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I am 84 years old.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.968 align:middle line:84%
And I have no more
question marks.

00:11:46.968 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We just learned something.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Second question.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
What is your favorite
part of the book?

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
All of the sites, all of the
evidence, the Colombian, right.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Right, OK.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.033 align:middle line:84%
What's your favorite piece
of evidence in the book?

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in "Chariots
of the Gods"

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
you have to differentiate
between evidence is coming out

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:84%
from old holy
writings and facts,

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
evidence you can see and
touch and photograph.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And the best evidence in
"Chariots of the Gods"

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:10%
is definitely the
tombstone of Palenque.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Palenque is a Mayan
city in Central America.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is a pyramid called
the Temple of Inscription.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And deep under this
pyramid, in the ground,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
seven meter under the pyramid,
in 1952, they found a tomb.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The tomb was a seven
meters high a room

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
filled with stalactites
and stalagmites, which

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:84%
means the tomb must
be very, very old.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because seven meter long
stalactites and stalagmites.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They pushed away
these stalactites

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and they were standing on a big
stone plate, big three meter,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%
80 long, two meter, 20 large.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
That's quite a block
from there to here.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And under stone, an
incredible chiseling.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
You see something like a frame.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the frame, a man

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is sitting bending forward,
almost like a racing

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:90%
motorcyclist.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
You see he has a
mask on his nose.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:10%
He uses his upper hand,
clearly you can see,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:10%
to manipulate some controls.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
You see the lower hand.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
You still see the forefinger
of the back of his hands.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
He's manipulating, he's
winding something up.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting on a chair.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And outside of the frame,
you see a [? linking ?]

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:90%
[? flame. ?]

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.047 align:middle line:10%
Now this was
absolutely sensational

00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:10%
in "Chariots of the Gods."

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I was the first
one who published

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that had written about this,
or published a picture.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Of course, archeology
has come with a lot

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
of counter arguments.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, this is
just the second last ruler

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:90%
of the city of Palenque.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
His name is Pakal,
which is true.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:90%
It is Pakal.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It is represent.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, he's
not sitting in a frame.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:10%
He's sitting in the open mouth
of a mythological monster.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:90%
So he's dying.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And out of his chest, the
tree of life is coming

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:90%
and the cross of life is coming.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of archaeological
nonsense, you don't believe it.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, over
50 years have passed.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And the newest
scientific explanation,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
really top scientists, are
the two American professors,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Stuart and Stuart, the
father and the son.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
have the same name.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They are the best
Mayan specialists

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
who can now translate
the writing which

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:90%
is around the tombstone.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And they say, yes, it is Pakal.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Pakal was the second
last ruler of Palenque.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But Pakal is representing
on the tombstone everything

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with the
cosmos, the universe.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:90%
He's leaving our planet Earth.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So finally, after 50 years,
they changed their mind

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.208 align:middle line:84%
and say, come on, Erich
von Deniken was not so bad.

00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:02.196 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:02.196 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was on
the cover of this.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
things that blew my mind--

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm speaking for
everybody in this room--

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
was the image of
the little sphere

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
with the flames coming off
the back and the little point

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
on the front and the little
dude in the middle of it.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yugoslavia.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, right.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
With the little pilot
looking out the window.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And he's kind of staring.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
What else could that be but
what is in the image, Erich?

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there another
explanation for that now?

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, to understand
all these things,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
be it the tombstone of Palenque
or be it that example from

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Yugoslavia, you have to
understand what cargo cult is.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Very brief.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
When two societies
came together,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
a technological high society
and a technological low society,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
the lower society does not
understand the technology

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:90%
of the higher society.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:10%
And then they start to imitate
stuff which they have seen.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:10%
Although they don't know
what it is, they imitate it.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing happened
with the tombstone of Palenque.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:84%
They saw somebody in a sort
of car, moving, et cetera.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.763 align:middle line:84%
And they chiseled
it, copied something.

00:16:24.763 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
with the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, the man who
is looking backward,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
he is in a sort of
a UFO or whatever.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's obviously looking back.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
He's afraid, because
somebody is following him,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
somebody tries to
shoot him down.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is all cargo cult.
This is all imitation.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It changed the world, Erich.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is very rare
that somebody changes

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
the world, changes minds.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And you did just that.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say it as
we continue, one more time,

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I would like everybody to
show your appreciation.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:90%
You changed the world, Erich.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.158 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:08.854 align:middle line:84%
Yes, thank you, thank you,
for your understanding.

00:17:08.854 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm happy.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
The situation has changed.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
beginning, I mean,

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:19.119 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, every serious
personality was against it.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
You were crushed down by
the scientific community.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
You were crushed down
by the astronomers.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
You were crushed down
by the archaeologists.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Of course, by the theologians.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Because in "Chariots
of the God,"

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:10%
I was speaking about the prophet
Ezekiel in the Old Testament.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said Ezekiel
did not had a vision.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
He really saw a chariot,
the flying chariot.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
He describes it with the
wings and the wheels.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
By the way, tomorrow
in my speech,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I will give you the
most modern explanation

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:90%
concerning Ezekiel, et cetera.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So it has changed the world.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, 50
years ago, they said,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the scientific community,
even if von Daniken is right,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
even if maybe extraterrestrials
do exist somewhere,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.273 align:middle line:84%
they would never
look like humans.

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
they would look

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
like some monsters with
tentacles or whatever,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:90%
but never like humans.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, we know
we are simply copies of it.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:10%
The so-called gods
created humans

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:10%
according their own image.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So this does not exclude that
you have monsters out there.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:10%
But there are beings,
extraterrestrials,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:10%
similar to us or we
are similar to them.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So in the meantime, the
situation has changed.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, even
if this is possible,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials do exist,
they do look like human,

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
then we would never
come together.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:10%
Because the distances
between the stars

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:10%
are measured in light years,
and you have no technical way

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:10%
to cross these light years.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we know,
yes, it is possible.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We know how we could do
it, how we could travel

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:84%
without reaching speed of
light, just with 1% or 2%

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:90%
of the speed of light.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:10%
We can do it.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:10%
So the situation has changed.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:10%
In the meantime,
all this crash down

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:10%
has stopped, at least among
the reasonable people.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:10%
And slowly, we start
to understand, hey,

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:10%
we must think it over.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:10%
The gods of antiquity,
the so-called gods,

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:10%
were, in reality, astronauts.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And by saying so, you
never lose your god.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:10%
You know, I suppose that
we were visited by beings

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:10%
from outer space
in Stone Age time.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Our Stone Age people
could not understand

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
what these visitors
were, because it

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:90%
was a high technology.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:10%
So they believe
that these visitors

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:10%
are the gods, or some gods.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:90%
We all know there are no gods.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:10%
There's only one God.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you accept this basic
idea, you have to say,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
all right, so we were visited
by beings from outer space.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:90%
What is their evolution?

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You can go on and
say, they were visited

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
by another solar system.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, where did they come from?

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can continue the
game from hundred thousands

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of millions of years, finally
you came to a starting point

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
where in every respect, with
religion, you have to say,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:90%
here is God.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Here is creation.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
So you never lose the real God.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.333 align:middle line:10%
I am still one of these
figures who pray every evening.

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you for that.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:10%
And with all of the critics,
Erich, over the years.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:90%
You've written 30 plus books.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
You've kept up the good fight.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But they kept the pressure
on you, too, as well.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.445 align:middle line:10%
Was there ever a point-- thank
goodness you didn't give up--

00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:10%
but was there ever a
point where you're like,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:10%
you know what, I'm just tired?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't, I can't
do this anymore.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it is not my character.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
As more as I am attack,
as more I fight back.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good fighter, yeah.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>> As it should be.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Rabbi
Ariel Bar Tzadok.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi, I'm going to ask
the same question with all

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:84%
of the panelists
tonight, because we all

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
have that one thing that we got
from "Chariots of the Gods."

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
For you, what's the one thing
that you want the world to know

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:90%
about "Chariots of the Gods?"

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the one thing
that stirs you?

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would think my
experience with the book might

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:90%
be different from many others.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I came to the book at a very
much older age, probably,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I would think in
my 30s or older.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm very
well aware of what--

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.792 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't look but 35.

00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm obviously very
well aware of what Erich has

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
written, and that,
needless to say,

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
there are things that
we do disagree with.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the point.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not even important.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:10%
Simply because what
Erich has been doing

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:10%
is creating a phenomenon.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Matter of fact, the
point that Linda and I

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:10%
were discussing just before we
came onto our panel tonight.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
We were discussing how things
happen in certain ways,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
in certain times.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Like the Bible says,
there's a time and a purpose

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:90%
for all things under heaven.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Or what Carl Jung would
say, that they're actually

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
like waves that happen in
the collective unconscious.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Revelations come in all
kinds of different ways.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't necessarily have to
come from a religious figure

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
through the context of any
kind of a spiritual movement.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've shared
this with Erich,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I've shared this with the
producers of Prometheus, who

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
make the "Ancient
Aliens" TV program,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that they've
created a phenomena.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they've opened up
the floodgates to ask many,

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:90%
many questions.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:10%
From my background in the
Kabbalistic Torah tradition,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:10%
I will say we haven't
asked enough questions yet.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking at,
the examples that we've

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:10%
discussed tonight, there are
all kinds of ideas and beliefs

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:10%
that people have.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:10%
But like Erich said,
the question marks,

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.272 align:middle line:10%
those must never disappear,
must always be there.

00:23:00.272 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:10%
Because I think we're
just at the surface

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:10%
of understanding things.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:10%
Our tradition, as we've shared
on our radio interviews,

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:10%
is not that they
come from out there,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:10%
but that they came from here,
that they evolved from here,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:10%
and that they are us,
pre-Adamic civilizations who've

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:10%
been here on Earth maybe
even millions of years.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And as such, they have
gone to the stars.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they have such
a connection to our planet

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and to us.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:90%
We're their children.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way that we've
always understood things.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that respect,
the methods and ways

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
in the prophetic tradition
through psychic, telepathic

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
[? evolving, ?] how we maintain
contact and communication.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you suggesting then
that "Chariots of the Gods"

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:10%
has given you the comfort zone
for going public with such

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:10%
radical ideas?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Where what-- yeah,
you laugh, right?

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't consider the ideas
that I represent to be radical.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually representing
classical, traditional,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
orthodox, rabbinic
Kabbalistic stick

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
teachings that are readily
available in dozens

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of Hebraic texts in any Jewish
bookstore around the world

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
for those people who want
to pick them up and learn.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:10%
And like I was sharing,
what Erich has done,

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:10%
and what is now
happening, why we're here,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:10%
it's all, if you will, in
quote, sign of the times.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Things are progressing.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness,
knowledge is evolving.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:90%
And Erich is part of that.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:10%
It's not just that he's an
author who writes a book

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:10%
because that's what we have
to do to make a living.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:84%
No, this is much
greater than that.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And he's part of a phenomena.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:90%
We are part of a phenomena.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who is here is
part of a phenomenon.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is a continuing growth
process that's happening.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think
we've even, like I

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:10%
said, scratched the surface of
what we have yet to discover.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's heavy, right?

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Billy Carson.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Billy, Billy, Billy.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Billy, Billy, Billy.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:90%
How you doing, man?

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm doing great, Jimmy.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Billy, 4biddenknowledge,
the things that you talk about,

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
the things that you
are bringing forward,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely amazing, and
your knowledge of ancient Egypt

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and going further
back than that.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And you actually get out
there and go around the world

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and do what's
supposed to be done.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:90%
You do the research.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you just get back from?

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I technically
just got back from Tahiti.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, see what I'm saying?

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.645 align:middle line:90%
Lots of Mayan culture in Tahiti.

00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But I just got back from
Peru, Machu Picchu, Cusco,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Lima, of course,
the Nazca Lines.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a great trip.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Phenomenal.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't you propose to
somebody in Machu Picchu?

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
My fiancee is sitting
right here in the audience.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm talking--

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Got me beat on that one.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:90%
How do you top that?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, Rita looks at me
like, what's your problem?

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:90%
What's your problem?

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So for you, with "Chariots
of the Gods," right,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
it's the thing that
changes all of us.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
What's the one thing
that you take away

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
from "Chariots of the Gods?"

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.733 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most amazing
things that I could take away

00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
from "Chariots of the
Gods" were the Nazca Lines.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first time
I had my experience

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:90%
with it was the actual movie.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have the book first.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And so going, how it tied
in with the Nazca Lines

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
was when I was a young child
in my backyard, I saw a UFO.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:90%
We live close to an airport.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And this UFO came
over my backyard.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was not a airplane.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:90%
This is like 1977.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So an airplane, I knew
what it looked like.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:90%
But UFOs weren't in my mind.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
They weren't on TV.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
We only had three or
four channels back then.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like I was
being pre-programmed

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
into thinking about UFOs.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that this object
didn't look like an airplane.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So I started researching and
researching and researching.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I came across
information at the library,

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
through the
Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.078 align:middle line:84%
about all the different
forms of aerospace technology

00:27:28.078 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:90%
that was available to us.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find
anything like what I saw.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Then a few years later,
I came across information

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
about "Chariots of the
Gods," and I never really

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:90%
looked into it too much.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.172 align:middle line:90%
I just saw the book.

00:27:39.172 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I never really read it.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.755 align:middle line:84%
But then a few years
after that, then I

00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:90%
ended up seeing the movie.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was blown away.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to explain
to my mom what I saw.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And she sat me down and told
me about the Nazca Lines.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And she told me-- this is
back in, a long time ago--

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and she's telling me that
there was an ancient,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
she thought it might have been
an ancient airport in Peru.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:90%
And it blew me away.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when I saw the movie,
and then eventually read

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
the book, it just was like one
of the biggest driving forces.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I had to get there.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.638 align:middle line:84%
It was on the top
of my to-do list.

00:28:09.638 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me jump in and just say
that a couple of months ago,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Billy flies to Peru and shoots
a video, him in the plane,

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:90%
flying over the Nazca Lines--

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.040 align:middle line:90%
with his fiancee there, right--

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:90%
flying over the Nazca Lines.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And his excitement of
shooting this video

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely incredible.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And I have to--

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
what was that like, flying
over the Nazca Lines

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
after seeing it
for so many years?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a dream come true.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, my mom,
bless her soul, has passed away.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And she used to tell me about
a lot of ancient things.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And my family's been tied into
a lot of very strange things,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
like top secret
architecture with NASA.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather's
team was tasked

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to go out and refurbish the
Great Pyramid and the Sphinx,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So it was like one
of the things that

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:10%
just felt like I was
going on the same path

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:10%
and journey as my family
members and living out,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:10%
you know, maybe
fulfilling their wishes

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.773 align:middle line:10%
and their dreams
through me, just

00:29:13.773 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:10%
through some of the
conversations that we had.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:90%
So it was a great experience.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a life
changing experience.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.492 align:middle line:90%
And I want to thank my fiancee.

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.867 align:middle line:84%
Because she actually bought
me that trip for my birthday.

00:29:22.867 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:90%
It was my birthday gift.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It didn't get any
better than that.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Linda, Linda, Linda.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:90%
How you doing, Linda?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am provoked
by what he's saying.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I was flying in a
Piper Cub over the Nazca Lines

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:90%
in 1986, in June.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot was
nice enough to say,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I can take you anywhere for
at least an hour and a half.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
really wanted to get down low.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
that six mile long

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:84%
triangle that some
people call airport or--

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I would really like for you
to go down as low as you can

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
photograph as we go.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're
going to be surprised.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear all about Maria
Reiche saying that these were

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:90%
trudged by the feet of locals--

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, wait till you see
what it looks like for real.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:90%
So we're in this Piper Cub.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:90%
I've got the camera ready.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
He starts coming down
right at the end of it,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:90%
goes for six miles.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.180 align:middle line:90%
I still have the photographs.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if
you took pressure

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and you pressed down
a couple of feet

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:84%
into the soil from the
surface for six miles.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And NASA and others
have done laser,

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
where you look at
what the edges are,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and lasers that
are nearly perfect.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Straight.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So the pilot said, I can fly
you for an hour from the Nazca

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.260 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And we went up from
what everybody goes,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:90%
we went into the Andes.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And there were patterns
impressed into the ground

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:90%
an hour out of Nazca.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why is this
not being reported?

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Why is the Reiche point of view
that these are people trudging

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%
through ground with their feet?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
people have made money

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:90%
on tourism the other way.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, those of us
who live here and fly,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:90%
we know this is not possible.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know-- and he
took me up to another high,

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:90%
it was really high.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It isn't any place the people
could have walked and trudged.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And it went like in, if
you go about, let's see,

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
it's about 90 minutes outside
of Nazca, maybe an hour.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:84%
There's another area that
has a tremendous number

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of geometries.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite different
than the plains of Nazca.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
The pilots that fly that region,
they look at the whole thing.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
We only hear about
the planes of Nazca.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And he said, when you
go to the altitudes

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:10%
that some of these patterns are
an hour going into the Andes,

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:10%
nobody could do this.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
That was 1986 with a
pilot flying me around.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And those photos that I
have of that six miles--

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's pressed in.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, how would
anybody on the planet do this?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, on the other
side is where Erich introduced,

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
from my point of
view, the truth.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Erich,
I don't know if you've

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:25.410 align:middle line:90%
talked with Michio Kaku at NYU.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But I interviewed Michio
Kaku, the scientist

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:84%
who has done a variety
of books having

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to do with hyperspace and
black holes and time travel.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And Michio Kaku told me--

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and he's written about
this very thing-- he said,

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.630 align:middle line:84%
we are very provincial
on the earth.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
We constantly are referencing
everything through us,

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
when it should be
the other way around.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.890 align:middle line:84%
That if you are in a 13.8
billion light year universe,

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:90%
it's almost 12.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You can divide it
by 4, 4 epochs,

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and you'll have 3 billion per.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This planet is 4.6
billion years old.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can easily be
in the last of, say,

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:90%
four epochs in the universe.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he comes
up with other civilizations.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So that the Palenque
astronaut would

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:29.620 align:middle line:84%
be an advanced intelligence
that came, mixed genes.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.320 align:middle line:84%
This Earth has been used,
I think, as a laboratory

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And because we are
human-noid, it's

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
because there are
humanoids out there.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.909 align:middle line:84%
And one other really
important thing

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to share with this audience,
who probably has read John Keel.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
I flew back from a
conference run probably '92,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in there,
with John Keel.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.537 align:middle line:90%
And we were on an airliner.

00:34:58.537 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And we had been at a conference.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And Budd Hopkins and
Keel and I had been

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.100 align:middle line:90%
talking about several things.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, in
a kind of innocence--

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming into all of this
through animal mutilations,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
which people have a
very hard time with--

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:84%
but from my point of view,
talking with the government,

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:84%
it's a genetic harvest, and all
kinds of containers are made,

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and it actually
has a logic, if you

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:84%
come from outside of
the universe to earth,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:90%
not earth going out.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And the entire issue of
why are the way we are,

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I said to John Keel,
on that airliner,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
well, where do you put
the graves, the reptiles,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:84%
the praying mantises,
the tall lights?

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember--
he was a big man.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:90%
He was really quite huge.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of pulled himself
up in the airline seat.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he says, Linda, there

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:84%
is nothing in this
universe except humanoids.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never heard this before.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
This goes all the way
back to around 1992.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why, why
are you saying that?

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, because the
original prime intelligence

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:90%
in this universe, it's humanoid.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:90%
We are like them.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:90%
John Keel.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they
manipulated DNA here.

00:36:38.987 --> 00:36:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Goes right back to what
the rabbi said earlier.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When she was
talking about Nazca.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And on television, you
always see Nazca pictures,

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, birds, spiders,
monkeys, all these figures.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow in my speech,
I show you Nazca Lines

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:90%
which you have never seen.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely shocking.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because they
exist way beyond the plain.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the part that
people don't hear about.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Jason Martell.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Smile for everybody.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at them chops.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:90%
All right, Jason Martell.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Jason, you have been involved
with "Ancient Aliens"

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:90%
since its inception.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:90%
You have a great relationship.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But how has "Chariots of
the Gods" changed you?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
What's the one-- so Jason
comes up to me backstage.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Check it out, man, 1968 edition.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:90%
You can't even touch it.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.837 align:middle line:90%
Don't even look at it.

00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I got it right here.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:90%
He had it in his pocket.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.250 align:middle line:90%
How has it changed you?

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I know we
only want to talk about one

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.760 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.177 align:middle line:84%
But you know, so
there's the book.

00:37:46.177 --> 00:37:47.787 align:middle line:84%
But then there
was also the video

00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:90%
of "Chariots of the Gods."

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Then there's also "The
Mysteries Continue, Part Two."

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And so just one comment
about the Nazca piece,

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.660 align:middle line:84%
in his video, when you
go up into the mountains

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:84%
there, these geometric patterns
that you see everywhere--

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and I always remember his
comments, because he'd be like,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:84%
there are scorpions everywhere,
so I wouldn't go there.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you go up from
a height and look down,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:90%
there's not just lines.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:84%
You see these very
advanced diagrams.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen that
outside of Erich's research.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's clearly something
beyond just some tribe

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:90%
scraping things in the ground.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:29.280 align:middle line:84%
There's literally complex
math happening there.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.047 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that
really caught my attention

00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that I always thought
was interesting,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.588 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping maybe
Erich will speak about it,

00:38:35.588 --> 00:38:39.697 align:middle line:84%
is in "The Mysteries
Continue," you actually show--

00:38:39.697 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot where
it is, I apologize,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
it might be Chichen
Itza, I'm not sure.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But you actually show that
some of these pyramids

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
were topped with
a white covering,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.383 align:middle line:90%
a bright white covering.

00:38:51.383 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And you actually
went to some spot

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:10%
where you opened up
a part of the ground

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.770 align:middle line:10%
where they had been throwing
this mica, the stone, the mica

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.350 align:middle line:10%
in there, and explaining how
it was a very rare stone that

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:10%
used to top the pyramid.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.160 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, was fascinating.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because there's all
these rumors about even

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian pyramids
and other pyramids having

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.158 align:middle line:84%
an outside coating that
was much more complex.

00:39:12.158 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one of
the things, I think,

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.033 align:middle line:84%
that really caught my
attention, to keep it short.

00:39:16.033 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:10%
But I'd love to hear your
comments on that mica.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, boy, that really
caught my attention.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this mica was
found in Teotihuacan.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Teotihuacan is Mexico.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:90%
It is easy for you to go there.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just about 30 kilometers
out of Mexico City.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.250 align:middle line:84%
There are gigantic pyramids
and the so-called Street

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead in the center.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And just near to the
Street of the Dead,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
it's only about 15
meters away, just near

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to a pyramid is a chamber,
a subterranean chamber,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and since a few
years, it's open.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And then you can open the--

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:90%
how you call it?

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.070 align:middle line:10%
The lid, and then you
see mica, mica, mica.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:10%
It's all mica, the full
chamber is filled with mica.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is a real mystery.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists in
Mexico, they do know,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:90%
what is this mica for?

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Where does mica come from?

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But now, mica were found not
only in Mexico, at Teotihuacan,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in at least four other places,
including Tikal, which is Maya,

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:90%
including Egypt, et cetera.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:10%
Now in the old Hindu books, the
Mahabharata, the fifth book in

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.820 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE],, they describe
different flying objects

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:10%
called vimanas.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And these vimanas needed
some special fuel.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:10%
The fuel is a mixture
of different components.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
components was mica.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So maybe mica, the
deposit of mica,

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.560 align:middle line:10%
and the different
places around the world,

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:10%
was because they need it.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a component
of their fuel.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Without mica, they
could not fly.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing, for me,
when we talk about this,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.200 align:middle line:84%
which is so important, is that
orthodox academia is going

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to say that Stone Age man
didn't have the ability to do--

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.930 align:middle line:90%
certainly in Peru, no writing.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:16.405 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of that
stuff was lacking, paper,

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But the intelligence
of doing work

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.990 align:middle line:84%
with mica, or other
materials back then,

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:84%
either we were smarter than
we're giving credit for or not.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:90%
But you can't have it both ways.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Why is it, Erich,
that modern academia

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.200 align:middle line:84%
will fight this and say
that it was Stone Age

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.202 align:middle line:90%
man that was doing it.

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it was
Stone Age man, they

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
intelligence to do it.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Why won't they give in?

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Why this pushback?

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, the
modern archeology,

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.850 align:middle line:84%
everything is
based on evolution.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:10%
Evolution starts slowly, slowly.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You have a technical evolution,
but it becomes bigger.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Our knowledge becomes bigger.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Our technology becomes more
complicated, et cetera.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.280 align:middle line:10%
They say, it's all a
process of evolution,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:10%
which I do not agree.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:10%
It's not only a
process of evolution,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.000 align:middle line:10%
it is quite possible,
like the rabbi

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.960 align:middle line:10%
said before, that some unknown
hundred thousands of years

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.680 align:middle line:10%
ago or whatever, we had already
a high civilization here.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
But this discredits evolution,
the story of evolution.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So just because of this dogma of
evolution, they are saying all

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:90%
this is not possible.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Could I add--

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, actually,
hold that note.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
We're all wearing
the famous, you

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.710 align:middle line:84%
know, from "Chariots of the
Gods," the Colombian jet,

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:90%
What year were these created?

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Created?

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:90%
What year?

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%
What year?

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Like actually
the replicas were--

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, the real ones.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:90%
The real ones.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.130 align:middle line:84%
When they came out of the
river in Colombia, yes.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was found
in a tomb in Colombia,

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:84%
in a tomb which is at
least about 1,500 BC.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.730 align:middle line:90%
So it came from the date--

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:10.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:43:10.727 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I'm sorry, but this,
we're all wearing the pins

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.115 align:middle line:84%
tonight, I stole this
one from Giorgio.

00:43:18.115 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:26.120 align:middle line:84%
There's only one thing
that that represents.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.082 align:middle line:90%
And that's a jet.

00:43:27.082 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know it's on
display as an insect model.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, as an insect.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's this kind
of stuff that we

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:90%
get from "Chariots the Gods."

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget the
first time that I saw this.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
thing that that is.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not an insect.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not a bug.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.355 align:middle line:84%
They saw something,
right, they recreated it.

00:43:48.355 --> 00:43:49.980 align:middle line:84%
There was something
going on back then.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they want us to
believe that that is a bug.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:10%
>> But you know one thing, the
original was found in a tomb

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:10%
of a very rich Indian chief.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:10%
We don't know his name.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And the original is of gold,
original full, pure gold.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:84%
If it would have been
simply an insect,

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:84%
they never adored
an insect in gold.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.970 align:middle line:10%
It must be has
something much higher

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:10%
than an insect, something
which they adored,

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:10%
which they pray to, which
they wish to come back.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.720 align:middle line:10%
By the way, the original
of it, since many years,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:10%
is in the gold museum in Bogota,
at the National Bank in Bogota,

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:10%
open for tourists.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You can go there and you
see it's behind thick glass.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
You can photograph
it, the original.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you're going to
do with gold so many years ago,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
something so precious,
so important,

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:90%
is make a model of a fly.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I just don't--

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that a
good use of resources.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And staying on this, Erich,
when this information

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:84%
has come forward, like
Pacal, Puma Punku,

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:84%
all of these ancient,
ancient pieces of evidence,

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.970 align:middle line:90%
each one of them gets fought.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that we keep
going back to this.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But everything gets
fought when, if you

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
went to anybody on the street
and said, what does this

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.140 align:middle line:84%
represent to you, what does
this represent, what does

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
this look like to
you, they're going

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:90%
to give you an honest answer.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:90%
But instead, we get fought.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't under-- is it
because they have blinders on

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to see what we see?

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.770 align:middle line:90%
They have blinders on.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
see what is normal.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
normally anymore.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:90%
They think complicated.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Could I add two things?

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Linda, go ahead.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
because power brokers,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with a capital P
and a capital B,

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.820 align:middle line:84%
have been manipulating
the planet for so long.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And the power brokers
may not necessarily

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
be Homo sapiens sapien.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Dot, dot, dot.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, clarify.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow, I'm
going to show here,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.940 align:middle line:84%
in a workshop, two
pieces of a hour I'm

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.140 align:middle line:84%
doing with a Navy SEAL
who is backlighted

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and voice altered
about Antarctica.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to
what we're talking about

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:27.060 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the age of this
and the age of so many things

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that Homo sapiens sapien could
not have anything to do with.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow, I'm going to,
in addition to having the--

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
he's a real Navy SEAL.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I think he is the first ever
of a Navy SEAL on record

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.890 align:middle line:84%
who has walked in this
underground archeology

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.700 align:middle line:84%
under two miles of ice in
Antarctica on a mission.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:90%
And to hear him talk--

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> He's here--

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> In my video.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, I was like,
I want to meet this guy.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.767 align:middle line:84%
I've been unfolding this
on my YouTube channel.

00:47:02.767 --> 00:47:03.600 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.840 align:middle line:90%
--do this.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.000 align:middle line:84%
That I don't think
anybody's ever

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.760 align:middle line:84%
heard a Navy SEAL who has
walked in this archeology

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:90%
two miles down under ice.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this somebody
that would go public?

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:26.170 align:middle line:84%
No, if I told you, it's taken me
two years to get to this point.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And in those two years, my
life has been threatened,

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.830 align:middle line:90%
his life has been threatened.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's been unreal.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I hope everybody
comes tomorrow to hear him.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:90%
He deserves to be heard.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, why would
somebody who is a Navy SEAL

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.440 align:middle line:90%
speak out to you?

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that
some of the people who

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.830 align:middle line:84%
have been in Special Forces
have seen me on television,

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.700 align:middle line:84%
in "Ancient Aliens" and now
the YouTube channel that I

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.310 align:middle line:84%
do on Wednesdays,
and I'm getting

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:05.340 align:middle line:84%
more and more communications
than I ever have had before.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's has something to
do with the administration.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But here's what
it boils down to.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:19.190 align:middle line:10%
If there are 62 acre--

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.400 align:middle line:10%
and this is what we've
measured by ground penetrating

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:10%
and ground ice
penetrating radar--

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:31.060 align:middle line:10%
the two miles down in a
specific latitude and longitude,

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.700 align:middle line:10%
which I know where it is,
but I'm trying to also

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.390 align:middle line:10%
be responsible and I'm
not giving that out yet,

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.900 align:middle line:10%
but I'm giving
the general area--

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.780 align:middle line:10%
there's half a
dozen, 62 acres each.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The structures are huge,
80 foot tall ceilings,

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.160 align:middle line:90%
30, 40 foot corridors.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Energy is still in them as the
Special Forces mission move

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.910 align:middle line:90%
through, light.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Only it's a lime green.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.410 align:middle line:90%
But it reacts to what is moving.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.390 align:middle line:84%
They look for the
energy sources.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to understand
how is this two miles

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.690 align:middle line:90%
under the ice still powered?

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But here is-- if you leave
tonight with no other thing

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:90%
to think about, it is this--

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I asked the SEAL,
and another one who's

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:30.630 align:middle line:84%
been there three times, that
I don't have on video yet,

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and I said, how could these
have been built with ice,

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.578 align:middle line:90%
two miles of ice?

00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
it's our understanding

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.770 align:middle line:90%
that it was built before.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You can start doing
this yourself.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Go to Google, go to
Wikipedia, go to geophysics,

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and say, when was the
last time that Antarctica

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:90%
was free of ice?

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.605 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:49:56.605 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You would think, in
this world, that we

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:90%
would have an exact answer.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not clear.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
A consensus is 34
million years ago.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And let me just
give you a couple

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.030 align:middle line:90%
of things to think about.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.620 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
Gondwanaland and Pangea,

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
when the world land was
congealed, let's call it that.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
About 100 million
years ago, something

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:31.040 align:middle line:84%
was happening volcanically,
chaos in the Earth's magma,

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.020 align:middle line:90%
who knows.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:39.950 align:middle line:84%
A round piece of land as
wide as the United States,

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica is as wide
as the United States.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.860 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.740 align:middle line:90%
It has a circular shape.

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Not a circle, a circular shape.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:10%
It starts coming down
between 100 million years ago

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.460 align:middle line:10%
and 34 million years ago.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:05.730 align:middle line:10%
And during that entire
period, it was hot, tropical.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:84%
The pollen is palm trees and all
the things that would grow only

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.960 align:middle line:90%
in certain temperatures.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
From 34 million years ago
to 33 million years ago,

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:90%
something dramatic happened.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That's when, by 33 million,
ice was building up

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.670 align:middle line:84%
over the entire continent
that had moved down

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:90%
to the South Pole.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It had been in the South Pole
position and was tropical, hot.

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
As the SEAL and I talked, if
that geophysical timeline is

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
true, and that's, right now
I'm posing it as a thought

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:58.390 align:middle line:84%
exercise, then all of those 62
acre sites two miles under ice,

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the SEALs are getting
to by submarines.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.297 align:middle line:84%
There is a submarine
entrance, whoever made it.

00:52:07.297 --> 00:52:08.630 align:middle line:90%
They have other ways of getting.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are six
of these, or seven.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And the structure
is black basalt.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.440 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the hardest
stones on planet Earth.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It's up there with granite.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And everything is made
out of this black basalt

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:37.890 align:middle line:84%
with hieroglyphs and patterns
that are carved all over.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:42.180 align:middle line:84%
The doors of sections that
the Navy SEAL that you

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.850 align:middle line:90%
will hear tomorrow walked--

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:84%
because his job was
to come and extract

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.950 align:middle line:84%
an archaeologist who
was there photographing

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:84%
all of the symbols,
all of the patterns,

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.270 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what
the language is.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It looks a little
bit like Egyptian,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.110 align:middle line:90%
a little bit like Mayan.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's not known.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:04.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, you walk
up and they had

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:10.750 align:middle line:84%
measured each door in this
huge thing was 18 feet thick.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.510 align:middle line:84%
How would you even
make anything with

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:18.400 align:middle line:84%
an 18-foot solid black basalt
door that would even move?

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and all they had to
do was take their index finger

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and touch it.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And that on the upper left and
the lower left of this 18-foot

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:33.620 align:middle line:84%
thick black basalt
were technologies--

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
those were his terms, they
didn't understand it at all.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.780 align:middle line:84%
If they just touched
the door it opened.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.460 align:middle line:90%
They would walk through--

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.360 align:middle line:84%
these are SEALs-- they
would turn around.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And on the backside of each
door was the same pattern.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I took a notebook.

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to front
load with anybody.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.530 align:middle line:84%
This was very dangerous
what I was doing.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The only way I could do
it was me videotaping.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And I put together
a notebook that

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:84%
had a whole bunch of
different things in it.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just asked
him, I said, can you

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:16.030 align:middle line:84%
just flip through
and see if there's

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:19.450 align:middle line:84%
anything that
resembles what you saw

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:21.550 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of these doors?

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> What did he find?

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Tell me right now.

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm on the edge of my seat.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a circle.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> 12 lines with two 90
degree angles at the end.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.770 align:middle line:90%
A ring.

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the black sun.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.720 align:middle line:84%
He knew nothing about the
black sun with Hitler.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.565 align:middle line:84%
It was on the backside
of each of those doors.

00:54:47.565 --> 00:54:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:57.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's 34 million years
old, the black sun antecedent

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:02.960 align:middle line:84%
has absolutely nothing to
do with Homo sapiens sapien

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:84%
or Neanderthalensis or
Denisovan, or Homo Erectus.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The standing up
primates on planet Earth

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.810 align:middle line:90%
are only two million years old.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Put it in your mind in
a fraction, 2 million

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.780 align:middle line:90%
over 34 million.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line.

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.450 align:middle line:84%
This planet, this
solar system, has

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:33.160 align:middle line:84%
had habitation that would go
back millions and millions

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and millions of years before
the first primate ever

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:37.270 align:middle line:90%
stood up on Earth.

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:45.040 align:middle line:84%
If our planet is a laboratory,
which I think it is,

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the most important
part of what humans

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:53.020 align:middle line:84%
are, as I'm becoming
convinced, is our soul.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And that the soul
is not mythological.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not boxed up in
pasteurized religions.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us that
gives animus to life.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And that the story that
is unfolding right now

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.960 align:middle line:84%
as we go forward
in 2019, I think

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we have to break
open that headline,

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.840 align:middle line:84%
we are not alone
in this universe.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.260 align:middle line:90%
We never have been.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Tremendous amounts of stuff
have been there long ago, just

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:30.390 align:middle line:90%
like Michio Koku has described.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But that the irony
of all of this

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is if we are somebody
else's Androids,

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.070 align:middle line:84%
that something in
the divine field

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:84%
pulled the rug out of
the Android makers.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Homo sapiens sapien

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:84%
has a soul that may be unlike
anything else in this universe.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we knew it and
we lived it, how could

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:00.642 align:middle line:90%
we possibly kill each other?

00:57:00.642 --> 00:57:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that, Linda.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you need a tissue?

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little choked up.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Rabbi--

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot.

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was,
that was, wow.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi, based on what
Linda just stated

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and your statements about
us leaving this planet,

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:33.330 align:middle line:84%
higher civilization
millions of years ago,

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:35.840 align:middle line:84%
how do you respond to
that does this line up

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:84%
with what you have been
suggesting in the text?

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like the Bible
says, [SPEAKING HEBREW],,

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.940 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
new under the sun.

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we've
been sharing here,

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:53.753 align:middle line:84%
like I've been trying to
say, is nothing new here.

00:57:53.753 --> 00:57:55.670 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking about
all these discoveries

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.670 align:middle line:10%
with the Nazca Lines
and things like that,

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.540 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing new here.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider these to be
amazing, as many people do.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The question is why do we
consider these things wonderful

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:11.480 align:middle line:90%
or amazing or revelatory?

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is--

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and Linda understands this--

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:18.170 align:middle line:84%
it's not so much what we're
discovering as much as what

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:19.850 align:middle line:90%
we have we've been taught.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:58:21.565 --> 00:58:23.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Rabbi, I want you to expand
for the audience, though--

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:23.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Hold on one second.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.668 align:middle line:84%
Let me expand on this
for a quick second.

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Because Erich hit on this.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.680 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Erich hit on this,
right, when he

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:32.360 align:middle line:10%
was facing all
kinds of opposition

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.200 align:middle line:10%
because we have been
taught what to believe,

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:42.710 align:middle line:10%
we have been given a pattern
that this is the accepted norm.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we find so
many things which

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.660 align:middle line:84%
don't fit into that
pattern, then we

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.970 align:middle line:84%
consider them to be
wonderful, amazing, whatever.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:54.800 align:middle line:10%
Whereas the truth is these
things have been the norm

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.742 align:middle line:10%
and that which we have received
as information is a lie.

00:58:59.742 --> 00:59:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what I want
you-- thank you for that--

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and this is what I want you to--

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.990 align:middle line:84%
for the audience, and those
listening and watching

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.620 align:middle line:84%
around the world, I want them to
understand what you are talking

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.490 align:middle line:90%
about here, for clarification.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:18.210 align:middle line:84%
How long ago would
this civilization

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:22.770 align:middle line:84%
have started to advance far
enough to leave this planet?

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about us, that
is coming back and visiting.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be very
clear so they understand

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.890 align:middle line:90%
what you're trying to say.

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's be very clear.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I will speak again
from point of view

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.950 align:middle line:84%
as described in traditional
orthodox Torah Kabbalistic

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:38.980 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Not my own perspectives,
not my own interpretations.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It's been well-known, that
which we call Pre-Adamic

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:48.120 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, that
according to some

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.073 align:middle line:84%
there's been life on Earth maybe
dating back billions of years.

00:59:52.073 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:84%
We believe, of
course, that it all

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:57.330 align:middle line:84%
is by a divine design,
a divine plan of God.

00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is clearly
understood, even echoed

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.000 align:middle line:84%
within the Biblical
tradition, that one

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.740 align:middle line:84%
of the earliest civilizations
most likely on Earth

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.720 align:middle line:90%
was of a reptilian form.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.990 align:middle line:84%
We read about this
and misunderstand this

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
from the serpent in the Bible,
the story of Adam and Eve

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
in the Garden of Eden.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have from our
tradition, well known,

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that the serpent, as we
know from the Bible, spoke.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But we know that it stood
erect, had arms and legs.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was obviously
intelligent.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
If that's not a
reptilian humanoid

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
predating Adamic
civilization, well, there it

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
is, right there in the Bible.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
These things, again, are
not revelatory to us,

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that is understood that this was
just a representative of a much

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
older ancient race of beings
referred to in earlier

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
literature, a book
called Sepher Yetzirah,

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Formation,
readily available in English.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
A group called
the Teli, T-E-L-I,

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:04.550 align:middle line:90%
were referred to as the dragons.

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Curious statement
made about them.

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But they rule in the universe
like a king upon the throne.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Who are these entities?

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
We have literature
dating back literally

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years who describe
who they are, what they are.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And they are understood to be
an advanced race of dragons,

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
reptilian entities,
who, not like

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in the Western traditions
who are viewed to be evil,

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
bad, fallen angels,
and the like,

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
but rather close to God, holy.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Referenced actually to the
book of Isaiah, chapter 6,

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
where it speaks
about the Seraphim.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Most people do not understand
that word correctly.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The word Seraph
in Hebrew doesn't

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.530 align:middle line:90%
mean enlightened, burning ones.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
That would be
[? Soreph. ?] But Seraph--

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
a difference of vowels--

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
means a reptilian.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Based in the book of
Numbers, where it says Moses

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
put on the staff a serpent,
a symbol of a serpent.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a Seraph.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a race the, Seraphim
or reptilian entities.

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the
Chinese tradition

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
Judaic tradition,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we have a clear [HEBREW],,
an ancient tradition

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient race indigenous
to this Earth, most likely.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Millions of years old?

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Very possible.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in the original
Hebraic Torah Kabbalist record

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to contradict any
of these things.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.052 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we don't consider
it such a profound revelation,

01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
simply because we have
known about these things

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.140 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm not
making light of this.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being cavalier.

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear somebody
say, a witness, a contactee,

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
say-- and then I
saw the reptilians,

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
they came in my room,
we had a conversation.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
For you, your reaction
is, we've been

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:04.300 align:middle line:90%
writing about that for years.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you
Rabbi [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.873 align:middle line:84%
wrote about that in
the 14th century.

01:03:07.873 --> 01:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you
Rabbi [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
wrote about that in
the 11th century.

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you
Rabbi [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
wrote about that in
the 20th century.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these things have
been around for a while.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
because we've been

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
taught these things are not
true, these things do not

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
happen, that when people
have these experiences, then

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
it becomes this revelatory,
profound experience.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Linda and I, again, were
sharing before coming up here,

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
were sharing about
out-of-body experiences.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Out-of-body of children.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And Linda was saying how,
you know, she's had her,

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I've had mine.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And people say, wow, that's
so profound, it's so unique.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And no, it's not.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It's actually rather common.

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're
taught not to pay attention

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to these things, not to
believe in these things.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And not to talk
about them with anyone.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Because mystical experiences
in general are frowned upon.

01:04:06.747 --> 01:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
They're looked down.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not
rational, analytical,

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we
want to call them.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And as such, because
we've created

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
this little itsy, bitsy
box of what we accept

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and anything outside the box,
we don't accept or believe.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And aren't we always taught
think outside the box?

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:26.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean--

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.245 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you know how many people
are in this room right now

01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:31.040 align:middle line:10%
going, I want to hang
out with the rabbi.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to hang
out with this guy.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
One last question,
Rabbi, if you would.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
You are, like you
said, you were exposed

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to this at the age of 30,
relative newcomer in all

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
regards.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
But "Ancient Aliens "is
a worldwide phenomenon.

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
It is something that reaches out
beyond this community to people

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.110 align:middle line:90%
that are asking these questions.

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:03.290 align:middle line:90%
What does that suggest to you?

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That you don't have to be a
contactee or somebody that

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
believes in UFOs that they
are asking these questions

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that "Ancient Aliens"
is presenting.

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:18.933 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a point that I
made with the production staff

01:05:18.933 --> 01:05:21.350 align:middle line:10%
of Prometheus Entertainment,
who makes the "Ancient Alien"

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:21.860 align:middle line:10%
program.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
When we had our first
conference in Santa Clarita,

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.347 align:middle line:84%
we had, oh, gosh, what
was it, 10, 15,000 people.

01:05:27.347 --> 01:05:28.430 align:middle line:90%
But Linda, you were there.

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.080 align:middle line:10%
Jason, you were there.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Amazing following there.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I turned to Kevin Burns,
and I said, Kevin,

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
this is not people coming here
to meet their favorite stars.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a star.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
These are people who are coming,
like people are coming here.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%
They have questions.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.320 align:middle line:90%
They're pursuers.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.580 align:middle line:90%
They want to know.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, Kevin, you've
created a phenomenon.

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's part and parcel
of a growing evolution

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
which, if you want

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to speak about it from a
religious point of view,

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
call it pre Messianic
revelations, the coming

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Messiah, whatever
our traditions might

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
be on that, the dawning of a
new age, the Age of Aquarius,

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Truth is coming out.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Erich is part of that.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Somehow-- and this is something
I shared with Erich before--

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
somehow, somewhere,
some thing or someone ,

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
or somehow put the idea in
his head all those years ago,

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:27.365 align:middle line:90%
think about these things.

01:06:27.365 --> 01:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Write this book.

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Put it together.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:30.830 align:middle line:10%
Right?

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Erich can say,
after the fact, oh, yeah,

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I sat down 50 years ago
and I knew all of this

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.230 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't think like that.

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:44.600 align:middle line:10%
But somehow, somewhere
whatever powers that be, did.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.510 align:middle line:10%
And Erich became that conduit.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:51.320 align:middle line:10%
And here we are each now
as individual conduits

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.858 align:middle line:10%
in our own way,
participating, contributing

01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:57.150 align:middle line:10%
to the greater whole of things.

01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And Linda, in my
opinion, said it

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
very accurately about
what we call, if you will,

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.550 align:middle line:90%
the holiness of souls.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.130 align:middle line:10%
The concept of the
evolution that we're all,

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.200 align:middle line:10%
if you will, like
Master Yoda said,

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.900 align:middle line:10%
luminescent beings,
not this crude matter.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if this is
a laboratory or an experiment

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.910 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't have access
to that kind of information.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But what it is is that
we are evolving entities.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:26.310 align:middle line:90%
We're growing in awareness.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's happening.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this is
all part and parcel

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
of whatever was then, with
whoever they were, whether it

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
be the Tile or pre-Adamics
or whatever, we're becoming,

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.467 align:middle line:90%
we're maturing.

01:07:41.467 --> 01:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Like Arthur C. Clarke would
have said in his book,

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.560 align:middle line:90%
this is childhood's end.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.470 align:middle line:10%
And whether the planet
is going to evolve

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.660 align:middle line:10%
into a different
dimension or whatever,

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:55.130 align:middle line:10%
but we're at that
place right now.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And this conference is
part and parcel of it.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a rock star.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.810 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Rock star.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson, staying on
the same subject-- and I'm

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
going to come this way--
staying on the same subject.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Forbidden knowledge.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
what you're about.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And you literally have millions
of followers on social media,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:24.109 align:middle line:84%
following something called
4biddenknowledge, right?

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.955 align:middle line:84%
How hungry is the
world for this?

01:08:26.955 --> 01:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And what does "Ancient Aliens"
and "Chariots of the Gods"

01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:30.770 align:middle line:90%
play into?

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I started
this a very long time ago,

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
in terms of spreading
knowledge and information.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:41.689 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started, it was
just through private meetings

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:44.090 align:middle line:90%
with a small group of people.

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't
talk about aliens

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and ancient civilizations
and UFOs out in the open,

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.359 align:middle line:84%
because you'd be considered
a freak or a crazy person

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.680 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I saw it
go from private meetings

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to exchanging
conspiracies on VHS tapes

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
to then exchanging
information on CDs, then DVDs.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.649 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you know,
mainstream cable, and now

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:11.180 align:middle line:90%
streaming networks.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen the evolution of
the growth of consciousness

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.705 align:middle line:84%
and the acceptance of this
information, which shouldn't

01:09:18.705 --> 01:09:19.830 align:middle line:90%
be alternative information.

01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
It should be the
standard information.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But we're calling it alternative
for now, as we grow into it.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen this evolution
occur in consciousness going

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
all the way back from
the 1980s all the way

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.859 align:middle line:90%
till now, 2019, going into 2020.

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I can just see through
even with my own stuff,

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
through the internet with
forums and websites and blogs

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and now social media,
it's just incredible.

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:48.979 align:middle line:84%
And so now you'll go
out to restaurants

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and you'll hear
people in the table

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
behind you talking about
aliens or UFOs or conspiracies

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
or crystals or spirituality,
getting away from rel--

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
all these different
types of things,

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
just you can hear the
consciousness evolving

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:03.950 align:middle line:90%
through the people.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just really excited.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.480 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
time to be alive.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
be a part of this.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
one of the pioneers

01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of this whole movement,
even though know

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Erich Von Daniken is one of
the, like the great grandfather

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.790 align:middle line:90%
of the movement, so to speak.

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I really feel
like that information

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:26.838 align:middle line:84%
kickstarted so many people
and got the wheels turning.

01:10:26.838 --> 01:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows somebody
that you don't know.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.877 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, that information
ended up getting to me.

01:10:31.877 --> 01:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I was able to
take that information

01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:35.313 align:middle line:90%
and turn me into a researcher.

01:10:35.313 --> 01:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
I was able to begin

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
to spread that information.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's just spreading
like that exponentially.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
that through the movement

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.043 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, our solar
system through the galaxy,

01:10:50.043 --> 01:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
cosmic rays that we're

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
absorbing, especially
since we passed

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
through that galactic
equator back in 2012,

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and now we're headed into
the Age of Aquarius by 2025,

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe
that a lot of those,

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the different gravitational
pulls, cosmic rays

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
all have a direct effect on
human consciousness and DNA.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I really do
believe that that also

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
is part and parcel, a little
bit of the cause for some

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of this evolution
of consciousness,

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and also the amount of people
that are now automatically

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
starting to wake up and want
to know more information,

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
starting to ask questions
that they never asked before,

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
starting to look at
alternative news and things

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
like that, to try to
get more information.

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're on a great path.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.270 align:middle line:10%
And I really think that our
future is very, very bright.

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:40.040 align:middle line:10%
And we're probably ushering the
human race into the Silver Age

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.890 align:middle line:10%
and then, eventually,
into the Golden.

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if we can get
some stem cells going,

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.552 align:middle line:90%
I can make it to the Golden Age.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:47.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the audience probably
doesn't know what I'm about

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to say about you.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But Billy also has
his own record label.

01:11:56.630 --> 01:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And about six months
ago, one of his artists

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
charted on Billboard,
four charts, four?

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Four charts for--

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Four charts, charted, and
with songs like "Anunnaki."

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
comment briefly

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
on that, where you are obviously
putting your money where

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
your mouth is when it comes
to this, and 4biddenknowledge,

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to go into the hip hop
community like that

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:32.725 align:middle line:84%
and have an extremely
successful album.

01:12:32.725 --> 01:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this on
"Coast" and "Fade to Black."

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote a song
called "Fade to Black"

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.900 align:middle line:90%
that was released as a single.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And you fully accept what social
media, other forms of media

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.350 align:middle line:90%
will do to spread the message.

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
commend you for that.

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I want your comments.

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah I started a label called
Pantheon Elite Records.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And the whole concept behind
it was I was looking for a way

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to spread more information
to more people through music.

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Because music is
the biggest medium

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
or source to send
information out in the world.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing bigger,
I think, than music.

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I figured if I can tap
into the younger crowd who

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:14.885 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know who
4biddenknowledge

01:13:14.885 --> 01:13:15.848 align:middle line:90%
is, who's Billy Carson?

01:13:15.848 --> 01:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't know who I am.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm just this old guy up here.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So I said, if I can get the
beats that the kids love,

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, because everybody
hears the beat first

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.590 align:middle line:90%
before they know the words.

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You never know the
words instantaneously.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.592 align:middle line:90%
You always hear the beat first.

01:13:28.592 --> 01:13:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So I said, if I can get
the beats down and then

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
lace those beats with
verses that have information

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness, about
chakras, about ancient history,

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
about conspiracies and all
these different types of things,

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:45.385 align:middle line:84%
then eventually they'll
start to learn the words.

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they start
learning the words,

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say, well,
what am I talking about?

01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
What is it an Anunnaki.

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
What is a false flag?

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And what do-- you know, and then
they're going to go on Google.

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

01:13:57.370 --> 01:13:59.145 align:middle line:84%
So I started creating
all of these researchers.

01:13:59.145 --> 01:13:59.490 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> How great is that?

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:05.370 align:middle line:90%


01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was an incredible
vision that I received that I

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.670 align:middle line:90%
downloaded from the universe.

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:15.275 align:middle line:84%
And it came into me, and I've I
started looking for an artist.

01:14:15.275 --> 01:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I found a phenomenal
artist named Donny Arcade,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and me and him partnered up.

01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And since then, we've brought
a couple more artists on.

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And we've done phenomenal.

01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, we
charted on Billboard

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
with songs like
"Anunnaki" and "Words

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
From My Subconscious,"
which talks about how

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.180 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious works.

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
"Seven Chakras."

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So we explain the seven
chakras in a rap song

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and how the chakra system works.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> This is no joke, by the way.

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:38.840 align:middle line:90%
This is no joke.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --to the [INAUDIBLE] realm.

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And crystal technology, we go--

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.340 align:middle line:90%
metaphysics.

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
We talk about so many
different-- of course,

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.450 align:middle line:90%
and ancient history.

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The videos are
incredible, too.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a very
big success and we're

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
looking forward to
growing and continuing

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to put out more information
and more knowledge and more

01:14:58.930 --> 01:14:59.730 align:middle line:90%
new tracks.

01:14:59.730 --> 01:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're going down
the street and you see a couple

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
kids, [IMITATING HIP HOP]
"Anunnaki," you know what's up.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.160 align:middle line:90%
They may not know what's up.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to go
home and Google it, right?

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.480 align:middle line:10%
>> They're going to
go home and Google it.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
They always do.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been
on radio shows.

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.573 align:middle line:84%
And even the radio
hosts will be like,

01:15:16.573 --> 01:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
man, we've been
playing this song.

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.365 align:middle line:84%
We've been getting
a lot of calls

01:15:19.365 --> 01:15:21.360 align:middle line:90%
to play it over and over again.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.205 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just gotta ask you,
man, what is this Anunnaki?

01:15:26.205 --> 01:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I just gotta
hear it from you.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
went on Google, it

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.290 align:middle line:90%
talked about reptilian aliens.

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:34.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.940 align:middle line:90%


01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.800 align:middle line:10%
>> So yeah, it's amazing.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing to see that
development of consciousness

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and people actually
accepting this music

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and playing it millions
and millions of times.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was
I said, OK, how

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
can I get this music out without
spending millions of dollars,

01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%
like mainstream record label?

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So I already had the platform,
through 4biddenknowledge,

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
putting out content
that would go viral.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Every day I probably
make three or four posts

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that go viral that day.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.258 align:middle line:84%
I mean 200, 300, 400,000 views,
sometimes millions in a day.

01:16:06.258 --> 01:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going
to start putting

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.480 align:middle line:90%
the music behind the content.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.405 align:middle line:84%
So I make videos
that show, depict

01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
information about, whether it's
ancient history or conspiracies

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
or medicine or technology,
and I will put the music

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
playing in the background, and
then watch the post go viral.

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would see a post go
viral, 2, 3 million views.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
The song gets played 2, 3
million times in a few days.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
The next thing
you know, it's got

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:31.410 align:middle line:84%
10,000 downloads
or 20,000 streams

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.360 align:middle line:90%
on Apple Music or whatever.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.355 align:middle line:84%
And you go in the
backdoor that way.

01:16:35.355 --> 01:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know how
to play in the matrix.

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for that, Billy.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.885 align:middle line:90%
It's so impressive.

01:16:39.885 --> 01:16:42.400 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember when the album
charted, you and I are friends

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and we were somewhere traveling
together, and I get back to LA.

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And I contact Donny to
bring him on "Coast."

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so good about it.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
thing you have to do.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to trust, but verify.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do, right?

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So I jump on it and I
look up Billboard charts.

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Donny Arcade, right
there, "Anunnaki,"

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
chart number two,
chart number three,

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:19.920 align:middle line:84%
live, and I just, I was so proud
of what you guys put together.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.957 align:middle line:84%
And just to see "Anunnaki"
charting on Billboard.

01:17:24.957 --> 01:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that, Billy.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Just incredible,
incredible, incredible.

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Jason, do you have
"Anunnaki" on your phone?

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Have you been spinning that?

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> No, unfortunately, I do not.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Never heard the song, but I
will have to check that out.

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty amazing.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Jason, you're a tech guy.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.800 align:middle line:90%
You're a startup guy.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this little side
gig called "Ancient Aliens"

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:55.290 align:middle line:90%
in this other life.

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:58.500 align:middle line:10%
I just have to ask, for
everybody in this room,

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:06.328 align:middle line:10%
do the people that you work
with know about your other life?

01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, do they come in
and go, dude, I saw you

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
on "Ancient Aliens" last night?

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Or are they paying attention?

01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Or do they ask questions?

01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:14.952 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have a line
drawn in the sand?

01:18:14.952 --> 01:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I've kind of always kept
a line drawn in the sand.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Over the last,
let's say, 10 years

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of my professional,
how I make money

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
versus doing the research.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But as several other colleagues
have pointed out here,

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
the climate has been changing.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very gratifying that
it's moved from small groups

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to appropriate things
like this, where, yeah, it

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit more mainstream
now, in that I don't have

01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to be as worried about
my professional career

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
intermingling into my
hobby, because it's reached

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
a new plateau, where it's like,
oh, "Ancient Aliens," man,

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.632 align:middle line:90%
that stuff's cool.

01:18:49.632 --> 01:18:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't always
been that way.

01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It was very much
like a dark topic

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that, as Billy pointed out,
you couldn't articulate it

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in the right way or else
you'd come across weird.

01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:02.260 align:middle line:90%
So that climate has changed.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful for that.

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, there's
surface topics, like aliens

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.522 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs and Anunnaki.

01:19:09.522 --> 01:19:11.730 align:middle line:10%
But as you hear from some
of these other researchers,

01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:13.980 align:middle line:10%
like Ariel and such,
there are deeper topics

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.200 align:middle line:10%
that we're all aware of.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're really,
really trying to get

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of
these answers, meaning

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
all the great ancient
cultures that we know of,

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.358 align:middle line:84%
they all speak of and have been
influenced by some lost race.

01:19:27.358 --> 01:19:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know who they are.

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.390 align:middle line:90%
We could call them gods.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You could call them some
pre-Adamic population.

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Atlanteans, that's too corny.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, there are
civilizations [INAUDIBLE],,

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
[? Gobekli ?] [? Tepe, ?]
and the Mayans and the Hindus

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Sumerian, all of them
have been influenced by some

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
lost race that was globally
going around and teaching this

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.460 align:middle line:10%
That's some really
interesting stuff

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.370 align:middle line:10%
is trying to unlock these doors
beyond the recorded history

01:19:56.370 --> 01:20:00.130 align:middle line:10%
books of today and bring
out new information.

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
really get jazzed

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is the history isn't linear that
shows where people in the past

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
were dumb and we're
getting smarter.

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
No, the further back you go,
you find much more brilliance

01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.270 align:middle line:90%
in architecture and mathematics.

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Because more than likely,
there is a cyclical process.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We've heard of the Dark
Ages, the Golden Age,

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.420 align:middle line:90%
you hear these terms.

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But there are over 30 ancient
cultures that used astronomy

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.850 align:middle line:90%
as a guide for time.

01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we hear terms like
procession and things

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
like that that today
we don't understand.

01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
If I asked the audience
who understands procession,

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.380 align:middle line:90%
you might see one or two hands.

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But these are leading
scientific terms

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that the people up
here, and through shows

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
like "Ancient Aliens,"
are pushing the mainstream

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
science forward and teaching
them what the real truth is.

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I am very
grateful to be a part of.

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Just-- thank you
for that, Jason.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, it was
last year, but Jason

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
invites Rita and I down to
his house for a cookout.

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And OK, so we go down.

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
What he doesn't tell me is
the other guest at the house

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.190 align:middle line:90%
were his co-workers.

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm odd man out, man.

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not I'm not a techie.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a brainiac.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.430 align:middle line:90%
But we had a lot of fun.

01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Jason introduces
me to everybody like this.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
He goes, oh, by
the way, everybody,

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy's on the radio
talking about UFOs.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.940 align:middle line:90%
That's his gig.

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Am I stretching the truth?

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Dude, you were the
most popular person that--

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They would not stop
talking UFOs all afternoon.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It was like they were free.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
They're out of the closet.

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:49.080 align:middle line:10%
They were able to talk
about these things

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.230 align:middle line:10%
with somebody that was
not going to ridicule.

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And they had questions, Jason.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.470 align:middle line:90%
They had questions for you, too.

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't know
a whole lot about what

01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
was really going on.

01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You brought up a
lot of interesting,

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
eye opener points
there that, again,

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
mainstream people
aren't usually aware of.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you hear it in the
right emotional context,

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
a little light should go off
and allow you to question

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
whether you believe it or not.

01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Go to Google and
start looking around.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It was so much
fun to go through.

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And you threw me under the bus.

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But what it showed me was
that it doesn't matter,

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
when you're walking
down the street

01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're passing
somebody, don't judge.

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they have the same
questions that you do.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.660 align:middle line:90%
They may not show it.

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They may not walk around
with one of these pins on.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.260 align:middle line:90%
I was abducted UFO t-shirt.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.100 align:middle line:90%
They may not do that.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But they have the same
questions that all of us do.

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazing afternoon.

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Very eye opening for me.

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Linda, I want to go
straight back to you,

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
4biddenknowledge side of all

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of this.

01:22:57.410 --> 01:23:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It is, it's truly forbidden.

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.340 align:middle line:10%
It was such a taboo
subject for so many years.

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Today, because of the
efforts of yourself

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and Erich, where we can actually
go and speak about this, like I

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
did at Jason's house, and
Billy releasing albums,

01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
the rabbi on "Ancient Alien"
speaking about ancient Hebrew

01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:23.630 align:middle line:84%
text, where for all of this now,
are we at a point in society,

01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:25.180 align:middle line:90%
is disclosure close?

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Are we able to talk about
this stuff comfortably?

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:32.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, tell you a signal is
coming from Harvard University.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The chair of the astronomy
department is Avi Loeb.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> He's amazing.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And he emails
me all the time,

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
as well as his colleagues, as he
keeps putting out more and more

01:23:45.710 --> 01:23:46.510 align:middle line:90%
papers.

01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And the one subject
that Avi Loeb--

01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
he is the chairman of the
Department of Astronomy

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.880 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard University--

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
he is on the board
for Star Shot.

01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
He is involved with
major issues having

01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to do with all things related
to us getting off the planet,

01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
going to Mars, getting
out into the system.

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I'm coming to
is that he has, for now--

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
because I've interviewed him
three times about 'Oumuamua.

01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
That was that long flat
thing that came through.

01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And it is defined as the
very first interstellar--

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would say
that the human mind, it's

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the first time ever in human
history that leaders in science

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
said, this is from X
and it's interstellar.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's never been here before.

01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, within nine months
of its appearance--

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and all of-- you
may not know this,

01:24:56.910 --> 01:25:01.400 align:middle line:90%
this is one piece to remember--

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
this object that was like
a ratio of 200 feet long

01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and something like
40, 50 feet wide--

01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:15.680 align:middle line:90%
it's very long and thin--

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that when they were
doing calculations,

01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
it came toward the sun, then it
did a hairpin turn, literally

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
like this, you can
see the animation

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
of all the astronomers who
studied this and were amazed.

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And when it came around on this
other side of the hairpin turn,

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
after it came from the sun, it
was headed toward the earth.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It took off.

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It was going 57,000
miles an hour.

01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It increased in speed.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is
what I'm coming to.

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It's 57,000 miles an hour.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't have to jump.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes around
this side of the hairpin,

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and it went up to
96,000 miles an hour.

01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And there was not one
possible signature

01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that there was any ice, not
a comet, wasn't gassing.

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
How could it go from 57,000
to 96,000 miles an hour?

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And then Avi Loeb
started writing papers

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
saying that his hypothesis was
that this is an ancient craft

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.160 align:middle line:90%
and still operating.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
This is from the chairman
of the Astronomy Department

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.000 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> He will not let his
foot off the gas on this.

01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:37.810 align:middle line:90%
He is steadfast.

01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, he sent me at least a
dozen papers just in the last

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.870 align:middle line:90%
year.

01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:45.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely incredible.

01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:46.420 align:middle line:90%
So what does that say to you?

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting
close to something?

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
When he-- you know, last
week, the latest press

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.650 align:middle line:84%
release from him
and his statements,

01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure that
you heard from him,

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I did, that he's talking
about the possibility

01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:00.790 align:middle line:90%
of a solar sail.

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And that this is a
very thin structure

01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that is wrapped up, but
that's what is going on here.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, he won't
give up on this.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.010 align:middle line:84%
He's got a lot of pressure to
change his mind, but he's not.

01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.810 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:16.570 align:middle line:10%
I wanted everybody's
minds to be blown tomorrow

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:18.198 align:middle line:10%
when you get to hear--

01:27:18.198 --> 01:27:19.740 align:middle line:10%
>> No, what about
tonight, right now?

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
It's an answer to your question.

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
The Navy SEAL speaks
from information

01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
on the eighth floor of the
National Security Agency

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:middle line:90%
about 'Oumuamua.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the NSA says it's a derelict
spacecraft that has come

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
from the constellation Lyra.

01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what
I'm talking about.

01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And no, I'm not kidding.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Why are we as a planet not
being told this information?

01:27:55.130 --> 01:28:00.280 align:middle line:10%
How in the hell have we ended
up on a concocted planet where

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.570 align:middle line:10%
only a handful of
people have the right

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:06.880 align:middle line:10%
to even know that something
that comes through

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.910 align:middle line:10%
that is the first
interstellar object,

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:14.140 align:middle line:10%
and that the head of Harvard
and SEALs and everybody else

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.610 align:middle line:10%
knows that it is some
form of spacecraft?

01:28:18.610 --> 01:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of us
are told, go away.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Linda for President, 2020.

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE] Right there.

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll take it.

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
I will open this up.

01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Erich, disclosure.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Is that a word that
you're concerned with?

01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely agree with her.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Why are these things
not coming to public?

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.530 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with our media?

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.600 align:middle line:84%
As you're president,
I'm sorry, I'm just

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
a visitor from Switzerland,
as your president says,

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot of fake
news here is going on.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.960 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no fake news
in Switzerland, Erich.

01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course there--

01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.270 align:middle line:90%
the world is full of fake news.

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] I just saw
a video from a president

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
from a Russian republic,
I don't forget his name.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I forgot his name.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Because a complicated
Russian name.

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The president of a republic
in Russia, before the camera,

01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
he said he was abducted
by extraterrestrials.

01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:29:24.786 --> 01:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then in the
original Russian interview,

01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I saw the original
with translation,

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the interviewer asked the
president, said, but Mr.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
President, do you know you will
be ridiculed because of this?

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
He said, yes, I know
I will be ridiculed.

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Why do you go to
public and say it?

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the extraterrestrials
asked me to go to public.

01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So they want that the
situation changes.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are talking
about the rabbi talking about

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
[? ages ?] and maybe
ideas coming from outside.

01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, when
I write my books,

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I write it in my
mother language,

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:02.880 align:middle line:90%
which is German language.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Then some of these
books are translated.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And from time to time, I have
to read the translations,

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
French translation,

01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I speak fluidly French,
simply to control

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.420 align:middle line:90%
if the translation is correct.

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I read my
own books, which

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I have written two years
before, and I wondering myself,

01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Erich, how do you
get to this idea?

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.547 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

01:30:25.547 --> 01:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And the information
is always correct.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there is something
like an influence.

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
We are never sure.

01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And concerning some
datings, I just remembered,

01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
so 2,500 years ago, the
Greek historian Herodotus,

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
maybe you heard in school
from him, Herodotus,

01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:42.700 align:middle line:90%
he was in Egypt.

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It was 450 BC in Egypt,
2,500 years from now.

01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was living in
Egypt in today's Luxor.

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the name was
[? Tabon. ?] And he writes

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
in the second book of history,
he writes that the priests

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of [? Tabon ?] showed
him, Herodotus,

01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
241 statues made out
of stone and wood.

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest gave to
every statue an explanation.

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:11.820 align:middle line:90%
That was his name.

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.680 align:middle line:84%
He was leading from
then to then, and so on.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
248 statues.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
road, the high priest

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.060 align:middle line:90%
said, these 248 statues--

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
41 statues-- represent
11,340 years.

01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:30.060 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the gods
from the firmament

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.260 align:middle line:90%
were among the humans.

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, they
have not returned.

01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Now 11,340 years.

01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But Herodotus made
these statements

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years from now.

01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have to add the
2,500 years from now to

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.030 align:middle line:84%
[? Herodot. ?] Roughly
14,000 years ago,

01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
according to Herodotus,
the gods from outer space

01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:52.320 align:middle line:90%
were among the humans.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We never hear about
this information.

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But you can read it in
the book of [? Herodot, ?]

01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%
the second book of history.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You never hear something.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it
contradicts evolution.

01:32:01.890 --> 01:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Accordingly to Egyptology
that the history of Egypt

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
starts roughly 3000 BC,
but never 14,000 BC.

01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Gobekli Tepe is--

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Gobekli Tepe.

01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It's 12,000 years old.

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:23.770 align:middle line:10%
And that is clearly
something truly bizarre.

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I have stood
there in the middle of it.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And anywhere else I've
been on the planet,

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I could sort of feel
the gestalt of it.

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in the
center of Gobekli Tepe,

01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
what hits you is
this is totally un--

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.900 align:middle line:90%
you can't feel it.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't understand
what you're in.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
You are looking at creatures
that are three dimensionally,

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
it's like you took limestone
that weighed 15 tons

01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%
and you did an intricate animal.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not glued on.

01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Somebody had the ability to do--

01:32:58.410 --> 01:32:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You had to plan that.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh.

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And then you realize
that you can't

01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:06.210 align:middle line:10%
get a feel for what it is.

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:12.570 align:middle line:10%
What is this place with 300
and some huge pillars in rings?

01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And the first morning that we
were there, on June 13, 2012,

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:21.710 align:middle line:10%
we were deliberately waiting
for the sun to come up.

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:24.200 align:middle line:10%
And I was standing--
it's in a bowl.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.220 align:middle line:10%
So when you're up
here, Gobekli Tepe

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.780 align:middle line:10%
is actually down like this.

01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
the archeology is.

01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:36.200 align:middle line:10%
And I was just so
curious whether, when

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.120 align:middle line:10%
the first rays of the sun, June
13th was close to the solstice,

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:45.710 align:middle line:10%
would any of those rays
penetrate down into this bowl?

01:33:45.710 --> 01:33:48.310 align:middle line:10%
And two things did.

01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:51.690 align:middle line:10%
And I did this 180 degree
turn and could see,

01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:54.390 align:middle line:10%
and so I started
walking down to them.

01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:56.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I had this
feeling that I'd never

01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:01.460 align:middle line:10%
been any place on
Earth, ever, that

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:05.610 align:middle line:10%
was that weird, that was that
foreign, that was nothing.

01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:08.060 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't feel anything.

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:11.270 align:middle line:10%
And Shock, Robert
Shock, the geologist,

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:17.310 align:middle line:10%
he got his PhD at Yale, he
knows quite a bit about geology.

01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:20.420 align:middle line:84%
He came down and he's
standing next to me.

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
I've been looking

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:28.340 align:middle line:84%
at the top of all these
T-shaped limestone pillars.

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the only thing
that I can get from this place

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.790 align:middle line:90%
is these are like tuning forks.

01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and what
if this whole place was

01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
made to have something come from
above and vibrate a frequency

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.280 align:middle line:90%
to do X?

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And he meant UFOs.

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:49.790 align:middle line:10%
>> May I [? chance ?]
a remark here?

01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:50.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe is a place--

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Say it again.

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:54.995 align:middle line:90%
How did you say it?

01:34:54.995 --> 01:34:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Gobekli Tepe, in German.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been saying it
wrong this whole time.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Abraham, you know
the biblical Abraham,

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
was living just, he was born
just 60 kilometers away from

01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe.

01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows this.

01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham, there is one
of the Dead Sea Scrolls

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.860 align:middle line:90%
is the Abraham Scroll.

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
There, in the first
person, he says,

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:20.870 align:middle line:84%
it was evening when he
heard a noise in the space.

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Just near to today's Gobeli--

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.890 align:middle line:90%
hear the noise in this space.

01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
a light came down.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And then two beings looking like
human, but different to human

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.490 align:middle line:84%
because they did not
breathe like humans.

01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They had something
before [INAUDIBLE]..

01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Abraham [INAUDIBLE] in
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, I never saw
beings like these on Earth.

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
These two beings, they take
him, Abraham, up into the sky.

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:48.860 align:middle line:90%
He goes up.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.570 align:middle line:90%
He flies over the earth.

01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:55.480 align:middle line:84%
He's up there, he says, I wish
to fall downward to the earth.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says, I
wish to fall downward,

01:35:57.230 --> 01:35:58.370 align:middle line:90%
he's not on the earth.

01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And he described the
round, circle of the Earth.

01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Only the Abraham
[? apocrypha, ?] just

01:36:04.570 --> 01:36:05.900 align:middle line:90%
near to Gobekli Tepe.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is a link
together [INAUDIBLE]..

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've got to learn
how to say it like you.

01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:11.420 align:middle line:10%
That's incredible.

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The Turks say, Gobekli Tepe.

01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:18.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're there, the
Turks say Gobekli Tepe.

01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> They need to listen to
some of my commercials.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.662 align:middle line:90%
You guys get it, don't you?

01:36:22.662 --> 01:36:23.870 align:middle line:90%
You guys get the humor there.

01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It means Potbelly Hill.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It does.

01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Erich, I have to ask you
something very serious

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
here about Gobekli
Tepe, which is this.

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:39.470 align:middle line:84%
When it was discovered,
1995, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
when it was discovered,
were you expecting it?

01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> 1994.

01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>> '94.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Were you were you expecting it?

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Were you anxious to say this
is what I've been on about?

01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the opportunity
to do that, doesn't it?

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very surprised
about that finding.

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I was very curious.

01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I was personally,
personally never there.

01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:02.810 align:middle line:10%
In my books, I only
write about things

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:05.960 align:middle line:10%
which I know in person, which
I touch, which I smelled,

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.250 align:middle line:10%
which I know the history.

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I, until today, I was never,
never there in person.

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
have never published

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.180 align:middle line:90%
something about [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But there is another place in
Indonesia called [INAUDIBLE]..

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's even older
than [INAUDIBLE]..

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> 26,000.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, some 22,000.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.680 align:middle line:10%
I was there.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So all this story of evolution
just crashed down, forget it.

01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead, Linda.

01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:33.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, yeah, let me
share just one thing.

01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:38.420 align:middle line:10%
That when you go to the
museum that is in Sanlurfa,

01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.140 align:middle line:10%
about maybe three or
four miles from the site,

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.800 align:middle line:10%
they have been taking
the most valuable pieces

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.470 align:middle line:10%
that they have been digging
and getting the dirt away.

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Because people started stealing.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It was an open
archaeological site.

01:37:57.110 --> 01:37:59.690 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing around
it when we were there.

01:37:59.690 --> 01:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, people
were coming and stealing

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.610 align:middle line:90%
things that were archeological.

01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So they did a deal with
the Sanlurfa museum.

01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And the day we went in there,
as a journalist I have always

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:17.100 align:middle line:84%
had this thing about
going with my camera

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.195 align:middle line:84%
when I don't know
anything, I don't

01:38:19.195 --> 01:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
know where I'm going, I
don't know what I'm seeing,

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and taking photos as I go.

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I found it to be
really valuable in my work.

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So I came into the
museum with that,

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:33.350 align:middle line:84%
doing this, taking photos,
as I was moving around

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
at different things and
getting teeny bits of lecture.

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
room in the back.

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I am approaching--

01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I've never been there,
there's nobody around me,

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm just taking pictures.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And I see something that's
about six, seven feet tall.

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm working my way toward
it, wondering what is this?

01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And I come in from the side.

01:39:01.850 --> 01:39:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like something
six or seven feet tall,

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
sort of a reddish stone,
that looked like it had

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.810 align:middle line:90%
serpents going down the side.

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I come around
now to the front.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is my very first
encounter from the front.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And the snakes are knees.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Imagine.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the top,
once upon a time,

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:32.520 align:middle line:84%
there was something
up here, a face.

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And something had obliterated
the face, even carved it in.

01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
next creature here.

01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:41.160 align:middle line:90%
They're not human.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a creature.

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And it has knees.

01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of what looks
like snakes from the side.

01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
head and another body

01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and more knees.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you suggesting?

01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:57.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to picture this.

01:39:57.150 --> 01:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, you come
down to the bottom,

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and there is what looks like
a human baby being born from

01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:15.790 align:middle line:84%
a pubis of these
creatures that rise.

01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood there in a
state of absolute shock,

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:23.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking of these briefing
papers that I have been shown,

01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:26.350 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
biological energies,

01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:30.730 align:middle line:84%
manipulated DNA, and
already evolving primates

01:40:30.730 --> 01:40:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to create Homo sapien,
that is exactly what

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the statue at [INAUDIBLE],,
now in the museum, looks like.

01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Creatures that give birth at
the bottom to a human infant.

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's 12,000 years old.

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> You were standing in shock.

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm standing in shock right now.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.415 align:middle line:84%
In Urfa, Urfa man, one of the
most famous statues, right?

01:40:55.415 --> 01:40:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he's amazing.

01:40:56.290 --> 01:41:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --where you're talking about
something that is potentially

01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.100 align:middle line:84%
15,000 years old,
right, very old.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's 12,000, according
to the German archaeologist.

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.260 align:middle line:10%
>> So give or take 3,000
years, among friends.

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm suggesting here
is there's a lot of effort

01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:16.870 align:middle line:90%
that goes into that.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
primitive Stone Age, pre Stone

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Age man.

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:27.220 align:middle line:84%
To have the artistic
vision to carve that statue

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.010 align:middle line:84%
takes a lot of time, a lot of
resources, a lot of commitment,

01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
when you can be out
looking for food,

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:34.900 align:middle line:84%
protecting, trying
to survive the night.

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:35.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
But they made a mistake.

01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Six fingers.

01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.830 align:middle line:10%
Do you understand--

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:43.247 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as you're
standing there,

01:41:43.247 --> 01:41:45.892 align:middle line:10%
I'm the one who raised
that originally on "Coast"

01:41:45.892 --> 01:41:47.350 align:middle line:10%
and other things,
having come back.

01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:49.810 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you make a mistake
of six fingers when you are

01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:51.040 align:middle line:10%
carving a statue?

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:51.880 align:middle line:90%
I ask you.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue is, as we were
standing there in the museum,

01:41:57.150 --> 01:42:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the Urfa man is holding,
you assume, the penis erect.

01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, there's families here.

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> He might be holding two.

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:09.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's a whole nother--

01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:13.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And there are five
fingers on the outside.

01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And you assume that
there is another.

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep it clean, right.

01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's implied.

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And that would be six.

01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be six.

01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And two other things.

01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:27.442 align:middle line:90%
>> The testicles are there.

01:42:27.442 --> 01:42:30.886 align:middle line:90%


01:42:30.886 --> 01:42:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>> It's hot in here.

01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:32.950 align:middle line:90%
It's hot.

01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's hot.

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Hot.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they are there.

01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> As we start to wind down this
evening, has this been amazing?

01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys learned
something tonight?

01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:49.280 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
actually do this.

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Erich, 50 years, you
brought us all together.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.560 align:middle line:90%
You have changed lives.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
You've changed the world.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to stop.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You've started something
that is just now,

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.310 align:middle line:90%
it's a train running downhill.

01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The snowball is going
to continue to grow.

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I thank you for all of that.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
like to do, is I

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.370 align:middle line:84%
would like to start with
the rabbi down on the end.

01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to
have an opportunity

01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to not only thank
you, but let you know

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.840 align:middle line:90%
why they appreciate your work.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:27.950 align:middle line:10%
Rabbi, I would like for
you to take a moment.

01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:31.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Why I appreciate
Erich's work?

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that the question?

01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I think I've already
answered the question.

01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:38.140 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, it's part
and parcel of something

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.220 align:middle line:10%
that's happening.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.020 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, the
point that I want

01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize is that we
often mistakenly believe

01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that, in quote,
revelation or insights

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
have to come from spiritual
religious figures.

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
That's just not the
way reality works.

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.020 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, I think
what Erich has done

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.340 align:middle line:10%
has made a very, very
important contribution

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.370 align:middle line:10%
to what's going on.

01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:08.440 align:middle line:10%
It's influenced, obviously,
everyone here on this panel

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.160 align:middle line:10%
to make their own discoveries,
their own investigations,

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.770 align:middle line:10%
the information of which
they share with others.

01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:18.470 align:middle line:10%
And like dominoes, one
thing leads to another.

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a process,
a never ending story.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And we're in the middle of it.

01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me jump in on that point.

01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Once these dominoes do start
to fall, there is no stopping,

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.240 align:middle line:90%
is there?

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think
that they ever stop.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
You see, I don't
believe that we're

01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
in a process where
something just began, we're

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.030 align:middle line:90%
in the middle, and then it ends.

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think we're in a
continuing cycle of revelation.

01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:50.380 align:middle line:84%
There's, like it says, again,
nothing new under the sun.

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
We're a continuing
process of growth,

01:44:54.850 --> 01:44:58.930 align:middle line:84%
call it evolution, if you
will, spiritual revelation,

01:44:58.930 --> 01:45:03.190 align:middle line:84%
all the different terms to
describe the same effect.

01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:05.350 align:middle line:90%
And we're all part of that.

01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us is part of it.

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that is where
we have to recognize,

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.110 align:middle line:84%
like Linda was talking about
the importance of souls.

01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're all part
of a greater whole.

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And that when we recognize
as individuals are part,

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.200 align:middle line:10%
then we recognize our own self
value, our own self-worth,

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.360 align:middle line:10%
and then where we fit into
the greater scheme of things,

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.480 align:middle line:10%
till ultimately and eventually
we realize that we all are one.

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.670 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly what the
Biblical message was right

01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:40.480 align:middle line:10%
in the beginning, when it
says, God created all humanity

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.310 align:middle line:10%
in the divine image.

01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It was never one group,
one race, one type.

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.530 align:middle line:90%
All.

01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Rabbi, how did
you get so cool?

01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:53.680 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's riding my
Harley, raising my dogs,

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.520 align:middle line:10%
having my beautiful wife.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.080 align:middle line:10%
A whole bunch of
different things.

01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.333 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:45:59.333 --> 01:46:00.259 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:46:00.259 --> 01:46:03.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Billy, we're here tonight
celebrating 50 years

01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of "Chariots of the Gods."

01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:11.250 align:middle line:10%
How thankful are
you for that book?

01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I am very thankful
to Mr. von Daniken.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been a very big fan of
his for a very, very long time.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.540 align:middle line:84%
His work has led me into
research, into the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the seven [INAUDIBLE]
of creation, the epic,

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.670 align:middle line:84%
the Epic of Gilgamesh, the
Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita,

01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:33.230 align:middle line:90%
the Indian Vedas.

01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:35.240 align:middle line:10%
Because of this man,
I literally have

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.150 align:middle line:10%
become considered one
of the top researchers

01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:41.280 align:middle line:10%
in the world in ancient
history, ancient societies.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thank him
so much for that.

01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Because he was able
to be a conduit

01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to receive the information
and to then take--

01:46:48.650 --> 01:46:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that he
had this information

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and to put it out there in a
way that people can consume it.

01:46:55.190 --> 01:46:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's not easy to do.

01:46:57.850 --> 01:47:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And the next level
was that it inspired

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:05.580 align:middle line:84%
me to write my own book,
which is now doing very well.

01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you, as well, Jimmy,

01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:09.710 align:middle line:84%
for doing the forward
on the next one.

01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But thank you very much, Erich
von Daniken, because you really

01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
have had a very, very
huge impact on my life.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Very kind of you.

01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So Linda, I'm going to let
you have the last word.

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So you just be patient.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You just be patient.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Jason.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So kind of along the lines
of what Billy was saying,

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's interesting
is when I first--

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm 45,
and 20 years ago,

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:37.910 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
talking about these topics,

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:40.530 align:middle line:84%
people struggle how to
communicate this stuff in a way

01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:43.740 align:middle line:84%
where the person listening
to you is grasping it.

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there's only been
a handful of research.

01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can literally only name
really two, Zecharia Sitchin,

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.050 align:middle line:90%
God rest his soul.

01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot about
linguistics from him,

01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:57.150 align:middle line:84%
mentioning a lot of the
things that you said there.

01:47:57.150 --> 01:47:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And then from Erich, I
got a lot of the visuals,

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the actual locations.

01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:03.840 align:middle line:10%
And then some of these things
are just basic concepts

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.980 align:middle line:10%
but made such an impact when
being able to communicate it

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:07.780 align:middle line:10%
to others.

01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Things like cargo cult, where
you can see in the video

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.860 align:middle line:90%
"Chariots of the Gods."

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple concept.

01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:14.407 align:middle line:84%
There's these
Aboriginals, they've

01:48:14.407 --> 01:48:17.310 align:middle line:84%
made a straw model of a plane,
they scrape away a runway,

01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're staring
for hours, trying

01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:21.390 align:middle line:84%
to get these planes
to come back.

01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the same concept of what
we were doing for thousands

01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:26.290 align:middle line:90%
of years in some form.

01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:28.740 align:middle line:10%
So I thank you, Erich, for
being able to arm myself,

01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and others, with facts
and knowledge that give us

01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:35.190 align:middle line:10%
a passion infusion so that
I can explain it to others

01:48:35.190 --> 01:48:37.740 align:middle line:10%
and they're like, damn,
[EXPLODING SOUND]..

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's really a gift,
to be able to inspire

01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:42.040 align:middle line:90%
others to carry that message.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:43.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very kindly.

01:48:43.882 --> 01:48:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for that, Jason.

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda, you've known Erich
for a very, very long time.

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.880 align:middle line:84%
How thankful are you
to Erich for 50 years

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.800 align:middle line:90%
of "Chariots of the Gods?"

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I honor him
in every way possible.

01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first time that I

01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:06.590 align:middle line:84%
read "Chariots of the Gods"
I was at Stanford University.

01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I was working on a master's
degree in communication.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the
physics department.

01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a documentary
for the medical center.

01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:19.080 align:middle line:84%
All things related
to hard science.

01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.770 align:middle line:90%
But the book just seared me.

01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It went in.

01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:27.015 align:middle line:90%
And when I look back--

01:49:27.015 --> 01:49:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that would have been at
the end of the '60s--

01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
a decade later,

01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in '79, that I would begin
a path that would not

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.940 align:middle line:84%
end for 40-some years into the
future, which was to find out

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:46.790 align:middle line:84%
why animals around the
world were being killed

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and excisions
taken from the body

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.460 align:middle line:84%
without any blood and no
tracks and even internal organs

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:56.610 align:middle line:84%
missing upon necropsy with
no surgical [? incisions ?]

01:49:56.610 --> 01:49:58.890 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the body.

01:49:58.890 --> 01:50:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And having [? Sheriff ?]
say to me, Linda,

01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the perpetrators are
creatures from outer space.

01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they would back up
their own eyewitness stories

01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
of having seen
beams of light come

01:50:10.590 --> 01:50:14.790 align:middle line:84%
from circular lights in the
sky with an animal going down

01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to the ground or an animal
rising in a beam of light.

01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to get those
witnesses to talk on television

01:50:23.610 --> 01:50:26.550 align:middle line:84%
about seeing animals
rising in a technology

01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that we humans did not
have and were not using.

01:50:29.730 --> 01:50:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And the ranchers would say,
I'll never, never, never stand

01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in front of a TV camera, because
everybody will say I'm crazy.

01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so incredible
about this moment tonight.

01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:45.920 align:middle line:84%
We're all beginning
to finally talk

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.800 align:middle line:84%
more with each other
about the truth

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and that the animal mutilations
are a disturbing and strange

01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.550 align:middle line:84%
part of an interaction
with other intelligences.

01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that
to you with firm fact

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:08.860 align:middle line:90%
beyond all that I have reported.

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
There are hostiles,
there are friendlies,

01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and there are neutrals
in all of this.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You and I and the entire planet
deserve to be told all of it.

01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're never going
to be able to stand up

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.320 align:middle line:90%
if we aren't told the truth.

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And this man started
this 50 years ago.

01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Linda.

01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Very nice.

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm going to sum it up.

01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Linda is blaming Erich for
her change of direction

01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.890 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford.

01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] starting it.

01:51:48.210 --> 01:51:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Erich, thank you.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But here's the obvious
question, young man.

01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:57.190 align:middle line:90%
What is next?

01:51:57.190 --> 01:52:05.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We all, each and every
human, we have in us a monster.

01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:08.500 align:middle line:84%
This monster is
called curiosity.

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.510 align:middle line:90%
We all are curious.

01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can do nothing
against curiosity.

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:17.170 align:middle line:10%
Curiosity means
asking questions.

01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And curiosity will bring
mankind to outer space.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Just dream, dream
with me, imagine

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:31.270 align:middle line:84%
our scientific community
would know everything.

01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:34.160 align:middle line:84%
We made a whole drought
through our planet.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We know the inside
of the planet.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.450 align:middle line:84%
We have studied all animals,
all brains of humans.

01:52:39.450 --> 01:52:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Simply we know everything.

01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything, it's a dream.

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.270 align:middle line:90%
What will be [INAUDIBLE] next?

01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:49.300 align:middle line:84%
There are still little lights
out there in the Milky Way,

01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:50.440 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
monster curiosity,

01:52:52.690 --> 01:52:56.260 align:middle line:84%
we are forced to ask, and
what the hell is this?

01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later,
we have no chance.

01:52:58.990 --> 01:53:01.660 align:middle line:84%
We will go out there
and find it out.

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.970 align:middle line:10%
And if we do find out,
where do we come from,

01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:07.960 align:middle line:10%
how have we developed,
this is all curiosity.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.880 align:middle line:90%
We are all curious.

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.090 align:middle line:10%
As long as my brain functions--

01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:15.280 align:middle line:10%
and at the moment, it
functions very well--

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.100 align:middle line:10%
I'll go on and
write and research.

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And I never end until I die.

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too!

01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:24.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:53:24.385 --> 01:53:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank all of you.

01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:29.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the 2019 Conscious
Life Expo here in Los Angeles,

01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:31.820 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting live
around the world.

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Please, stand up and give
it up for Jason Martell.

01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:36.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Linda Moulton Howe.

01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Stand up.

01:53:38.890 --> 01:53:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Take a bow.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Erich von Daniken.

01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:45.990 align:middle line:10%
Mr. Billy Carson.

01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok.

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jimmy
Church, for tonight.

01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank all of you.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
getting loud enough.

01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Everybody, have a great evening.

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Give it up.

01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.054 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear it.

01:53:59.054 --> 01:54:00.990 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:03.900 align:middle line:90%


01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you again.

01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:06.205 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:54:06.205 --> 01:54:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Good night.

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:16.726 align:middle line:90%
