00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> How fundamental is spin to
the universe and our lives?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
explore the origin of spin

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.856 align:middle line:84%
and how spin produces
everything in our world.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.316 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:10%
>> You will hear me say,
everything is spinning.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:10%
And you might
disagree with that.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily obvious
that spin is everywhere.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Relative to you, things
seem to be stable.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
They're not
necessarily spinning.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
However, if you look carefully,
the things that you're seeing

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
are made out of atoms
that have spin in them.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And these atoms
are on the planet

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that's spinning at about
1,000 miles per hour.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And that planet is
spinning around the sun.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
you add that speed,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
the planet is going about
68,000 miles per hour.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is inside a
galaxy that's spinning.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, by the time
you add that speed,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
everything is going at about
500,000 miles per hour.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And then that galaxy's inside
that cluster that's spinning.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
you add that speed,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
you're at about
1,200,000 miles per hour.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So things are moving really,
really quick and spinning

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:90%
at very high velocity.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's not apparent to us.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems
stable because we

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
are looking at things
relative to us that

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:90%
are spinning at the same rate.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:90%
But everything is spinning.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:10%
Spin is fundamental
in the universe.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:90%
You see it everywhere.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Galaxies are spinning.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Planets, stars,
everything is spinning.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
really deep about that.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would energy that's
fluctuating make anything?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, it could be completely
incoherent, stochastic,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and just fluctuate and
nothing would come out of it.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The only time
something like that--

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
an organization of
fluctuation would

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
occur is when there would
be a coherent pattern that

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:90%
would develop in that field.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Why would a coherent pattern
develop in that field?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Why would there be islands
of coherencies in that field?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:10%
Well, if there's a gradient
in the density of that field,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:10%
then there would
be automatically

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:10%
spin that would develop.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at the vacuum
density, these fluctuations,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum density at
the cosmological size,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
which we are measuring,
it's very low.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 to the minus 30
grams per centimeter cubed.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And experimentally, when we
look at the vacuum density

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum scale, we
see that the vacuum density

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum scale
is very, very high--

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 93 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is a huge
change in density.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
This change in density,
in the standard model,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
has become the biggest
problem in physics.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
vacuum catastrophe.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum field theory predicts
a very large energy density

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
for the vacuum.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And this density should have
large gravitational effects.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
However, these effects
are not observed,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and the discrepancy between
theory and observation

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is an incredible 122
orders of magnitude.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the
largest error in physics--

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
considered the largest
error in physics.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
We just published paper showing,
it's not an error at all.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's because when
the universe grows,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
the density drops in
the vacuum density.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
produces this low density

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
at the size of the universe
and very high density

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:90%
at the size of a proton.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
We made those calculations.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we calculated
for those radiuses

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
for the change of radius from
the proton to the universe,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
we got the right density that
we're measuring in both cases.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
It all works out beautifully.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So we know that it's
just a change of density

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum that
produces this discrepancy

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
between cosmological density
of this ether of the vacuum

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and quantum density
of the vacuum.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a change of
density that high.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Think of a hurricane.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of a hurricane,
a very small slight change

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
in temperature
between the surface

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
of the water of the ocean and
the atmospheric temperature,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
a few degrees,
three degrees will

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
produce a very
large energy event

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
we call a hurricane, with large
electromagnetic discharges,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
millions of tons of
materials spinning.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
hurricane, what do we see?

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
A structure that is
very, very similar

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to what we see when we look
at the galaxy, for instance.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Even in the case of a hurricane,
which you would believe

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is a much lower energy
level than a galaxy,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
we see antimatter
production at--

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
they're called sprites,
which are emanating

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:90%
from the center of a hurricane.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:10%
So we see these
sprites of antimatter

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:10%
that is gamma
emission is occurring

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:10%
at the center of
hurricane, where

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't think there
would be the energy levels

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:10%
to do that.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
However, let's continue
with the analogy.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Think at that very small
change in air density

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
producing that big
of an energy event.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about 122 orders
of magnitude difference

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
in the density of the
vacuum between the universe

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and the quantum world.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It would spin the
structure of space

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
very intensely from
the universal size,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
the quantum size.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And this spinning
is what organizes

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:10%
this fundamental
field into structures

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:10%
that we see as our reality.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We've solved for this
spin vacuum structure

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
from the universal size all the
way down to the quantum size.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We found that the spin function,
or the change of density,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is spinning everything we see,
all the way down to protons

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and subatomic particle.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So really, everything
we're seeing that we think

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
is matter is actually
space spinning.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing we see.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, the proof of that--

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and this is really important--

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
is that by writing these
equations this way,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
we obviously got the mass for
clusters, for super clusters,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
for galaxies, for planets,
atoms, subatomic particles.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
When we added the
whole thing up,

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
we got the correct
mass for the universe.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get just the mass
of the matter in the universe,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
but we got the mass
of the universe, which

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
includes what is in the
standard model called

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:90%
dark matter and dark energy.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So let me explain
this a little bit.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
In the standard model,
when they run the equations

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have for
cosmology, they end up

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
with a deficiency of
mass for the universe.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
96% of the mass
of the universe is

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
missing in the standard model
equations for the universe

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:90%
to behave the way it does.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
At the time, they
just thought, there

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:90%
must be mass we can't see.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
There must be
energy we can't see,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to call it
dark energy and dark matter.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The dark matter was necessary
for galaxies to stay together.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, there wasn't
enough mass that's

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
visible in the galaxy to
hold the stars together,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to have enough gravity for the
stars not to spin out of there.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So they had to have 80%
of the mass, the galaxy,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in dark matter around the galaxy
to keep the mass high enough

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
for the stars to stay in there.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
They did the same thing
with the universe.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
For the expansion
of the universe

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to happen the way
it is, they had

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
to add dark energy in the
space, the vacuum fluctuation,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
in the space to
make the expansion

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:90%
of the universe the way it is.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
standard model equation

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
can only account for 4% of
the mass of the universe.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
All the rest of the stuff
is a fudge factor called

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%
dark energy and dark matter.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Dark matter is one of the
universe's greatest mysteries.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Something is out there
generating gravitational force

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that can't be accounted
for by detectable matter.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And even though
detectors have been

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
built with all
kinds of experiments

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to detect dark
matter, they still

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to find it.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is
with the equation,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:90%
not with the universe.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, our equation
gives the correct mass

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't just
consider the matter.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It considers that the matter
is made out of these vacuum

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:84%
fluctuations, and it consider
all of the vacuum fluctuations

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Think of a galaxy.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
All the stars and the dust
and the plasma in that galaxy

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
makes up what we think of
the mass of the galaxy.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But when we calculate
that, as I said,

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
we end up deficient in
the mass for the galaxy

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:90%
to behave that way.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The galaxy spin, like
there is solid body.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because
what we see in the galaxy

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:84%
is just the stuff that's stuck
in the spin of the vacuum

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
structure, the spacetime
of this super fluid.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And we then calculate that in
the standard model equations

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:90%
when we calculated the mass.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we're
missing most of the mass

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
because we're missing
the source of the spin.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a dark
coffee or a really dark tea.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And you spin it with
your spoon in the morning

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:90%
before you put the milk.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Take out the spoon,
and you won't

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
be able to see the coffee spin.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you
think of the coffee

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:10%
in the cup as empty
space because you

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:10%
don't know it's there.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And then put the milk in it,
and you'll see like a shape

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
just like a galaxy emerge in
the middle of your coffee.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like the standard model
has only calculated the milk

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
and is missing the coffee.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the
equation ends up

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
with the wrong mass
for the whole thing,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's missing
most of the energy level

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that makes that
phenomenon happen.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The structure of spacetime is
the only thing that exists.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
makes up our reality

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is the spin of this vacuum
fluctuation producing

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
super clusters, clusters,
galaxies, stars, planets,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
atoms, subatomic particle,
all the way down to the Planck

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
field, and even the sub-Planck.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It most likely
spins into infinity

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and produces singularity.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This is how everything
comes to exist.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
When you look around you
at the biological level,

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
you will see the spin if
you observe very closely,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
like the fluids moving
through the trunk of a tree.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The way flowers and plants
emerge, the spin that emerged.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The Fibonacci theory that
you can see everywhere that

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
produce the spiral
that we see everywhere

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
in the fractal
structure of nature.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Even the spin of your
blood inside your body,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
going through all your
arteries and veins.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
The spin of air as it spins
into your lungs as you inhale,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
as you exhale as well.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
The spin of our weather
system and the structure

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of the coriolis forces
of our atmosphere.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You will see spin everywhere,
because spin originates

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
from this gradient
density change

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of the
vacuum that spins everything

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
into existence.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine
you're taking a bath,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that you have a
rubber ducky in your bath.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have the rubber ducky
far away from the drain,

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and you pull that drain.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And you observe
that in that region,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
there is a coherent
structure that's

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
being generated by the
gradient in the drain,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
by the change in
density in the drain.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Air is coming out, and
the water is going down.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
The air coming out spins up.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:90%
The water going down spins down.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look at the
structure of the water, all

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the molecules of the water
in that region of space,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
they would all be co-moving
in a coordinated manner.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Your rubber ducky
over there doesn't

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
feel that the spin of
the drain because it's

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
too far away from it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you bring
it closer, it will

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
get caught in that
co-moving structure,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:90%
and it will orbit the drain.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
This is very much what Einstein
field equation describes.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Einstein field equation
looks at the surface

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
of the water in our
analogy and the surface

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
of the water curving towards the
drain as the source of gravity,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:84%
as the source of the effect
that the rubber ducky

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:90%
is falling towards the drain.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But we know from our
analogy that it's not just

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the surface of
the water curving.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:84%
That that is a secondary
effect of the water

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
spinning, of all the
molecules of water spinning.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the error that was made.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Einstein field equation assume
that the surface of the water

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
is like a continuous surface.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you in your
bath, looking at the drain

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:84%
from in the water and
your rubber ducky,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the water
appears smooth, continuous.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
But you know that if you put
the water under a microscope

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that it's made out of
particles, discrete pieces.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
These discrete
pieces spin together

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and makes what appears to be
smooth curvature on the surface

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
so the source of this
spin, or the source

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of the gravitational effect,
is actually the water spinning.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
This is what I discovered is
that spacetime is not smooth.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime at the quantum
level is discrete--

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
made of teeny little particle.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And they are very, very small.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of
times smaller than an atom.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:90%
They're at the Planck scale.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The energy between these
trillions and trillions of tiny

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
particles spinning and
interacting together is what

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
gives protons and
neutrons their mass.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Protons, along
with neutrons, are

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the nucleus of the atom,
where the atom's mass is

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:90%
concentrated.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we call it mass because
we see an energy event that

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
when they're together
produce gravity.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we think there's
mass and gravity

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and that those
things are separate.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there's
just spacetime

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
spinning, producing an
effect we call a proton.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And that proton produces
a curvature in the space.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The spinning is the
curvature, and that produces

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:90%
a gravitational effect.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
equation we wrote

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
gives the correct
mass for the universe

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:84%
without the need of dark
matter and dark energy and all

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
this weird darkness,
which I called

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
the dark ages of physics.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, gives
a correct answer

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
because it is calculating
the source of the creation.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, I just explained to
you the source of creation,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and I can prove it to you
because I have the equations

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
that give the right numbers.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
the right numbers,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, really,
really the right numbers,

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
with very high
level of accuracy.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Including predictions,
for instance,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
the prediction of the
radius of the proton,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
which is different than the
standard model prediction,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and that has now been confirmed
by experimental studies, which

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
is really important for a theory
to be able to do predictions

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and to have them
confirmed by experiments.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So this is very, very important.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Now you understand the
source of creation.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:90%
This is a very profound thing.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You can think of
it philosophically

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:90%
as something very profound.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think of the
spin of creation producing you,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
producing your
reality around you,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
being part of this spinning
mechanism of creation

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
then you can interact with
it in a very conscious way.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.285 align:middle line:84%
It has a very deep implication
as well to technology.

00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
If you realize that
mass, energy, gravity

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is being generated by
spinning spacetime,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
then you can go in
laboratory and figure out

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:90%
how to spin spacetime.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
That would maybe produce
all kinds of effect

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that could be very
beneficial for humanity.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And we'll discuss that and
later on during the series.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But what's important
in this episode

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
is that you understand
that all of your reality

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is the result of the spin
of this vacuum structure.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying this lightly.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very critical that you
feel this within yourself.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that many of the
meditation techniques that

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
were given to us by
ancient civilization

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and advanced masters
around the world

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:84%
have to do with finding
the center of that spin.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Finding the center
singularity of the frame

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of reference of your spin.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that would be the
place from which the center

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:90%
of your existence emerges.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And since it has fractal spin
to infinity, as we describe,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
you could find deeper and deeper
level of this center of spin

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:90%
that makes up your existence.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a much
more philosophical,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and you could say even
spiritual description of what

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm describing in physics.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But the implication
includes as well the dynamic

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
in which these little particles,
these Planck particles

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%
are moving.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to discuss that
in further episodes, because it

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
has implications as well to
consciousness and awareness.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
That is, these particles
that makes up the field

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.555 align:middle line:84%
are moving in very
specific dynamic structure.

00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:48.430 align:middle line:84%
A fluid that's spinning
produces coriolis effect.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:10%
These coriolis effects
produce spin, counter spin.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:90%
They produce toroidial systems.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
These torodial systems
have particles falling in,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:90%
particles coming out.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you start
to see, oh, OK, so gravity

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
is the water going in,
and electromagnetism

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
is the water going out.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And the radiation is
the water going out.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And now you're starting
to see-- and then

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:84%
if you apply that to
information theory,

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:84%
it starts to tell
you that like there's

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
some kind of information
feedback in the universe.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And that leads, eventually,
to the possibility

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
of being able to explain
consciousness right out

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of these equations.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want is really stress
that I'm not talking about this

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:90%
in a very philosophical way.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about this very
formally in mathematics.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And these formal mathematics
give the correct answer

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
with high level of precision for
all the scales in the universe,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:90%
including the table of elements.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Think of the table of
elements as having different

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:10%
spin rates within
the vacuum structure,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:10%
producing different elements.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:10%
When Nassim and his team
applied these equations

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:10%
to the table of elements,
they got the periodic table,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:10%
but in a completely
different way

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:10%
than from the traditional one.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In this case, the table of
element is the result of spin

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
rate changes in the gradient
of the vacuum of spacetime

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:90%
and gives the right answer.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So we get all of the matter,
all of the particles,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:90%
all of creation that we see.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
the equation

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
tells us all that you're
seeing and all that makes you

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and your world is all
the result of one thing.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It unifies everything
under one thing.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
important concept

00:23:55.270 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that has been talked about
across the ages by masters, all

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
the way through our
history that there

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:90%
is oneness in the universe.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%
That everything is one.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, this actually proves it.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely clear that
these equations, which

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
are very accurate and give
the correct answers for all

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of the systems in
the universe, are

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:36.075 align:middle line:84%
equations that can eventually
be utilized to maybe even create

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:36.875 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You could imagine even in
a sci-fi way, a very, very

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization that
has used this understanding

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to eventually create a galaxy
or a universe or a multiverse.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It's very enticing.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
When you see these
equations, these equations

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
can give you the road map
to engineer a universe.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is extremely powerful.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And we will discuss the
implication of that technology

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
in further episodes.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, it's
really powerful conceptually

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
to start to understand our
universe in a way in which we

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
actually realize that the static
appearance of our existence--

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the appearance that
everything that's stable

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and nothing is spinning is
actually just an illusion

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're spinning
at the same rate

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:90%
as this stuff around us.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:10%
And that spin is the
fundamental force

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:10%
is a result of this gradient
in the vacuum structure

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:10%
and is the fundamental
mechanics that

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:10%
produces all of our reality.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]
