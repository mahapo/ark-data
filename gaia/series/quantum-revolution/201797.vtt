00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there life in the
rest of our universe?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.950 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
discuss the probability

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:90%
that it may be abundant.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there life in the
rest of the universe?

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:10%
It's a good question.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:10%
But there is many
pieces of information

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
that we need to have
in order to answer it.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if we look
at the abundance of life

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, the
assumption would

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
be that there should
be similar planets

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the universe.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
From early times
in my research, I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
calculated some of
the probabilities.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:10%
And I came to conclude
that there most likely was

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:10%
a lot of life in the universe.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of difficulties
convincing my colleagues

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
at the time because
there was assumptions

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that were made early on that
were completely incorrect.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the assumption
that was made

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
was that it would be rare to
find a star that has a planet

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because most of the environment
around stars are pretty harsh,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and it would be hard
to find a planet then

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that would be in the
Goldilocks zone or the zone

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
where the planet is not too hot
from its star or not too cold

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
away from its star
to sustain life.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have to make
this distinction as well,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
life as we know it.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, life can develop in
situations and circumstances

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
that we thought impossible.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
For instance, early on, we
thought it was impossible

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that life would develop in some
deep vents inside the ocean,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
where the water
is almost boiling,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and there is almost
zero sunlight.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We thought life could never
sustain in those depths,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in those temperature, and in
these low light environment.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we finally built
submarines and probes that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
could go down there,
we discovered life

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't know existed,
that lived down there happily

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
in the dark and in
the boiling water.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So we have a pretty limited
idea of what life needs in order

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:90%
to sustain or to develop.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Who says that life could
not develop in very, very

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
hot environment, in
atmospheres that are completely

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
different gas, sulfuric
gas, or nitrogen, very

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
high in nitrogen. Rich gas
with all kinds of things

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that we think of completely
toxic to life here,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
but that could
develop completely

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
differently somewhere else.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But this early assumption
that planets were very rare

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
around stars start
to break apart

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in the late '90s, when we
discovered that they seemed

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:90%
to be planets orbiting pulsars.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Not really astonished physicists
because the environment

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:10%
near a pulsar is
very, very harsh.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.480 align:middle line:84%
A pulsar is a result of a star
that has exploded, a supernova.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It was thought that there
should be nothing around there,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:90%
certainly not planets.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it was kind of surprising
to find the first evidence

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of planets near pulsars.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I predicted that
they would be there

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
because remember, our
model of the universe

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that we discussed earlier,
in which the vacuum

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
structure organized
in smaller vortices

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
around stars that makes
aggregate the matter

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and makes planets.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
These vortices
would be very, very

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
much prominent after the
explosion of a star, which

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
would throw a
whole lot of energy

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
into the structure
of the vacuum,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
into the structure
of space time, which

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
would make very strong
vortices around that star.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And all the material that
was ejected by the supernova

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
would be perfect building
blocks to build planets

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
around what used to be
a star and is now called

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
a pulsar or a black hole.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
That was astonishing,
but since then, we've

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
made great strides in being able
to detect exoplanets, planets

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
outside our solar system,
and we found many of them.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in 2013,
we were astonished

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to find that there was planets
around almost every star we

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:90%
looked at.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
planets out there.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But the estimate in 2013
was about 40 billion planets

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy that are
in the Goldilocks zone.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:10%
Planets that could sustain
life as we know it.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:90%
40 billion.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:90%
That is a lot of planets.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because there's
a lot of stars in our galaxy,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and most stars have planets.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the probability
of some of these planets

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to be in the right zone to
sustain life is pretty high.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So the probability for life
or at least for a planet

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to be in the right zone to
sustain life in our galaxy

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:90%
is very high.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:10%
If we extrapolate
that to the universe,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:10%
the numbers are staggering.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, we thought there was
about 200 billion galaxies

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
We've now updated that in 2016
to about 2 trillion galaxies

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%
We were missing a few.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you extrapolate
the 40 billion

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Earth-like planet that
would be in those galaxies,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
you end up with about 80
billion trillion planets

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that could sustain life
in our universe alone.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And that is remarkable.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a universe
that's teeming with life.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
However, you need other
elements than a good planet

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
in the right zone to
get life to emerge.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You need elements,
such as water being

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
one of the fundamental
building blocks of life.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the arguments
I would get from my colleagues

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
in the '90s.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, even if there
is a plan that's

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
out there that
could sustain life,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
they probably don't
have water on them

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because water is extremely
rare in our universe.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Those assumptions were wrong.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
In the '90s, in the
2000s, we sent probes out

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to measure and look for
spectral lines of water

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%
all over the universe.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't been able to
find a place in the universe

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
where there's no water.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:90%
There's water everywhere.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Even in interstellar space, we
see spectral lines of water,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:90%
which is very high vacuum.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But even as well
intergalactic space

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to have
water molecules in them.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So we see spectral lines of
water even between galaxies.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's water
everywhere we look.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when we
look at stars developing,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
like the birth of
stars, typically

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
we see a lot of
water in that region.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
And we see the star forming
from the middle of that water,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
like immense universal
placentas birthing stars.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So we know that all the building
blocks for life are there.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:90%
They're abundant.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The planets that would
sustain life are abound.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
extremely large.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
atmospheres and so on.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it is clear that
life can and should

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:90%
be found in the universe.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the
complexity of that life

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:90%
is most likely present as well.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Because for the system to
increase in complexity,

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
the abundance of the
elements, and all the minerals

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and amino acids,
and all the stuff

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary
for life eventually

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
would create this complexity.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So all you need is
time for the system

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to have enough feedback
structure to eventually produce

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:90%
that complexity.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is definitely
present, meaning

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that planetary
system in galaxies

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
might be thousands of
years older than ours,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
millions of years older
than ours, billions of years

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:90%
older than us.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine
what complexity can

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
emerge from a system that is
billions of year older than us.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's just think of 1,000 years.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Think about what life looked
like on Earth 1,000 years ago.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, there
was much less people, right?

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:10%
And certainly, their
technology was nowhere

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:10%
close to what it is today.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, only in 200 years
of technical development

00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and modern era of technology
did we go from horse and buggy

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to spaceships, and being able
to launch satellites in space,

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and cell phones, and
everything we see today.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So when the
technological era starts,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:90%
it can develop very fast.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So what would a cell phone
look like 1,000 years from now?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that a society that
would have just a little 1,000

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:84%
years more evolution than us,
started their evolution maybe

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years earlier
than us, which

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
is nothing cosmologically,
would lead a civilization today

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
to have a technology
vastly more advanced

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
than we have right now.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Like your smartphone typically
gets its technology updated

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
every few years.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You have new software updates
that happens every few months.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It continues to do better
things, faster, stronger,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and to make your life a
little easier hopefully.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
What does your computer look
like 1,000 years from now?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You're probably not using
a keyboard and a mouse

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
to interact with it anymore.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you're able to
just talk to your computer,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's doing what
you want it to do.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Or it might even be able to read
the wave forms in your brain

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and know exactly what you want.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
What does that computer look
like a few thousand years?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
What about a
million years, which

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
is nothing in the universe?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
The movement of our solar
system in the galaxy

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
is rotating around a
vortex arm of the galaxy.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It takes 30 million years
to go from the equator

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to the equator of the
galaxy and another 30

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to come around back around.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:90%
So like 60 million years.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
What does your computer look
like 60 million years from now?

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
absolutely not irrational

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to think of a society
that could have

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
developed millions and
millions of years ahead of us.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And that society most
likely eventually

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
found a way to travel through
the black holes and worm holes

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:90%
of our world, of our universe.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:10%
That society has probably
found the structure

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:10%
of the vacuum, the
Planck field, knows out

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:10%
to utilize it as fuel, and is
able to go around the galaxy

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.700 align:middle line:10%
just like you go
around the planet

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:10%
today, getting into
an airport in LA,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:10%
and landing in Sydney
a few hours later,

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:10%
and not thinking twice about it.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
If you went on the air
150 years ago backwards

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and talk to someone
with a horse and buggy

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and told them that in
a few generations, only

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
a few generation,
people would get

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
into metal objects that
could fly through the air

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and go across the world.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They would have burnt
you at the stake.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not hard to
imagine when we actually

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
consider the span of times
of our galaxy or even

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
our universe, that an
advanced civilization,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
multiple advanced civilization,
maybe millions, maybe billions

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of advanced civilization
have achieved that capability

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to go around the galaxy the way
we go around our planet today

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:90%
and not think twice about it.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We've seen evidence of that.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:84%
We've seen plenty
of evidence of that.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:12.140 align:middle line:10%
Now the evidence is pretty
well bombproof at this point.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It's been released
by military personnel

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in the last few months even.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
There has been encounters
with objects in our airspace

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that don't obey the
physics that we know of,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that have capabilities
that we don't

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
have in our technological
developments.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed to have been
there for a very long time

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
as they were reported by a
many, many different individuals

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages, including
ancient civilization that

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
claim to have had direct
contact with sun gods that

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:90%
came from the stars.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone in our universe?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Most likely not.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most likely, our
universe is teeming with life.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:84%
This is a conservative
view, since we're only

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
considering the possibility
of life as we know it,

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
which would develop
in water, not

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
in cyanide, or in some
fluid metal like mercury,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:84%
where we don't think
life could emerge.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe life could
emerge in mercury

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:90%
under the right circumstances.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're
discovering that some

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
of the harshest environments
we see in our universe, that

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:84%
is the environment close to
a black hole, where there's

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of radiation and high
energy physics going on,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
there is a Goldilocks
zone, where

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
life requires this level
of radiation to develop.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:10%
And that actually, there is
a region near black holes

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:10%
that have the highest
possibility to actually produce

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:10%
life, that life
could require having

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:10%
orbited in certain
regions of the environment

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:10%
near a black hole
in order to develop.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the physics,
we are discovering now,

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
from the physics
we're writing now,

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
we have shown that actually
all the scales are different,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
meaning black holes
at the atomic level

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and different sized black
holes in our cosmology.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
These are not
necessarily obvious.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
For instance, people don't think
of the sun as a black hole.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sun obeys the perfect
condition for a black body.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
A black body is a body
in which all incident

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:90%
light is absorbed, right?

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
A body in which all
incident light is absorbed

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
would have to be a
perfect emitter as well.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And so our sun actually obeys
the condition of a black body.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And astrophysicists
and physicists

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, yeah, but the
sun doesn't have the mass.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be
a much shorter radius

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
with the same amount of
material to be a black hole.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
A radius very short,
almost 18 kilometers,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:90%
which it is not currently.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So they will tell
you that in general,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:90%
the sun cannot be a black hole.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Stellar black holes are
not produced by a supernova

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
exploding, making
the black hole.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Stellar black holes
are already there,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
are produced by the structure
of space time spinning.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And when the stars explode,
and the plasma goes away,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff that's
stuck in the fluid dynamics

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of space time
around the black hole when

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that goes away, then
we see the black hole.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And we say, oh, it
made a black hole.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make it.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:90%
The black hole was always there.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So these black
holes are starting

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to emerge as not these
monsters that are just

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
absorbing everything around
them and destroying everything,

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
but actually as the source of
the mechanics that makes up

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
all of them structure that
makes life possible, including

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
the radiation that's required
for the amino acids and all

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
of the molecules to
organize into DNA structure

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
and eventually life.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So they are life
givers, not destroyers.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
They are the source
of creation and that's

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
a very big change in our
understanding of our universe,

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and how life emerge in
it, and how much life

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:90%
is present in our universe.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of the life in the universe
is most likely very, very

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
much more advanced
than us and might

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
have traveled across the
galaxy and found our planet

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
a very long time ago.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, life in
the universe could

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
develop in all kinds
of different way

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and may not look
humanoid at all.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They might be very short, very
small, very big, very hairy,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
not hairy at all.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Or they might have six arms,
and two hands, and so on.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, life could develop
in all kinds of way,

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
including the way
it developed here.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So they could be life that
is very, very similar to us

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:90%
or almost exactly like us.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And they could walk in our
streets, in our cities,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and we wouldn't be able
to tell that they're not

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:90%
from our planet.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
We would have no clue.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So life could vary
widely, including

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that it might have
a different density

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:84%
than the density of life
that we know on our planet.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It might have a range at
a different energy level

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:90%
in a different environment.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:10%
That is it might have a
range within the energy

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:10%
confinement of a plasma.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you could have
life that looks much more

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
esoteric than the physical
life we see on our planet.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:84%
You could have life
that looks more

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
like a cloud of glowing
plasma going around in a ball

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
or in some kind of
elongated structure

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in the air near a gravitational
field, for instance.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
If it was a plasma ball in
space, when it got close to you

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.845 align:middle line:84%
know tidal gravity near
the surface of a planet,

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:84%
it might get on gated into
something more oval, something

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
more like the aura around a
person without the person.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Just the aura.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
You could have something
completely different than what

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:90%
we think of as life.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:10%
Because it is the
flow of information

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:10%
through the structure
of space that

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:10%
produces the organization and
eventually the self awareness

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:10%
of that life.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And that flow is
present everywhere

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and can organize in all
kinds of different ways

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and produce eventually
a similar effect.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we talked
about the brain is not

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the seat of consciousness.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:84%
The brain is not producing the
epiphenomenon of consciousness.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the brain
is the antenna capturing

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the information of the flow.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the antenna
might look different

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in different circumstances,
completely different.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
actually the brain

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%
is one part of the antenna.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Your whole bone structure,
the piezoelectric dynamics

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of your bone, all
your connective tissue

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
with all the silica
in it and all this.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It's your whole body that's
the antenna of consciousness.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of that body
looking completely different,

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
having a complexity
range completely

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
different than the one we
have on Earth, for instance.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that life
emerged from a plasma.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:84%
That plasma could
be at energy levels

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond the observable
energy level of our world.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be, for
instance, that life

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
emerge in the coherency of the
structure of the Planck field.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
In our case, we are
linked to the Planck field

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
for our consciousness
and our life.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But it has a range at
a scale very specific

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
that we see at the very
specific band of frequency.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
We touch and feel at
the very specific scale.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We can smell at the very
specific scale of molecules.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But life could develop
at scales or energy level

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that are nowhere close
to that same band.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And that life would
not be evident to us.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't see it.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't touch it.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't smell it.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't measure it.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't know it's there.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the building blocks
of DNA, the amino acids

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
we see flying everywhere in
the universe are present.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So of course then,
DNA, which we think

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of as the basis for the
development of life,

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
could emerge on
many other planets.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:84%
DNA, not being the system that
actually holds the information,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:84%
but more like DNA being
the antenna that's

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
vibrating in the
structure of space

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
with the help of
the water molecule.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:84%
If we remove to move the water
molecule, then DNA falls apart.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, recently
we've discovered,

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
this was published at
the Academy of Science,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that it is the water molecule
that modulate the DNA, not

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the other way around.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the information is
coming from the water molecule.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
This is why all life
emerged from water

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, at least
life as we know it.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So DNA might actually
be found to exist

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:84%
on many other planets, similar
DNA as the DNA we see here.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But then again, they could
be, as I described earlier,

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
entities that are far removed
from this grosser or more

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:84%
denser level of
existence, and that

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
may have something
that looks like DNA,

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
but that is made out of
a plasma spiral spinning

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
in space, instead of
mitochondria, and so on.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be
vastly different,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but certainly, all the
elements for the development

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and the replication
of DNA are present

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
in the various molecules we
see that are present in space,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and the water, and clearly the
amount of planetary systems

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that are available for all
that to coalesce into life.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:90%
We're clearly not alone.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:84%
That we are probably part
of a galactic community that

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.225 align:middle line:84%
could have millions, if not
billions of members involved.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:84%
As well, the idea
that they would all

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:84%
be less advanced than us or
not much more advanced and thus

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:90%
is erroneous.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:10%
Out of the probability of
all the life in our galaxy,

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:10%
the most likely
is societies that

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:10%
have achieved faster than the
speed of light travel, that

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:10%
have been able to cross the
universe using wormhole,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:10%
the advancements
of these societies

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:10%
with millions of years of
development ahead of us

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:10%
are tremendous and are the stuff
that we can only dream of here.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So we most likely were
discovered early on.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like there was
some interaction with our world

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:90%
very early on.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:90%
There is less now.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:90%
We're a very aggressive species.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
If you just watch
the 5 o'clock news,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty apparent
we are not very

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
developed in our social
relationship with each other.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
We haven't managed to understand
that we're one species,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and that we should stop
shooting at each other.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're probably
waiting for us

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to learn some of the
fundamental wisdom required

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:84%
for us to enter as member
of this larger community.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But all the evidence is there
to show that life is probably

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:90%
teeming in our universe.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And that we have an opportunity
to discover that life

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:84%
as we grow and understand deeper
the meaning of who we are,

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and how we relate
to the universe,

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and how the universe
relate to us.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
