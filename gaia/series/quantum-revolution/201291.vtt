00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a scientific
solution that can unite all

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
areas of science so they may be
understood holistically rather

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
than as separate
compartmentalized forces?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
In this series, Nassim Haramein
offers a fundamental model

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to unify all forces so
we as humanity can unlock

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of
our reality here

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and within
the universe at large.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.902 align:middle line:90%
But first, some context.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.346 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:10%
>> NASSIM HARAMEIN: Modern
physics has a fragmented view

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:10%
of our universe.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It thinks of our
universe as a set

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of equation, a set
of understanding that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:84%
describes the big stuff
and a whole different set

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
of understanding that
describe the small stuff.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:10%
Yet the universe is one thing.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And the small stuff
makes up the big stuff.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So there must be a unified
understanding of physics

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
In ancient knowledge,
in ancient civilization,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
in ancient wisdom, there
was that unified view.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It was usually in most of
these civilizations gathered

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
around one simple
principle, a principle that

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
said that, at the
base of creation,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
there is a fundamental energy.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:90%
They called it chi.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
They called it prana.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptian called it ka.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was the source
of all creation.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It was at the base of all
the physics we observe

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:90%
and the forces.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could happen
without that energy.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
The problem there
is that we started

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to divide all the
science into pieces,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
smaller and smaller
pieces so that scientists

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
could have a very high focus on
one little piece of the puzzle.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when we do
that is we lose the global view.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
We lose the holistic
view of the system.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We lose the
connection between all

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
of the pieces of the puzzle.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
understand how cosmology

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
affects biology, how
quantum theory affects

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:90%
awareness or consciousness.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So everything becomes
discontinuous.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We've lost the ability to have
a unified view of the mechanics

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of our universe, never mind a
unified view of our existence

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
in it or even of our
relationship with each other.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
We can do something over here.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's not affecting
anything over there

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not related, when

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
we see, in fact, in natural
system that everything

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
seems to be interrelated
and interconnected.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So in order to unify
physics, we must find what

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%
is the point of unification.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
ancient civilization had

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
this link between the two, had
this fundamental understanding

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of unification of
the forces of nature.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And it came from
this fundamental view

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that spacetime is an energy
that connects everything.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Think of space as being
full instead of empty.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And think of the stuff
in space as being

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
part of this fullness
of space, not something

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
separate but
something that emerge

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%
from this energy in space.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
In modern physics, we have all
these principles, these forces,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
for instance-- gravity,
electromagnetism,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the strong force,
the weak force.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But at the base
of modern physics,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing that explains
where these forces come from.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we have
no physics to describe

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
the origin of even the Big Bang,
the emergence of our universe,

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the emergence of
spacetime, never

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
mind what is the structure
of spacetime made of.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
To me, this was a big
hole in our understanding.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like we wrote
modern physics in mid-air

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
without a foundation,
without knowing

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
what's producing all this.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we try to
solve quantum equations

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
for the field at the very, very
fine level of the structure

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of space, we found that there
was almost infinite amount

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
of energy there.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And we called it
vacuum fluctuations.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little deceiving.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think
vacuum, you're thinking empty.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking full.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What science
has found is that,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the vacuum
at the very fine level

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum state, the vacuum
is fluctuating with an almost

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
infinite amount of energy, a
significantly large number--

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 93 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:10%
The vacuum density, better
known as the Planck density

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:10%
at the quantum
scale, is enormous.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:10%
10 to the 93 grams
per centimeter cubed

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:10%
is more than if we take all
the stars in the universe,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:10%
all the galaxies combined
and compress them down

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:10%
to 1 centimeter cubed.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how energetic
that would be.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: Well, that's
still 30 orders or 39 orders

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
of magnitude less dense than
the density of the energy

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
fluctuation at the state

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum in
the quantum world.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine if I looked at
all of the frequencies, all

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of the wavelength of all
the electromagnetic field

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in the space, in the
field between us.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to analyze,
where does it stop?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:10%
How short can the
wavelength get, right?

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I add all this
up in quantum field theory,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I get almost an infinite
amount of energy fluctuation

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in the space.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You could think of that
energy as a fundamental source

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
In certain words, in
certain tradition,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:90%
it could be called god.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:90%
It has all the same attributes.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
If you ask someone, what
would you describe god as?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Typically, they'll say,
omniscient, omnipotent.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It knows everything.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the creating power
of everything, right.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
If this energy is
there and it's truly

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the source of the
material world,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
then it could be
described as the god

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
force or the energy
that creates all

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:90%
of the world, all of creation.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The only difference, and this
is an important distinction,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is that the fluctuation,
the energy of this energy

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
is actually the result of
all things in the universe

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
interacting with each other.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming
from somewhere else.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It is the source of everything
interacting with each other

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
from infinitely big
to infinitely small.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a continuum of interaction.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is one thing.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
There is not matter
here and space here.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
There is this fundamental energy
in various dynamics of it,

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
producing the
effects that we see

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
as gravity, as matter,
as electromagnetism,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%
as electricity, and so on.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And so now we start
to get a unified view

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.395 align:middle line:90%
of this fundamental concept.

00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
When we analyze a
system in physics,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
we tend to assume
that this system is

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
isolated from all other
systems in the universe.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it creates this view
that is very artificial

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:90%
relative to the universe.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Because, for instance,
in the universe,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
we see a lot of evidence
of the contrary.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of evidence of
the universe producing order.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at a human
being for example.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
They're between 30
to 40 trillion cells,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
all functioning
together perfectly.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
They divided the rate
of 2.5 million cells

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
per second with 37,000 billion,
billion chemical reactions

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
every second managing
the entire body's system.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: Highly organized
thermodynamic carnal engine,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you burn that almost
100 degree Fahrenheit,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
24/7 for all of your life,
expanding energy in a very

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
coherent way.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Any variation of those
variables, any variation

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of your temperature of the
chemistry of your body and all,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're having a
really bad day, right.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
evidence of order.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Look at biology around the
planet, the interrelationship

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of all the species and all this
very complex, highly ordered

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's not isolated.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:90%
This system is not isolated.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:84%
When I calculate the
energy or efficiency

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
of a turbine in a
hydroelectric dam,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I calculate the
gravitational potential

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
of the water in
the lake above it.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I calculate the water going
down into the turbine and then

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the entropy of the
turbine transferring

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that gravitational
potential into electricity.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And then I assume this
to be a closed system.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:10%
And I say, oh, I have missed
one part of the equation.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And if I open the box, I take
the system out of isolation.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And I open the box.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I realize that the water
continues to go down the river.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And because the sun is shining
and the Earth is spinning,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:90%
the water is being evaporated.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it's raining
down or snowing down.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's flowing
back into my lake.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And now I realize there
is a continuous energy

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
exchange where I am only
looking, if I only look

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
at the turbine, at my little
device in that grader dynamics

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of the flow of creation.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Another way to understand
the interrelationship of highly

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
ordered systems is to
examine the concept of ether.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: Typically, when
we talk about ether in modern

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
physics, people are referring
to this ancient concept

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
of an ether that
has fluid dynamics.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's used by Newton
to describe gravity

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and, eventually,
James Clerk Maxwell

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to describe the electromagnetic
field, the Maxwell's equations.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:10%
That was discarded by
the Michelson and Morley

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:10%
experiments.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And that has no
validity anymore.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a problem in this
way this experiment was done.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:10%
That is an interferometer
with the precision that

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:10%
was able to achieve
at the time would not

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:10%
be able to detect an ether
that is occurring at the Planck

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:10%
scale, where we describe this
vacuum fluctuation occurring.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a scale that's billions
and billions and billions

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:90%
of times smaller than an atom.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The concept suggests
that, if there is ether,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
the drag of this ether should
be measurable as the Earth moves

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Think of frame dragging.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Frame dragging is an effect
on space time, predicted

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:10%
by Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:10%
that is due to non-static,
stationary distributions

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:10%
of mass energy.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:10%
A stationary field is one
that is in a steady state.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:10%
But the masses
causing that field

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:10%
may be non-static or
rotating, for instance.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: But imagine that,
if the drags of these frames is

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
very, very fine
near the surface,

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
it would be very
difficult to detect.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, do we know that the frames
are dragging, as in spacetime

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:90%
dragging behind the planet?

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:90%
We measured it now.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't measure it
with an interferometer

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the planet,
like Michelson and Morley.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We measured it
with a laser being

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
emitted from the surface of the
planet to a satellite in orbit

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
so that there would be enough
distance that we could measure

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:90%
the frame dragging.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And because the
ether was removed

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and spacetime was introduced
and then spacetime

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
predicted frame dragging and
we measured the frame dragging

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
but the frame
dragging measurements

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
was never reunified with
the concept of the ether.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So people in physics, when
they talk about ether,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
they think of this
thing that is ancient

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and that we don't use
anymore in physics.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, we both
have vacuum fluctuation

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum level
in physics that

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:90%
act very much like an ether.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have measured the frame
dragging of spacetime, which

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:90%
would be the drag of the ether.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So, just to be
clear, frame dragging

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that has been measured
in space time,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
frame dragging of
spacetime, may be actually

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
the drag of the ether
that we are measuring.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:90%
So people talk about space.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They talk about matter
in the space, right.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And then they talk about ether.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And they might even
talk about gravity

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:90%
being the curvature of space.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe, from what we
found, that, actually,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
all these things are
the same thing, right.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
When we look at matter,
what are we looking at?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're looking at
99.999999999 percent space,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So space and matter
is not very different.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:84%
There is only 0.000001 of a
percent difference than when we

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
look at what makes up
matter really closely,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
the stuff that's not the space.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
All we see is
electrostatic fields

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
or electromagnetic
fields interacting.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So, really, it's just all
space with electrostatic field

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
interacting.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And if the space is
not empty, then that

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
means that it's
all ether and that

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic or
electrostatic field that we

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
see as matter is just a function
of the dynamics of that ether

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and that gravity is the function
of that ether and so on.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's more
appropriate to describe it

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:10%
as quantum fluctuations.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So we can change
the terminology.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
fluctuations at the quantum

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
scales in the space that is
the source of everything.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard to
wrap your head around it

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
because we have a
tendency to isolate space

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
from matter, from
mass, from gravity,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%
from electromagnetic field.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:90%
We have all these little boxes.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
But what we're finding is
that all these box and we have

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:90%
solved these equations now.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to publish a whole
new set of equation that

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
are an expansion from earlier
equations that I wrote

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that solves all this, gives
the correct value for masses,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
for charge, for gravity,
for all the things

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
we see in the universe,
including galaxies, clusters,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
stars, universes,
and temperatures.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And so it's unified.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
We have solved this.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're about to publish it.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But, as well, the
center part has

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
been solved, showing that
there is no differences

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:90%
between these things.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get
mass without space.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get space
curving without mass.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get mass and space
without electromagnetic fields

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and that they're all connected
through this dynamic structure

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum
vacuum fluctuations.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:10%
So to understand
some of the intricacy

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:10%
that we're developed in the
beginning of quantum physics

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:10%
and the misconception
that emerged

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:10%
as a result of the lost
of this fundamental energy

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:10%
in the space, this ether,
one of the best example

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:10%
is the Copenhagen interpretation
of the double-slit experiment.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:10%
>> The Copenhagen interpretation
was first posed by physicist

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:10%
Niels Bohr in 1920.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:10%
It says that a quantum
particle doesn't

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:10%
exist in one state
or another but in all

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:10%
of its possible states at once.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:10%
It's only when we
observe its state

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:10%
that a quantum particle
is essentially forced

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:10%
to choose one probability.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the state
that we observe.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Since it may be forced into
different observable states

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
each time, this explains
why a quantum particle

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:90%
behaves erratically.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: So we were shooting
particles at the slit.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And we got one result
on the backboard

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
where the particles
were being recorded.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And we put two slits.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we got a different
result. All of a sudden,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
instead of particles,
it appeared like waves.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we tried to
put an instrument there

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out
what was happening

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:84%
with the particles that
was making those result.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And then we got a third result.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, all of a sudden,
there was confusion.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And because it was thought
that, all of a sudden,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
we don't know if a particle
can be a particle or a wave.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
measured, it changes them.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like all
this seems so unusual.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And, certainly, with the lost
of the concept of the ether,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:90%
it was not easy to explain.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is another
way to interpret

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
the double-slit experiment.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:10%
The fact that if you shoot
one particle at the slit,

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:10%
it makes little dots on the
backboard as if it's particle.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:10%
And then if you put two slits,
it makes wave interaction

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:10%
on the backboard as if there
was a wave all of a sudden,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:10%
is most likely
because, when you move

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:10%
a particle in a field
that acts like a fluid,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:10%
you're making waves.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the
particles that appears

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:90%
to be a particle and a wave.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:10%
This is thought to
be a theory that

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:10%
was developed by a great French
physicist Louis de Broglie

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:10%
that worked with Bohm as well
that Bohm brought forward

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:10%
as well later on.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And de Broglie
said, well, this can

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:90%
be described in fluid dynamics.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:10%
And it was called the
pilot-wave theory.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:10%
And so it was not
until, actually,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:10%
recently that was
realized, that if you

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:10%
put little beads of silicone
on a surface of silicone fluid

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:10%
and you shoot those beads
at the slit and put one slit

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:10%
and then you put two slit,
you'll get all the same result.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Just like a boat
on the ocean makes

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
wave when you have
two slits, the wave

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
goes through the second slit
and interact with the waves

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of the first slit.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it creates
interference pattern.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So, all of a sudden, instead
of all this quantum woo-woo,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
you can explain the
double-slit experiment

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
with simple fluid dynamics of a
fundamental ether in the space.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And the part in which,
when you make measurements,

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.360 align:middle line:84%
it changes it is
because anything

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that's in that vacuum
fluctuation field

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:90%
will make waves as well.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you put something
there to make the measurement,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
you're making
waves in the field.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So these waves
interact or interfere

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
with the waves of the particle.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And now you get a third
result. And so this all

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:84%
can be explained-- including
quantum tunneling and all

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the effects we see that led to
the Copenhagen interpretation

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
can be explained with pilot-wave
theory and the concept

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that space is not
empty and it's full.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, for some people that
are into consciousness study,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
awareness and all this,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
which uses the
double-slit experiment

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Copenhagen
interpretation

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to prove that consciousness
has an impact on matter,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that might seem discouraging
that all of a sudden,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, this was the
bad interpretation.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, it's just
because it's a fluid.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, it leads
to a better understanding

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
on how consciousness or
awareness can influence

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the field because it shows
that the field is influenced

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
by everything
influencing everything.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not consciousness
influencing

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the particle or the particle
influencing consciousness.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all influencing.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
All you have is this
fundamental field.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And when it moves, it changes
things, it modifies things.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And it produces forces.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And it produces masses.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And it does all this stuff.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to make clear
that I'm not just talking

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
about philosophically here.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
These equations
have been solved.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:90%
We can show this in experiment.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
We can see show that, now
with this new view when

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
we reintroduce
the ether in terms

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of quantum fluctuation
in the vacuum

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and we solve this equation,
now we start to describe,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:84%
we start to find the foundation,
the foundation of mass,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of gravity, the
foundation of electromagnetism,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Another example on how
physics get fragmented

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and then the pieces get lost
and not put back together--

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:90%
this is really important.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It's at the foundation
of our understanding

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
of quantum theory.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's now at the leading
edge of our understanding

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
of relativity.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And that is black
body radiation.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:10%
Quantum theory started
when, actually, Max Planck

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:10%
was trying to understand
the filament of a light bulb

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:10%
a little better so we could
make better light bulb.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
classical theory

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:84%
at the time to try to describe
the temperature or the heat

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
or the radiation that comes off
the filament of a light bulb.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And these earlier equations
said that the light bulb

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
should emit an infinite
amount of radiation

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:90%
in the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was deemed the
ultraviolet catastrophe.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a big problem.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck went at it
and tried to solve it.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:10%
And the only thing
you could come up with

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:10%
was adding this
weird fudge factor

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:10%
in the equation that
basically quantized

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:10%
the electromagnetic field or
the radiation of a black body.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:10%
>> All objects with the
temperature above absolute zero

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:10%
emit energy in the form of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:10%
A black body is a
theoretical or model body,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:10%
which absorbs all radiation
falling on it, reflecting

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:10%
or transmitting none.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a hypothetical
object, which

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect absorber and a
perfect emitter of radiation

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:90%
over all wavelengths.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: He found that, if
he added this little quantity,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
which eventually became
the Planck's constant,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it would quantized the radiation
or the heat coming off this

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
black body and give the correct
answer for the emission spectra

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of a light bulb.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And so he said--

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:90%
he published it.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:90%
He thought it was atrocious.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
He said it, hopefully,
there'll be a better solution

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
found because it was not
instinctively correct, right.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem right
because it basically

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
said that radiation comes
off in little packets that

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:90%
was quantized.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Einstein
used this concept

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
photoelectric effect where

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:84%
he said these little quantities
he called photons are knocking

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
electrons out of
semiconductors and creating

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
the electric effect
that we measure.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually what
Einstein got the Nobel Prize

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
This whole part of
physics in quantum theory

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:90%
developed independently.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Then the part in
which Einstein was

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
writing the equation
for gravity, which

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is called general
relativity, in that part

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:84%
of the equation, something
emerged that was similar

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
but that was found so far
removed from the black body

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
radiation of quantum
theory that it was never

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:90%
associated with it.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is that, when you solve
the Einstein field equations

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
at the cosmological
level, you find

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that spacetime can make
objects that are now

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
called black holes, which is
very similar to a box, that

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:90%
would absorb all the light.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
A black hole is a region of
space in which the density is

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
so high, the energy density
is so high that light cannot

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:90%
emerge from it.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.780 align:middle line:90%
It just falls in.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And so all light incident
on a black hole is absorbed.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like a black body, a black
hole is a perfect black body.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, when a
black hole absorbs,

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:84%
it radiates a little
bit of heat as well.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So it is like a black
body in quantum theory.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the black
holes were never

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
confirmed until the
early '90s, right.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Einstein didn't believe
they could exist.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Although his equation
predicted them,

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:10%
they were not called black
holes until John Wheeler coined

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:10%
them black holes,
which is much later.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So, basically,
these two concepts

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:90%
were never put together.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:84%
If science was not fragmented,
eventually these two

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
phenomenons would be put
together and realize,

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
wow, maybe the quantum world is
related to black hole physics.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe subatomic particles
are mini black holes.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
constant we use, which

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is Planck's constants,
which is based on black body

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
radiation, maybe this is why it
acts that way is because those

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.260 align:middle line:90%
are mini black holes.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you would start

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense that there
is a common relationship

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
between the subatomic world
and the cosmological world

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
black hole physics.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So this last example
is a very clear example

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
of how fragmented physics can
lead to fragmented thoughts

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
about our universe and divisions
between the small and the big.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
common thread there?

00:31:53.080 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The common thread is that maybe,
when we look at black holes,

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
when we look at
subatomic particles,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the dynamics of
the world from the very small

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
to the very big,
we're just looking

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
at the dynamics of a
spinning fluid of space,

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're just looking
at the ether dynamics

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
from very small to very big
acting in different ways

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
but all from the same source,
all from the same perspective.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What we call a black hole
according to Nassim Haramein is

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.120 align:middle line:84%
simply the center of the
vortex of a tornado of ether.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NASSIM: And depending
on the size of the vortex,

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that center singularity at the
center of that vortex is either

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
big and we sit in cosmology
or it's really small

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's a really
small vortex and we see it

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:90%
as a subatomic particle.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's all ether spinning.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part that we
have to understand better.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.910 align:middle line:10%
And, as we do,
then we can develop

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:10%
technology that will completely
transform our energy,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:10%
resources on our planet,
our capacity to survive,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:10%
some of these
larger difficulties

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:10%
that we are experiencing
today with our environment,

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:10%
with our population, and
with our understanding

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:10%
of each other of
the world around us

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:10%
and the universe as a whole.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So, in this series, we are
going to examine all these.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:90%
