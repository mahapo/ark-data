[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> How was our universe born?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Was it because of the Big Bang?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.545 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore
the question of cosmogenesis.

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Earlier, we described
spacetime as full of energy.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that this energy
is at the source of creation.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
We saw that the
equations we developed

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
showed that the
proton is basically

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
a vortex of this energy of
space, the vacuum fluctuation,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and that all the particles
and all the scales

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
are as well vortices of
this vacuum structure.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the equations that we
wrote that was very insightful

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
was the equation that
gived us the correct answer

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
for the vacuum density at
the cosmological level.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:10%
We briefly discussed
earlier that there

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:10%
is such a thing in physics
that is called the vacuum

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:10%
catastrophe.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Astrophysicists, when
they observe the universe,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
they see that the
universe is not just

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
expanding but it's
accelerating when it expands.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
In order to account
for that acceleration,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
they have to consider the
quantum vacuum fluctuation

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
at that scale.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:90%
They call it dark energy.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
When they put the vacuum
fluctuation, the dark energy

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
in, they can
calculate the density

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
of how much vacuum energy
is present to produce

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:90%
the expansion.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And they find the density
of 10 to the minus 30 grams

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:90%
per centimeter cubed.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost 122 orders
of magnitude difference

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
between the Planck
vacuum density

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and the cosmological vacuum.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
We wrote a paper resolving the
vacuum catastrophe last year.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:84%
In that paper, we show
that if we take a proton

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and we expand it to the
size of the universe,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
we find the correct vacuum
density for the universal size.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So to be clear, there
is a vacuum fluctuation

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:90%
in the proton.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The proton is a little
ball of Planck oscillators,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
billions of them,
10 to the 60th.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.417 align:middle line:84%
So it's a significantly
large number.

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:90%
They're spinning together.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And they have the
density of what

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:10%
is thought to be
the Planck density,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:10%
or a very high
density, 10 to the 93

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:10%
grams per centimeter
cube, which is the Planck

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:10%
density at the quantum scale.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>> This produced a lot of
debate in the physics community

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:10%
for decades.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's thought to be
one of the biggest

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
errors in physics,
this discrepancy of 122

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:90%
orders of magnitude.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It created a lot of debate
and as well a certain amount

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
of lack of confidence of the
understanding of physics,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's at the cosmological
level or at the quantum level.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
The vacuum catastrophe is one of
the largest problem in physics.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists say
it has to be very dense.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And cosmologists say it
has to be very low density.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:90%
So this is very powerful.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But what does it mean
about our universe?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean about
the birth of our universe?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Why are protons in
our universe not

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
expanding to the size of
the universe right now?

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Why did one proton
all of a sudden

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
expand to the size
of the universe?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And that proton
might have started

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
as a Planck expanding to a
proton expanding to a universe.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang Theory actually
starts with a Planck size

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
singularity expanding to
the size of the universe

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:90%
extremely rapidly.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called inflation where the
universe in the first Planck

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
second expands to almost
the size it is today.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So it expands at billions,
trillions of times

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:90%
faster than the speed of light.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that the right picture?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear
that it is correct.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
There is many discrepancies
in the standard model.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of them being
that the source of energy

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
for the expansion of the
universe, the source of energy

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
for that Planck to all
of a sudden explode

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
into all of time
and space and all

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
of the matter in the universe,
has not been described.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no mechanism
that explains

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
how the Planck-sized
object all of a sudden

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:90%
just exploded into a universe.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is no explanation
where the energy

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
came from for this to happen.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
With the model that
we've developed now,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
which gives the correct
answers for the mass

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and for the acceleration and so
on, we get a different picture.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
From the equations we wrote
and what we discussed before,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
we know that the universe
is scaling from the Planck

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
scale or even the sub-Planck
scale to the atomic scale

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- planets,
stars, galaxies, clusters,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:84%
super clusters, and
universes, all this

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:90%
giving the correct answer.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
When we think of
this then, we can

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
think that our universe
then is an object very

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:90%
akin to a black hole.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And we can show that
in the equations,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
because when we get
the temperature,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
we get the temperature which
is equivalent to the Hawking

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:90%
radiation of a black hole.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So we know our universe
is a black hole.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It has a correct mass and radius
exactly to be a black hole.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, and
we see that there

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
an exchange between the
interior of a black hole

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and the exterior of
the black hole, which

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
is what we are finding
in our equation,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that black holes
are not isolated,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that there is
information falling in

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
information expanding out

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of black holes because of
their angular momentum,

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
then we could think that
our universe is not singular

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
but that our universe is
part of many other universes

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
in a larger one, because
the scaling tells us this.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that our universe
is part of many universes

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:90%
that are--

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
think of bubbles together
in a larger universe,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
an extremely large
universe, which

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
could be a bubble
that's together

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
with other bubble of that
size in the larger universe

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
just like galaxies are
inside our universe.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, all this tells
us something profound.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That is that our
universe might be

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the result of a proton or
a singularity, a Planck

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
singularity, that
escaped another universe,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:90%
another bubble.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> To restate what
Hawking radiation,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
is Hawking radiation says
that vacuum fluctuations near

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
the event horizon can produce a
pair of particles in which one

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
particle is radiated out of
the black hole and one particle

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:90%
falls into the black hole.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So imagine a particle at the
surface of the event horizon

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
of a universal black hole of
about our size that radiates

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:90%
a particle out.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
When that particle arrives
in the larger universe,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum density of
the larger universe

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
is many, many
orders of magnitude

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
lower than the Planck density
that that particle is made of.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The result is that
that particle would

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
expand very rapidly
to make a proton,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:90%
eventually to make a universe.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And as it expands,
it would as well

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
exchange information and
change particle due to Hawking

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
radiation and change
its dynamics inside.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine the expansion
of such a bubble very,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:84%
very rapidly producing
vorticular dynamics,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
change in density in the
system, and vorticular dynamics

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that eventually would make
quasars, galaxies, clusters,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
super clusters, stars,
planets, and eventually us.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a completely
different view of creation.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine the
surface of bubble universes

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
radiating these particles
and these particles

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
popping into or expanding into
new universes like foaming

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:90%
new universes into existence.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
This vacuum fluctuation
has even been called

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:90%
quantum foam for a long time.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The foaming of creation resemble
much more a biological dynamic.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Cosmogenesis then is the
result of changes in density

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
when the particle
escapes a universe.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:10%
But don't just think of this
being localized to the bubble

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:10%
universes of our size.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that other
universes, very large ones,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
that are part of the
multiverse, so the universe,

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
for instance, in
which we are, which

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
could be a universe that has a
density in which our universe

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to a
proton for that universe.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine that universe
birthing another universe

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of its own size as well.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It would mean as well that
our universe will eventually

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
stabilize at a certain
radius when equilibrium will

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
be achieved between the
inside of our universe

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and the outside of our
universe so that there

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is a state of
equilibrium at the event

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:90%
horizon of the black hole.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So that means that our
universe at one point

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
would reach a point
of equilibrium

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
with the larger
universe it's in.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we would
see is a slowing down

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
or stopping of the expansion.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:10%
Now I want to talk a
little bit about expansion

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:10%
and acceleration
in our universe.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It may be that the dynamics
of expansion of our universe

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
have been simplified
a little too much.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They can be more
complex dynamics

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in our universe than what
we previously thought.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
That is when the
universe expanded,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of
the fluid structure

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime in
our universe would

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
produce vorticity locally but
as well globally, collectively,

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:90%
for all of the universe.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So the universe would
have a structure.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be
completely amorphous.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It would have a structure.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:90%
It would have polarity.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And it would have a double
tourist type of structure

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:90%
a little bit like galaxy.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Think of a galaxy the size
of our universe with its jet

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and with its disk.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
We've started to see
some of those structures

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We've we found places where it's
much denser and super clusters.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like a wall.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We found places where we
call it the dark flow where

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:90%
there's very little.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, that would be--

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
think of the arms of the
galaxy at the universal level.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
There would be region
with more material, region

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:90%
with less material.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And there would be a definite
flow like in galaxies

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
where star goes from the center
out to the edge into the halo

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy up at the
poles and then come back down

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
in this toroidal dynamic
with the jets in the middle.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:10%
And there would be polarity
to our universe in such a way

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:10%
that we might find that
there's matter that's

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:10%
spinning in one direction
and matter that's spinning

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:10%
in the other direction.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And that is what we found.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
We found that matter can spin
in the opposite direction

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ordinary
matter that we see.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And we call that antimatter.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:10%
And this was a consequence of
the Dirac equations discovering

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:10%
the electron antimatter
particle or the positron.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So this dynamic would,
in the universe,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
would move things
in certain ways

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
in which an observer, a
teeny weeny little observer

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
like us might think that the
universe radius is expanding,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
which could be the case,
which most likely is the case.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But this could be
combined with the movement

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of the material inside
the universe, which

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
would appear to us as
material accelerating away.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a more complex
view of the motion of stars

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
relative to each
other but as well

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies relative to
each other and structures

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:90%
relative to each other.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We're finding,
for instance, that

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
quasars in our universe and
certain region all align very

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
precisely to one very
specific direction.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Quasars have these
massive jets that

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
come out of it like
these huge vortices which

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
are evidence of this fluid
dynamics spinning structure

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But these huge jets can be
a million light years long.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And they all seem to align
in this very specific region

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that might
be because they're

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
close to the polar vortices
of our universe itself.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they tend to,
if they're not aligned,

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
they would tend to
slowly align to that pole

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
as they approach the
polarity of our universe.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's things like that are
puzzling the current physics

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
community that start
to be understood better

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:90%
with this new model of physics.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Just recently-- this has been
an ongoing investigation since

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
the '90s as I can remember it--

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.220 align:middle line:84%
we have noticed as well that
light polarization moving

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
through our universe is
by birefringent or acts

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
like it's moving
through a crystal.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
There is lots of evidence
of it in many ways.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Think of like the structure
of spacetime aligning

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:10%
to a universal
frame of reference,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:10%
a universal polarized field.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And this leads to belief that
this vacuum structure is not

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
only organized by spin but
that spin as well produce

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:90%
polarization.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:10%
So this is called quantum
vacuum polarization.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And from this
polarity our equations

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:10%
tells us that these magnetic and
electromagnetic field emerges.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:10%
It's a completely different
view of our universe.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a view where
the universe is not

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
some random bubble that's
just producing random effects,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's highly organized.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:90%
It's polarized.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one universe.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's part of many, many
universe that are being created.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's inside a larger
universe and a larger universe.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
When you tell a child
about the Big Bang Theory,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and you say it all started with
a big explosion, typically,

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
the first thing a child
will think of or ask

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
will be what was there
before the explosion.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this new view
tells us that the universe

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:90%
is fractal in nature.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's fractal in scales.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's an infinite
amount of scales

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
producing an infinite
amount of creative path

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:90%
that we call universe.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And this evolution is very
specific to the coordinates

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
in spacetime in
which it's happening.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it
as very individualized

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
but part of the oneness
of the infinite nature

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
of the fractal
structure of spacetime.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Initially, Georges
Lemaitre, a Belgium cosmologist

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:10%
and Catholic priest, argued
that the physical universe was

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:10%
originally a single particle,
the primeval atom as he called

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:10%
it, which disintegrated in an
explosion giving rise to space

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:10%
and time and the expansion of
the universe that continues

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:10%
to this day.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea marked the
birth of what we now

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:90%
know as big bang cosmology.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Later on, cosmologists
realized that an atom was not

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a good start, that it would more
likely be a Planck-sized object

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that expanded to
eventually produce

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
all the time and space
and all the matter

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
we see in the universe.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> However, none of these
scenarios gives us a clear

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
understanding of why and
atom would all of a sudden,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or a Planck-size object all of a
sudden would expand to the size

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:90%
of a universe.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:90%
What is the energy?

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Where did the energy come from
for that to have happened?

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
What is the mechanics that
made it happen and so on.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Our equation shows something
similar but different.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It gets rid of this idea of an
explosion, this idea of a bang.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It actually shows that it's
basically scalar relationship

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:90%
of radiation of black hole.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:10%
So imagine our universe
as a black hole.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And it has Hawking radiation.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So the vacuum fluctuation,
the Plank vacuum fluctuation

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
near the event horizon
produced particles.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And these particles, one of
them can radiate and one of them

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:90%
can fall in.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:84%
When a particle radiates into
the larger universe, the larger

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
black hole that our black
hole universe is in,

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
the density of that
larger black hole

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
is much, much, much smaller,
orders and orders of magnitude

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
smaller density
than our universe.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So when it escapes the
black hole universe

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're in into
the larger black hole,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the density change will make
it expand very, very rapidly.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And this mechanism
is what we believe

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually the source of
the expansion of the universe

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or what we have typically
called the Big Bang.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Ancient civilizations
had very similar thoughts

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:90%
about the universe.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
They thought about
the universe as having

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
information that
could be contained

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:90%
in every atom in the universe.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Many different civilizations
around the world

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
had this in their folklore
in their traditions.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They thought of the universe
as being just one universe

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
part of many others.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They talked about our universe
as continuously expanding,

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:90%
or changing, or evolving.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:10%
And when they talked about
where they got this knowledge,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:10%
they said they got it from sun
gods from being from the stars,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:10%
from the gods that
instructed them

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:10%
on the structure of the
universe, and how it works,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting that
at this time in history,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be finding very
similar concepts emerging

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
in advanced physics, the concept
of a holographic universe

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
where every point contains
all the information and so on,

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the concept of scaling
universe, fractal structures

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%
in the universe and multiverses.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
All this seemed to be known
by many ancient civilizations

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
around the world thousands of
years prior to modern physics.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:10%
Were they instructed by advanced
being that they had contact

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:10%
with at the time?

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:10%
But definitely
there is an analog

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:10%
between what we
are finding today

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and what ancient
civilization knew

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:10%
from whether it was direct
contact with advanced knowledge

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:10%
or from their spiritual
exploration, which

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:10%
may have led them to understand
the universe by the study

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:10%
of their own beings since if
the universe is a holographic,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:10%
each point contains the
whole, all information

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:10%
should be available to
every being in the universe.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Remember in earlier
episode when we

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
entanglement of particles

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:84%
where two particles leaving
one atom will be entangled

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and how particles are
most likely all entangled

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
because they all came from
the same source, which I just

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
described being a
proton or a Planck

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
leaving another universe.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%
So everything is entangled.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, that means that as
well all of these universes

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:10%
are entangled because they
all emerged from one another.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:90%
So all the scales are entangled.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
All the universes are entangled.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
However, they are developing
independently from each other.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And the information is moving
through the whole system

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in a very complex way.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So you could think
that the entanglement

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is out there
that our universe has created

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
would have some of the
information about you

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and I and everything
we see here that I

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:90%
could go to another universe.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And if I got the
right source, I could

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
learn about what's going on here
and that they may be something

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what's going
on here that's happening over

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
there but a little
bit different,

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's
getting a little bit

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
different set of
information because it's

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
in different coordinates
of spacetime.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
In an infinite
fractal universe, it's

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
important to understand that
every point is the center.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So you could say I'm the
center of the universe.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
However, there would be a larger
universe that our universe is

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
in, and a larger universe that
our universe is in, and so on.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I
could find a universe

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:90%
that I'm in the center of.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to remember
that every other point is

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:84%
the center of their
own universe as well.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise you'd get in trouble.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, individualization
and the oneness

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
of infinite fractal
universe occurs

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because each point
observed the universe

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:84%
from its own
perspective and gathers

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:84%
different sets of
information, and so

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
is there an exact copy of
me in a parallel universe?

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I would say no.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:10%
But they may be
a information set

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:10%
very similar or in resonance
with my information set

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:10%
in another universe due to
the entanglement relationship

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:10%
of all the universes together.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
