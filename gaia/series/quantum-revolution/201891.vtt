[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> A world shifting view
is about to take place.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
explore what that is.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:10%
>> In the current worldview,
there is a limited amount

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
of resources.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:10%
There is a limited
amount of energy.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a limited amount
of land that we fight for.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Systems always go
towards disorder.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:10%
We can never get more energy
out of a system than the energy

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:10%
we put in.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:90%
So we are always deficient.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And the survival of our
species is very much

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
challenged by the result of our
activity on our environment.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a world shift
view that's occurring.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We are discovering that there
is an abundant amount of energy.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There is a source
of energy we didn't

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
know was there, just like
Faraday in the earlier time

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
discovered that by moving a
magnet cross a coil he could

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
get a source of energy we
called the electric field that

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:90%
was unknown before.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We are now realizing
that there is

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
a source of energy at
the basis of creation

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that is fluctuating
at the quantum scale

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
that we could have access
to, and that everything

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:90%
emerged from and returned to.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And this world shift
view has a deep meaning

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to all of our lives, to the
understanding of who we are,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and how we came to be,
and what is our role

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to play in this great
wildworks of nature.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this
energy can be accessed

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
through technological
development in a laboratory

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
if our world turned
its eyes towards it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and put the effort and the
resources needed towards it.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
The result will be a very
fundamental change in the way

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
we do business, in the way our
financial structures function,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
in the way we interact with
the world and the universe.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But this energy as well is the
energy that runs you currently.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
In these episodes we
discuss how it may actually

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
be the energy that
you call consciousness

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:90%
that animates you every day.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
You can be a participant
in this transformation,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
in this change in worldview,
in your own individual way

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
by learning to interact
with this energy,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of this energy,
by connecting to it, by growing

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and transforming.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Because when every individual
transform, the world transform.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Changing the world means
changing you, primarily.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And then the world will change.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Becoming aware of this
energy, becoming aware

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that you are animated
by it, becoming aware

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness is
not limited to the brain

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
activity of your body, but that
your consciousness can extend

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to an infinite potential
within every atom of your body

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and that you are connected
to a network of information

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
across all scales
in the universe

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:84%
transforms your view and
your worldview to a worldview

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of abundance, of infinite
amount of energy,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of infinite amount of
information available to you.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And it brings you into
that place of coherency

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have described as a
place where masters reside.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
The master is within you.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
All of the masters
that walk the world

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
have talked about
accessing this energy.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked about how all
beings have this potential

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
to be the master.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
By the discovery
of these mechanics,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
by the discovery
of these physics,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
we can bring each individual
to become the most

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
powerful, the most incredible,
and the most profound being

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
interacting with itself and with
the world in such a way that

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is productive, generative,
transformative for the whole.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
The technologies
that are emerging

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
from this discovery of the
Planck vacuum structure

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and the new physics
that comes with it

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
are going to change
many of the way we

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
think of our self and
the world as well.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
When you have technology that
demonstrates to you that there

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
is an infinite amount of energy,
that you can go and orbit

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter for the weekend, it's
not outside the possibilities,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need to burn
millions of tons of fuels

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to get there, you can
imagine the transformation

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that will happen in the
consciousness of people.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
However, in order for
these technologies

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to emerge into a world, the
world must get ready for it.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness have to be
there in order to technology

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to be thought of,
to be defined, to be

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:90%
engineered into our world.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It is up to each
one of us, then,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to learn about this new
understanding of the structure

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum and the dynamics
of creation that eventually

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
animates each one of us.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to
transform ourself in order

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that we can see this
potential within ourself,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and then, eventually,
apply it to the world,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:90%
so that we can support it.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Every single individual
that has this realization

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that they are interacting
with the field

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and that that field is part of
them and transforming them--

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
every individual that
makes that transformation

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is supporting the emergence
of this type of science

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and technology into the world.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
However, the
technology emerging--

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that is, for instance,
overunity becoming available

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
will change the
consciousness as well.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We just need front
leaders that can

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
see the vision of
this happening,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
so that it's supported
and it can happen.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The masses will see
this technology.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And it will transform
their consciousness

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
because of the mechanics
that is being demonstrated

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:90%
to them at that time.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
For instance, it's well
known that astronauts

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that go up in space and see
the world from space change

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
their perspective, change their
understanding of humanity,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and come back transformed
from these experiences.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So it is a feed forward
feedback between the technology

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness must be able
to visualize it, understand it,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
understand the
physics, the mechanics.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
And then the technology
help our consciousness

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
actualize this new
understanding in our world

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and transform our
understanding even

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
at the deeper level as
we experience the benefit

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of these type of technology.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is the dynamics
of the universe

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
at all scale expressing
itself in our society.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It is, thus, critical
that every one of you

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
individually make
an effort to bring

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
this understanding
and these new dynamics

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and to support this
effort in your own life

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and to support it
outside of yourself

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
with all these different
organizations that are working

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:90%
on these type of things.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It must become the
most important endeavor

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific community
in the world today.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
If you are a scientist
and you can help,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
then that's one
way you can help.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But everybody must help
by changing themselves.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
When we change ourself,
we change the world.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The change that people
can make in their own life

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is to become aware
of this energy,

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to become aware that they are
interacting with the field,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that they're not isolated,
that there is no isolated

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
system, that everything they do
affects everything, that they

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
have a responsibility in what
they think, what they say,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
how they do it, what
they do around them.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:90%
This is critical.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
If we realize this
in our life, our life

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
looks vastly different.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We realize that we have
an influence on what

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is occurring around
us, that we are not

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
isolated in our relationship
to the universe-- is

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:90%
almost infinite.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
That what we think and how
we think and what we do

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and how we do it is
influencing the whole.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we become very much
aware of everything we do.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:10%
We have a sense
of responsibility

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:10%
of what goes on in our world,
but as well of what goes on

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:10%
in our life.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
As well, we develop
a sense of gratitude

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
for the amazing
opportunity to be

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
part of this great development
of the universe learning

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
about itself through our
thoughts, our interpretation,

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:90%
our discoveries.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
This realization transforms
an individual life

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
at the deepest level,
and as well, supports

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and helps to transcend
some of the limitation

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have self-imposed
by a misunderstanding

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental
mechanics of our universe.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The event of this
new understanding

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and the development of the
technology that comes with it

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
will change the way countries
interact with each other.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It will change the way humanity
interacts with each other.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:84%
The source of energy
being almost infinite,

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to have almost
infinite amount of resources

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:84%
by being able to go
to the asteroid belt

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to get anything we want, or
to find it on another planet,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
or to even have terraforming
of other planet, and so on,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
will eliminate the
stressors that currently

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:90%
keeps our world at war--

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there is not
enough energy for everybody,

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that there is not
enough resources,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that there is not
enough land, and so on.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And the fighting
and the infighting

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that goes on as a result
of this will disappear.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The source of energy
being extracted directly

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
out of the structure
of space-time

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
with almost an infinite
amount of energy available

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and the capacity to
control this energy

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to produce gravitational effects
and gravitational control

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
will free humanity from
the sense of scarcity

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that leads to war and
fighting for resources

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:90%
that are required for survival.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a dramatic change
in our understanding

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and our interaction
with each other

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that was actually predicted
by many ancient civilization

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:90%
that it would occur.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:10%
It was always interpreted as a
very philosophical concept that

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:10%
is thought to be that society in
a certain period of time, which

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:10%
was mapped by calendars
in ancient time--

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:10%
there would be a world shift.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:90%
And that humanity would ascend.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And that war would end.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And that the world would
regain its natural beauty.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And that we would
live in Eden again.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is where we
are arriving as a society

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
today as we are discovering
this new source of energy.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the world
ascending was just meaning

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
in ascension in consciousness.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:10%
But it is, as well,
a literal ascension

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:10%
as we discover
control of gravity

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:10%
and we birth a society
into a space colony.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And the result of
this development

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding
and in the technology

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
based on the rediscovery of
this fundamental energy--

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
the mana, the ether,
and so on that

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
was described by these
ancient civilization--

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
the end of warring, the end
of infighting, and so on.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
That was described as these
thousands of years of peace

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that we would enter into during
this new period in history.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That was defined in
this region of our time

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:90%
today by ancient calendars.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
This prediction that we would
enter a time of peace because

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of this ascension,
which I believe

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
is the result of gravity
control being discovered

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of the
vacuum that will give us

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
an infinite amount of energy,
is consistent across all

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:84%
of these different
cultures around the world.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It's even mentioned in the
Bible in the Book of Revelation

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that we would eventually
reach that point

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:90%
after a period of great chaos.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the point at
which I think we are.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of
these new physics

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and the technological
development that comes from it

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:90%
will lead us there.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The birth of this new worldview
may be a little bit difficult

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
as we transform our morses and
our structure in our society.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it may be a little
bit of a painful birth.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
we will achieve

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:90%
this in the next few decades.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm very enthusiastic.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very excited
about this transformation.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I have been working
on this for some 30 years.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:90%
I am not the only one.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
There is many different
inventors and scientists

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
all around the world now
that are picking up the ball

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and are running with it.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There is much efforts that are
being made in many laboratories

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
around the world to
develop this technology.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
However, it still
needs much more support

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
from the financial structure and
from the scientific community

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%
to emerge into our world.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:90%
But we are very close.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:10%
In my laboratory, personally, I
have worked on gravity control.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I have worked on
overunity devices.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have worked on
life extension devices

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
all from the result
of extracting

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of energy from
the structure of the vacuum.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
We've been successful in
some of these endeavors.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
We are still working on some
of these endeavors as well.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
However, the support is
required at this time, not just

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
the support financially, which
is, of course, necessary,

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because doing physics at a
high level is fairly expensive.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly
as well, the support

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
by the scientific
community to help us

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
continue to flesh
out these equations

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and look at their consequences
and their new understanding

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy and proud to say
that we have an amazing team

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:90%
of physicists working with us.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And we are advancing
very rapidly now,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
as we have discovered some
of the fundamental links

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
between thermodynamics angular
momentum, energy, mass,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
geometry, and most
importantly, gravity and all

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
of the forces of nature.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And these math, so
far, are very precise.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And they give very clear
and simple understanding

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:90%
of these mechanics.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
However, as we develop
these math and the map

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
gets larger and larger,
there is so much more

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to explore and so many
details to explore that it's

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:90%
becoming overwhelming.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And we need the support of
the scientific community

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to help us with this.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So personally, I think we
have moved forward and made

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
great strides in developing both
the theory and the technology.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:90%
And we are very, very close.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We need the support
of every individual

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
out there to make it
happen and to allow it

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
to be birthed into our world.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
This new understanding
of who we are,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
discovering that we're emerging
from a flow of information

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum scale that has
cohered all of the biology

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
into existence,
to this complexity

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually our
body, and discovering

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the deep, incredible, infinite
information network that we're

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
part of gives us, as
well, a view of our role

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to play in the universal
structure learning

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:90%
about itself.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
We have a role to play as
an individual in the world.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a role to play as a
human endeavor in the galaxy.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a responsibility
to the evolution

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of our universe as individual
and as a collective

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
To realize this
responsibility, we

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
must first realize
our connection

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to all there is through
this new understanding

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:90%
of the physics of creation.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:90%
We are in a new time.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Our level of consciousness
is rising very rapidly.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Where before there was a lot of
resistance to these new idea,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:10%
more and more people
are opening up to them,

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:10%
including in the
scientific community.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they need
the goods to believe it.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And the equations are there.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving
the correct answers.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And that will help.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we develop the
technology and the technology

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:84%
is confirmed, then
that will help as well.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a shift
in consciousness

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:90%
that's happening globally.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's emerging in
all of the fields,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
from financial structures,
military structures,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
scientific institutions,
and many different fields,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
all fields of investigation
and discovery in the world.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
changing very rapidly.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost hard
to keep up with it.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So I am very optimistic
in this transformation

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to happen in the
next decade, and

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific community
will soon allow this revolution

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
to occur in our
world and actually

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
get on board with this
new field of investigation

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
called vacuum engineering or
quantum vacuum engineering.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a bright
future for humanity.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:90%
It's right there in front of us.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:90%
We're very close now.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't despair.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:10%
I know that when you look
at the 5 o'clock news

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:10%
or you look at the
political debates

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:10%
you might get very discouraged
and feel that there is no hope,

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:10%
or if you look at the data
for some of the events that

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:10%
are occurring in our biological
environment and our challenges.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:90%
But there is a solution.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:90%
We are very close to it.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We are very close to
transforming our world

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
into something remarkable.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what is important
to keep our eyes on and keep

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
going for that amazing
transformation,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
for that amazing world that
we can develop together.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And let all of the rest go,
because it will work itself

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
As long as we keep our eyes on
this goal, we will achieve it.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
A revolution in physics
is about to occur.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And you are part of it.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm Nassim Haramein.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
