00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the
holographic principle,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and how did it emerge?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.470 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we look at how
to access the infinite field

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.261 align:middle line:90%
of information in our universe.

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:24.109 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The holographic principle
has been present throughout

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
the ages, although it may have
not been called that way early

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
on.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
The concept that everything
is present in everything,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that from any point or
any part of the universe,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
you could get the
information of the whole,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:84%
has been present in ancient
civilization traditions,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
shamanism, and masters
around the world

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:90%
in many different cultures.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The concept of oneness
has been there all along.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:10%
However, in the development
of the holographic principle

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:10%
in standard physics, we
start the exploration

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:10%
with a famous
physicist, David Bohm,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:10%
which thought of the implicate
and explicate order of creation

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:10%
as this structure
in which creation

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:10%
contained every piece of
information of the whole

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:10%
in every point.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Every region contains the total
structure unfolded within it.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
He thought that all of the
information of the universe

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:90%
would be present in every point.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was described
is his exploration

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of the holographic
principle early on.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a hologram?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
A hologram is an
experiment or a setup

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
in order to get a
three-dimensional projection

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand
the holographic principle

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of physics is called that
way only as an analogy.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is where people get
mixed up, including physicists.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to make
a very distinct separation

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
between a hologram that
we may call on Earth here

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and the universe having
a holographic principle.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Those are two different things.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
However, the hologram
is a good analogy

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to most likely what
the universe is doing.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> To produce a hologram, a
laser beam is split into two

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
identical beams and redirected
by the use of mirrors.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the split beams is
directed at the object--

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
in this example, an apple.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Some of the light is reflected
off the object directly

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
onto the photographic plate.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The second beam is directed
onto the photographic plate.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And when the two beams intersect
and interfere with each other,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the interference pattern
recreates a virtual 3D image

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:90%
of the apple in this space.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
word "hologram"

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
Greek word "holos"--

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
whole, or "grama"-- message.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
If a hologram is
cut into pieces,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
each piece contains
whole views of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%
the entire holographic image.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's really amazing and
interesting about this is that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
if you cut the plate in half
and shoot the laser at it,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
the apple is still
going to appear.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have
lower resolution,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:90%
but it's still going to appear.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you cut it in quarter
and you should the laser at it,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
it's still going
to have the apple.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
All the information
is still there.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
You can cut, theoretically,
the plate to infinity

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and still have the
information of the apple.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So the concept is that every
point contains the whole, which

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is a concept, as I
said, that was already

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
present in ancient civilization
all around the world,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:90%
in shamanic cultures and so on.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:10%
Physics develop in such
a way that we discovered

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:10%
that there is this possibility
in the universe that

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:10%
black holes could form.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
puzzling for physicists.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:10%
Einstein's filled
equations predicted

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:10%
that black holes could form.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:10%
Einstein himself didn't
believe it could exist.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:10%
He thought that part of
the equation is wrong.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
All the rest is working
out, but most likely,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%
a black hole cannot form.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the word "black
hole" wasn't even coined.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
It was called a singularity.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is the foundation of the
solution to Einstein's field

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called the Schwarzschild
solution to the Einstein field

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The Schwarzschild solution
is the primary solution

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to Einstein field equation
used to describe and calculate

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
gravity or orbitals
of planets and stars.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's very much
present, but it mostly ignored,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
the part in which the mass of
an object could have a density

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
so high that the light could
not even escape from it.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
However, when black
holes were discovered--

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
but even before,
when exploration

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
about that part of Einstein
field equation was done--

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
there was something puzzling.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
If light is falling
into a black hole,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
if information is falling
into a black hole--

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
so you can think of information
and information theory

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
as particles falling into the
black hole like photons that

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
could carry information about
their velocity, their position,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
particles as information

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:90%
in information theory.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct and analog
between information and energy.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Then where is the
information going?

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
When it goes into the black
hole, where does it end up?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:10%
If the black hole
can evaporate--

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:10%
and this is something that
was the result of some

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:10%
of the exploration that Stephen
Hawking did on black holes.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called
Hawking radiation.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Hawking predicted that energy
fluctuations from the vacuum

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
cause the generation of
particle-anti-particle pairs

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of virtual particles
near the event

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%
horizon of the black hole.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the particles
falls into the black hole

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
while the other escapes before
they have the opportunity

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:90%
to annihilate each other.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The net result is that to
someone viewing the black hole,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
it would appear that a
particle had been emitted.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Since the particle that is
emitted has positive energy,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the particle that gets
absorbed by the black hole

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
has negative energy relative
to the outside universe.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This results in the black hole
losing energy and thus mass.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Smaller primordial
black holes can actually

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
emit more energy
than they absorb,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
which results in
them losing net mass.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Larger black holes, such as
those that are one solar mass,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
absorb more cosmic
radiation than they

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:90%
emit through Hawking radiation.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if it's losing energy
and information is falling

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
in, where is the
information going to end up?

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Where is it going?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the standard
model of cosmology,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
which was Hawking's
opinion and others,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:90%
is that the information is lost.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
But that violates some of the
foundations of physics in which

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
information cannot be
lost in quantum theory.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:90%
And this was a big problem.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:10%
There was what is commonly
described as the black hole

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:10%
information war that developed
between quantum physicists

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:10%
and cosmologists,
some saying, no,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:10%
the information is just lost,
some saying all the information

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:10%
end up in a parallel
universe somewhere else,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:10%
and quantum physicists saying,
no, information cannot be lost.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:10%
The two main characters
of this black hole war

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:10%
was Stephen Hawking
and Leonard Susskind,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:10%
which is the director of the
Physics Department at Stanford

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:10%
University.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:10%
And the two were debating what
happens to the information

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, with the
help of other physicists,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Leonard Susskind,
from little bit

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of a convoluted path
of earlier physics that

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
were written by
Bekenstein and others,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:84%
develop a concept
that is now known

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:90%
as the holographic principle.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This concept showed that
the information that's

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
falling into the black
hole is holographically

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
imprinted on the surface of
the black hole as Planck vacuum

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%
fluctuation.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And here is our ether again at
this nice, centrally position,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
again reemerging, showing
that the information

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is held in the
structure of the vacuum

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
at the surface of
the black hole.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So it is not lost.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics
were written for it,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and it give the
correct temperature

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
for the entropy
of the black hole,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
for the temperature
of the black hole.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it was proven
to be correct,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
or at least it has been
theorized to be correct.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Stephen
Hawking conceded the bet

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that information
could be retained

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the black hole,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and the information
was not lost.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:10%
So Leonard Susskind and
the holographic principle

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:10%
became explored more and more
by many, many physicists,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:10%
and the concept became
very much embedded

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:10%
in the modern interpretation
of black hole entropy

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:10%
and some of the most
advanced and most important

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:10%
mathematics and physics that
are being explored today,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:10%
including er equals epr,
showing that entanglement

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:10%
may be through black holes
and that black holes are

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:10%
like little--

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:10%
entangled by particles,
saying that particles

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:10%
may be as well black holes.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:10%
But before we jump
into all this,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:10%
the holographic
principle is something

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:10%
that I had developed
in a different way

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:10%
from the early physics
that I had come up with.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I had realized that this
Planck field, this ether

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is made out of teeny
oscillators at the Planck scale.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
them as discreteness,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
granular structure of
spacetime, that Einstein

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
was correct to think
that spacetime curved

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
to produce gravity,
but spacetime

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:90%
is only smooth at large scale.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
When you look closely, just
like water in our tub--

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the water
going down the drain,

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
it appears smooth, but
when you look closely,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
it's made out of atoms,
which is granular.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime was made of
these granular structures.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had come up with a little
bit the same interpretation

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of the holographic principle
from a different perspective.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, I had realized
that the granular structure

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime is
not a 2D surface as

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
in the current
holographic principle,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
but that the grains are little
spheres, little particles.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just on the
surface of the black hole,

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was on the interior
of the black hole.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime and the
vacuum structure

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
is not excluded from the
inside of the black hole.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So I started to think about
this holographic principle

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and the granular
structure of spacetime,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
the granular structure
of the vacuum fluctuation

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
being this dynamic spin
that produce particles--

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
most importantly, the center
of the atom, the proton.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Think of the proton in
the nucleus of the atom

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
as being the center of
the vortex of spacetime

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
coming in and making a
little proton in the middle.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So imagine all the information
that's spinning together

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:90%
that makes up a proton.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I calculated that.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I calculated how
many Plancks are

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of the
radius of a proton.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed when I
finished the calculation

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
because the mass of
all the little Plancks

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
inside the proton
added up to the mass

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:90%
of the universe precisely.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So right away, it
seemed holographic,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
which in principle
means that all

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the information of the whole
is present in each point.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was finding that.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
All the information,
all the energy

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be present in
the Planck information

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
inside the proton.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of the
universe being in there.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Just think of the information
of the universe being

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in there, just like when you
play a CD of a music orchestra,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:90%
the violin is not on the CD.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
The piano is not on the CD.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The orchestra director or
conductor is not on the CD.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But all of these things and the
information are there, right?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So think of the information
being present holographically

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:90%
in the Planck field.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine how small the
Planck granular structure must

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
be to contain all the
information of all

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:84%
of the other protons in
the universe in one proton.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
equation was giving.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
But then I thought,
wait a minute.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
That information is inside
the mini black hole, right?

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not able to come out.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It's restricted
by the information

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that's on the surface, the
entropy of the black hole.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So then I looked
at the relationship

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
between the surface
and the inside.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
How much of the
information inside could

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:90%
go through the surface?

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I got a number which is
the ratio between the two.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I multiplied that
number by the mass

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of 1 bit of
information, 1 Plank,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:90%
to get the mass of the ratio.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I got the exact
mass of the proton.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I manipulated
the equation,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I got a radius for the
proton, and that radius

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
was 4% smaller than
what is predicted

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:90%
by the standard model.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I published
this, then I predicted--

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and this was in
December of 2012--

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I predicted that when we
would measure the proton

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
more precisely, we might
find that smaller radius.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a result of
these experiments that

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
showed that the radius of the
proton from muonic scattering

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
was smaller than predicted
by the standard model.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
And my prediction was
precisely that new radius

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:90%
that was measured.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So that radius was
confirmed, and my prediction

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
was inside one standard
deviation of the experiment.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was inside the margin
of error of experiment.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So my radius may have
been even much more

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:90%
precise than the experiment.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> This means fundamentally
that the information network

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the spinning of this
Plank field into existence

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:90%
in the universe--

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
connects everything together
since all the information

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is present in one point
in the center of an atom.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So if that was true, then
I should be able to take that

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
equation and extrapolate it
to the rest of the universe.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
That took me a while, of course.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not simple.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm describing this
in simple terms.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:90%
It gets complicated.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you can
take this equation

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to the electron.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
That I have published.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And it does the right
radius and the right mass

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:90%
for the electron, and so on.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It can be applied to
the whole universe,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and it gives the right
mass for the universe

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
without the need of dark
matter and dark energy.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It gives the right
acceleration for the universe.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And as we discovered
just recently,

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
it gives the right
temperature, and so on.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we write the equation
in a more classical way using

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
thermodynamics, you actually
can get from this equation

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the scales
in our universe,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
including superclusters,
clusters, galaxies, stars,

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So we get everything
in the universe

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
emerging from this
holographic view of creation.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make sure I
make this distinction again.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not a holographic plate
somewhere in the universe

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:84%
projecting a
holographic creation.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It is all of the interference
pattern of spacetime

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Planck field creating
the interference weaving

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of the information
in the universe

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
producing this
holographic effect.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Pushing the holographic
analogy to a 2D surface

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
projecting our
universe is wrong.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done by
physicists and scientists

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
out there misleading and
overreaching the analogy.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:90%
That is not the case.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the
universe is holographic

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
natural behavior

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of the oscillation
structure of the field that

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
makes up our universe.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Every scale has the development
of a little black hole

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
or a large black hole,
like the center of a galaxy

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:90%
or the center of an atom.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically black
holes all the way up and all

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:90%
the way down.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the evidence
for this is that when

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
we solve these equations
for our universe,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:84%
it clearly demonstrated
that the universe is

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
a membrane that obeys the exact
condition to be a black hole.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:90%
So it really is not debatable.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It gives the correct mass.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
But not only that.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It gives the correct
temperature for the black hole.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
That is, the equation gives
us the correct radiation

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
for that black hole, which
would give the temperature.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature it
gives is the temperature

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:84%
we measure in the background
temperature of our universe.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it definitely
demonstrates

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that we live inside a black
hole and that everything

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
inside that black hole are
smaller black holes that

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
organize in certain ways to
make clusters, superclusters,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, eventually
stars and planets

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and biology and all this stuff.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And the dynamics of this black
hole structure across scale

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
divides in very specific
harmonic relationship.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of the universe
being one wavelength,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
very long wavelength, and
then shorter wavelengths

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and shorter wavelengths
and shorter wavelengths

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
the Planck, and then

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
eventually, as we discovered
with this equation, sub-Planck.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And the sub-Planck
wavelength that we discovered

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is the same distance
from the Planck

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
as the Planck is from the
wavelength of the universe.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So the Planck radius, to Planck
size, the Planck little ball,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is in between the size of the
universe and the sub-Planck.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%
So these are huge scales.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:90%
They're immense.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, if we
take a little Planck,

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
one bit of information
at the Planck scale,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and we grow it in scale to
the size of a grain of sand,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
then the nucleus of
an atom, the proton,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
which is extremely
small already,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
would have a diameter the
approximate equivalent between

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:90%
the sun and Alpha Centauri.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
That diameter is about
40 trillion kilometers

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
or 4.2 light years
from Earth, a distance

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that would take about
6,300 years to travel

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:90%
using current technology.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the change in
scale between the Planck field

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:90%
and the atom.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that it
was easy for standard physics,

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
for the physics community
to have missed it, right?

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's so teeny.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It's so far removed from the
scale at which we experience

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
reality that it's
nothing that we

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:90%
knew was there until recently.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Now we're starting
to discover, oh, wow,

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
these little Planck
oscillators really

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:84%
have an impact on
black hole physics.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering, yes, the
temperature and the entropy

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of a black hole
is related to what

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
these little Plancks are doing.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
In my equation,
we're discovering

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that actually, all of the
mass, the forces, everything

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
we see in the universe is
actually the result of what

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:90%
these little Planck are doing.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But then you can ask, well, what
are these little Planck made

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:90%
of?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're probably
made of smaller Plancks.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
calculated with the equation

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
because the equation
gives us the scales.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So we could calculate
down as well.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And we found that the next
scale of the sub-Planck

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:84%
would be the same distance from
the sub-Planck to the Planck

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
as of from the Planck to the
size of the universe, which

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
would lead you to
say, well, maybe

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
our universe is like a
Planck for a larger universe,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and that universe is like a
Planck for an even larger one.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And now you're starting to get
the sense that the equation is

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:84%
telling us about things that are
much further, much outside what

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:90%
we can directly observe.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But since it is accurate
for everything we observe,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
we know that it's most likely
accurate for these things that

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:90%
we cannot observe as well.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And that would mean that we
live in a larger universe,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and that universe is
in a larger universe.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And thus, we should be
talking about multiverse.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And the multiverses are
not parallel to each other,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:84%
but they're embedded within
each other like Russian dolls.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, at any scale
that you look at,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a
parallel relationship.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:90%
You look at galaxies.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a galaxy
here and a galaxy there

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're approximately
all the same scales, right?

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But then you see nothing,
and then eventually, you

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
see stars, right?

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And then stars are approximately
all the same scales.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
They're all in a band of scales.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that scale, I could
say things are parallel.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So it would be the
same as I would say,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:90%
well, here's our universe.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that scale of
universes, there's

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.650 align:middle line:84%
other universes
that are parallel.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Think of bubbles of
universes that are parallel.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But that scale would
be embedded in a larger

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
scale that's a larger universe,
like Russian doll universe.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So this gives us a
much different view

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of our world,
the structure of our universe,

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and the holographic and as well
fractal nature of creation.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
What's important
to remember here

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
is that creation
appears to be the result

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of a flow of information in
which each point contains

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:90%
the whole.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
As the Planck fields
spiral into creation,

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
the information,
because there is

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
smaller and smaller and
smaller bits of information

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:90%
in each point, is conserved.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And all of knowledge
about the whole

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
can be extrapolated
from the part.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
these equations,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
we discover we literally
were studying the proton.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We were studying the
proton using this equation,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up
extrapolating the mass

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, its
temperature, its acceleration,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So from the point
of a proton, we

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
learned about the
whole universe.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine what
that means to you.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:36.230 align:middle line:84%
That means that from
any proton in your body,

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:84%
if you were able to
connect and have access,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:84%
you could know about everything
else in the universe.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
You can know about the
place you've never been,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:90%
remote view that place.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:84%
You could influence something
that is far away from you.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
implication to these equations

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that actually meet some of the
most esoteric concept and some

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of the esoteric
experience people

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
have been having in the world
where they think of somebody,

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and they call, or they go to
a place, and then they say,

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
oh, I dreamed about that place.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I know that place.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Although they've never
been there physically.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:10%
If all the information is
present in every point,

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:10%
that means that you can
have access to information

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:10%
that's non-local to you.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And that means as well that
you can learn from within you.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:10%
That is, not all knowledge comes
from outside of you into you,

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:10%
but that actually, you have
knowledge within you that

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:10%
can emerge from you.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
creative process.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And that leads as well to
understanding the source

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:90%
of awareness or consciousness.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:90%
