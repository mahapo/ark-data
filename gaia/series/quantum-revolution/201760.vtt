00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Is the universe random?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
discuss how the rise

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of complexity in our universe
supports a completely different

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.476 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:24.925 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Standard science and physics
specifically has been very

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:10%
strong in believing that we
live in a random universe,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:10%
that everything happens just
because things are bumping

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:10%
into each other by chance.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Somehow by this
incredible fluke,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:84%
our world came about with
all the biology on it,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
we see, including us.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it even feasible
that the universe

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
would be the result of
some random structure

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden
made up biology?

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Our calculation
shows absolutely not.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
The rise of complexity, that is
the rise of the organized bio

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
structure that we see on
our planet, for instance,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
cannot occur out of
just random function.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact that everything in the
universe has to be tuned just

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
right for this to happen, cannot
be the result of just random

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:90%
fluctuations.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be order.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that when you start

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
to talk about there's
got to be order,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
it scares the scientific
community terribly.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:90%
The reason is historic.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Science was developed
as a way to get away

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:84%
from religion, a way to
get away from the concept

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that there's some creator
sitting in a big throne that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:90%
organizing creation.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Science needed to
depart from that view.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And one way to do it was to
assume that actually there

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing, that
everything is just random,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
everything happens by
chance, and we got here

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
just because the
chances were good,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and we ended up showing up.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
This is contrary to simple
statistical analysis

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the
calculations one can do

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is the probability
of the nucleotides.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:10%
There is about 100 natural
occurring nucleotides

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:10%
that make up the RNA molecules.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:10%
And those are required
for life to emerge.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Nucleotides form the
basic structural components

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:10%
or building blocks
of DNA and RNA.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:10%
They are the repository
of the genetic information

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:10%
responsible for the transmission
of inherited characteristics

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:10%
from parents to children,
and from one cell to another.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the morphological
and functional uniqueness

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
of each living being are
determined by the information

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%
contained in them.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So even for a mono-cellular
life, like one cell,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
there's that need that molecule
has to assemble in such a way

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that about a hundred-trillion
atoms would make a cell.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, when you calculate the
probability of that happening

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:10%
just by random
chance, the nucleotide

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:10%
trying to fit together, and
just bumping into each other,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:10%
and getting the
right configuration,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden making
a cellular structure;

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:10%
the probability are 1
multiplied by 10 to the 8,896.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:84%
That number is so huge that the
probabilities can pretty well

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:90%
be thought to be zero.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's use another example the
universe is really, really big.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You could measure the radius
of the universe in centimeters.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
A centimeter is very, very
small compared to the universe.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Think of the solar system
is already big, right?

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
There's billions and billions
of stars to almost 200

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:90%
billion stars in our galaxy.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Galaxies are big.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Galaxies are very, very teeny
compared to our universe.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the galaxy
from our universal size,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:90%
it looks like a star.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't even see that
it's composed of stars.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So you'd say, if
I'm going to measure

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
the radius of the
universe in centimeters,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need a
lot of centimeters.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, the radius of the
universe in centimeters

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.815 align:middle line:84%
is approximately 10
to the 28 centimeters.

00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 28 is a very,
very large number then.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the probability
that nucleotides

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
would just all of a sudden
bump into each other

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
just right, to
come out with life

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
are in the probabilities
of 10 to the 8,896.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you could say
those probabilities are zero.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just not going
to happen that way.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
One approach has been to
invoke infinite universes.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And say, well, in an
infinite amount of universes,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
there would be
more probabilities

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden
one of those universes

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
would get the nucleotides right,
and would get all the pieces

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:90%
right, and life would emerge.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:90%
This is really a cop-out.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It scares the
scientists to say, oh,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
there might be an
organizing mechanism.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they start thinking, oh,
that's sounding like religion.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a whole lot
more simpler explanation

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
than some god
organizing creation,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
or the universe is
completely random,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and somehow in an infinite
amount of universes,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
we just happen to luck out
and be in the universe that

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
has exactly the right
configuration for everything

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to just come right,
and end up with us.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
The alternative is that there
is feedback in the information

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you have feedback,
you have organization.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we see
in the natural world.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
We see species that modifies
their structure, that modifies

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
their behavior, based
on the feedback they

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:90%
get from the environment.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
You change the environment,
the species change.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:90%
They start adapting.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
The self-organizing
structure and the rise

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of complexity in our world may
be the result of the feedback

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
structure, of the
information network that's

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
occurring at all
the scales, which

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:90%
is what our equations describe.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember from what we learned so
far throughout these episodes,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
there is a field of information,
the Planck fluctuation

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
at the basis of everything.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The way the
information organizes

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:84%
produces little scales
and bigger scales

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:90%
across all of the universe.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
And the information in
each one of those scales

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
can be radiated from the center
out, and absorb in again,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
one being the
electromagnetic field

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and one being the
gravitational field.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The information feedback would
produce higher and higher level

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of organization,
very, very rapidly.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
A good example is
a Rubik's cube.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Think of a blind person trying
to order a Rubik's cube.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:84%
While if you calculate
the probabilities

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
of that blind person ordering
the Rubik's cube by chance,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know
if they're getting closer

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
or further from the
solution, and let's

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
assume that they're making
a move every second.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So every second
they make a move.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You can calculate
the probability

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of them ordering it by chance
about 158 or 160 billion years.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Our universe we know is
approximately 13.7-13.8 billion

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So it exceeds the time of
the universe by a long shot.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you give feedback
to that person, that

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is every time they move the
Rubik's cube, every time they

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
make a move, you say yes or
no; yes, you're getting closer;

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
no, you're getting further.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Then about 2 to 2 and 1/2
minutes, the Rubik's cube

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
will be ordered, just with a
simple binary feedback, yes,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
feedback that's going

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
on in all of the
structures of the universe,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
with the Planck field being
each bit of information

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:84%
feeding back into this loop,
into these toroidal dynamics

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The system is
learning about itself.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The system is
absorbing information,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
injecting information,
and exchanging information

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
through this incredible
structure network of spacetime.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The network is
learning about itself.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We see this in biology.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Think of microbes learning
about the environment

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and modifying
themselves so that they

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
can be more and more
efficient in the environment.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Think of viruses
modifying themselves,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
like the cold virus every
year is a little different,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because it adapts itself to
learn about the environment

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and be more efficient.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So this alternative
to understanding the rise

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
of the complex nature of
biology in the universe

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and the organization
of the universe,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
tells us something very
profound about ourselves,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
but as well something very
profound about consciousness,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and awareness in our universe.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
That is that awareness
and consciousness is not

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
something that's only localized
to the brain of a human being.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But that the brain
of a human being

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
may be actually part of
a feedback of information

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
at the Planck scale,
at the quantum scale.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's feeding information
into the quantum scale.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The quantum scale is
feeding back experiences,

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in a continuous feedback
feed-forward loop.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself
throughout the day.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
You emanate thermodynamically.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:10%
As you radiate information, as
you radiate thermodynamically,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:10%
you're making very
coordinated actions.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:90%
You're doing things.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You're absorbing information
from the stuff around you,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
through your eyes, through
your nose, through your senses.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:90%
You're getting information.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:10%
You're feeding that back
through the Planck field

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:10%
that makes you into all
of the Planck memory

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:10%
network of spacetime.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I call it space memory network,
because without memory, there

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:90%
is no time.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can't remember
anything before this moment,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you don't know that there's
a linear movement of time,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that there's a linear
function of time.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:90%
No memory, no time.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's more accurate to
describe space memory then

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:90%
space time.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is that when you're

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
flowing through space, when you
are interacting with the Planck

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
field, when you're interacting
with the information

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
of the field, you are
leaving an imprint,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:90%
frame dragging across space.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the planet is
going at very high velocity

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
through space, as it's
going around the sun,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and the sun's going in
this galaxy, and so on.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You're leaving information
on the structure of space

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in coordinates in space and
time is just information

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:90%
on the coordinates of space.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:10%
So your memory and
the memory that

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:10%
makes it so that biology
or atomic structure

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:10%
can organize eventually into
biology, the memory of space

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:10%
and time is what you're actually
thinking of as your memory.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
When you remember
something, you're

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
accessing information in the
coordinates of space time

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:90%
where that action took place.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You are entangled with
this information set.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That is a completely
different view of who you are.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
your brain is not

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
manufacturing consciousness
or an epi-phenomena

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But your brain is
more like an antenna,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
connecting to information
sets, and these information

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
set producing reactions in
your body that you act upon.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the feedback structure
of the space memory network,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
as we describe it.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And we wrote papers on this.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It changes completely our
understanding of ourself

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and our interaction
with the universe.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So you might ask then,
is everything conscious?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if the information
flow is across all the scales,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine a star
that's spinning through space

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is affecting the memory network
in its region, the Planck

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
field, and making
smaller vortices which

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:90%
spins out that we call stars.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And then these stars can
make smaller vortices

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
at the event horizon
that spins out

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
into particles we call protons.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And electrons, and table
of elements, and all this

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:90%
stuff coming out of stars.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And then these organize
into smaller vortices

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
created by the star
in the Planck field

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:90%
that we call planets.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And then on the surface of those
planets, these atoms that were

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:90%
made by the stars organize.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
feeding information

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
into the feedback
loop of spacetime,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and start organizing
into systems that are

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:90%
getting more and more complex.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the whole
universe is conspiring.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can't say
consciousness starts here,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and anything before that
is not consciousness.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
of the information

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
flow throughout that
whole chain of events

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that eventually gets to
the complexity large enough

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that the system
becomes self-aware.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean when you
say we're conscious,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
we're a bag of fluids, mostly
water with minerals in it,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that have organized
themselves in a certain way.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this bag of
water and minerals

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
is an antenna for information,
then this information

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:84%
flow or what we call
consciousness is everywhere.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything is conscious.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness is the
mechanics of the information

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
through the whole thing.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:10%
So that the rock
over there is really

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:10%
just part of this mechanics
that eventually produced

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:10%
the complexity necessary for
a system to become self-aware

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:10%
which is a remarkable thing.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a universe
learning about itself

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to the point that it
becomes aware of itself.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And it grows into a more
and more complex system.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully our civilization will
learn about itself fast enough,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
so that it will survive
some of the larger challenge

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that it has created for
itself by a misunderstanding

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
of its relationship
with the universe.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like spacetime is
the hard drive that's

00:18:54.910 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
getting imprinted all of the
information of the structure

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
as it moves through it,
and all of the complexity.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So a planet moving
through the Planck field

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
is leaving a very specific
trail that's more simple,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that's less complex.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
As the planet spiraled
through space,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is important
as well, the mechanics

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
are not where systems
come back on themself.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But they actually evolve
as they move through space.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So our Sun is moving
through the galaxy.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Our planets are
spiraling around it.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're leaving a
trail of information.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we imprint
the structure of spacetime

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
with the information that
we think of as our memory.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You could even think of it
as the gene set that makes

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:90%
who you are who you are.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the information
of all the ancestry

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
of your mother, and your
father, and their grandmother,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
genetic information

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that eventually makes
you, how can that

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
be contained in the simple
molecules of biology?

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
These molecules are imprinted
with the information which

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:90%
is in the structure of space.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
These molecules are
accessing the information

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of almost an infinite
amount of genealogy

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of all of your ancestors
throughout the structure

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of space, which makes
so that your nose is

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.020 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like
this, and your eyes

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit like
that, and your ears.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's still not
your grandfather

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
or your grandmother,
it's something different.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It's something that has evolved.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Because you're spiraling.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is learning.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Each generation is learning
at a different rate,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
at a different level, at a
different level of complexity.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Think of the complexity of
the life of our generation.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:90%
And then I have children.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at
my children, they

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:84%
learn so much faster than I
learned when I was younger,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
because their
environment is different

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:90%
as well, because we've evolved.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So now they have a smartphone
in their hands at the age of 9,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
where we were still bicycling
around, throwing balls

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in the backyard at that age.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
They are getting information
from the internet

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
about anything
they want to know.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing is
learning about itself.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're leaving
the information

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of spacetime
as we move through space

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
for the generation to come.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But as well, we're projecting
information in our future.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
That is we have the
capacity to take

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:84%
the information of the past,
arrange it in certain ways,

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to intend certain
things in the future.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, since the whole memory
network structure of spacetime

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is wormhole connected, think
of the Plancks behind me

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
are influencing the
Plancks in front of me.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain path that
is being laid in front of me.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:10%
This is what we
think of as destiny.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
The natural flow of
creation, the natural flow

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, we
think we have free will.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we may have
free will locally.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But we're part of a larger
flow, all the other human beings

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, all
of the animals,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the planet
through space, the sun,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:90%
the galaxy, all this.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:90%
We can all overcome this.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
We can start to
influence the flow more.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
The way we interpret the
information of the past

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to influence the
way the information organize

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
in our future.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So with our intent, we can
interpret the past in a way

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that we get more of the future
we want, and less of the future

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:90%
we don't want.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
When we change as well our
interaction with the past,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
we're not just
changing it for us.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
This is how we change
in the present.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We think of the past
in a different way.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the concept of,
for instance, psychology.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
You think about past
events that influenced you,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the psychiatrist
or the psychologist

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
can give you a new
perspective on it.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd think
about it differently.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And it changes you
in the present.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I believe
the phenomenon of epigenetics

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
is starting to be discovered.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Epigenetics involve genetic
control by factors other than

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:90%
an individual's DNA sequence.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It works through
chemical tags added

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to chromosomes that in effect
switch genes on or off.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
This affects how
cells read the genes.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetic change is a regular
and natural occurrence,

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
but can also be influenced
by several factors,

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
including age, the
environment, lifestyle,

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and plays a critical
role in disease.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The genes that you have at
birth are not stuck in cement.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:90%
They evolve.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
They change.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
They change, because you change.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And you're changing the past.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's field
equation predicts

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can modify the past,
and that you can time travel.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:10%
This new view of
spacetime starts

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.030 align:middle line:10%
to give you a little bit
more of the mechanics

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:10%
and the understanding of not
just how that's possible,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:10%
but how the existence
of the human beings

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:10%
is actually doing
that all the time.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:10%
Time is information
in coordinates

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:10%
in space, in which each
coordinate is a Planck time.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very short time.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's like frames.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And the frames are rolling,
just like a movie frame,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:90%
rolling at the speed of light.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:90%
So it appears smooth.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But even the movement
of your hand in space

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
is not smooth, meaning
that it's not clear

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
how to measure the
movement of your hand

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.450 align:middle line:84%
in space, because you can
measure it in standard physics.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
You would say, OK, it
left point A at this time.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It arrived at point
B at this time.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%
It traveled this distance.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I can calculate the velocity
of the hand through space.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%
It was going at 3 miles an hour.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
What is forgotten when you do
this measurement is that you've

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
isolated the system.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
You've made it an
isolated system.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
You've isolated your hand
from all the other movements

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're honest about what's
going on with your hand,

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
while you're moving
from point A to point B,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you have to add the speed of
the Earth, because as you move,

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:90%
the Earth was spinning.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to add
the rotation of the Earth

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
around the Sun, as you
move your hand, and the Sun

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy, and so on.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And so now your hand
is going at very, very

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
close to the speed of
light very quickly.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So what is movement
becomes complex, right?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Well you could think of movement
in a completely different way.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You could think of movement
as you recorded your hand

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Planck field at
this coordinates in space,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and then the next Planck
second, so your hand

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:90%
became the whole Planck field.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
your hand again

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:84%
at the next Planck second,
but in a coordinate

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:90%
that's a little bit beside it.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And so your hand then
is undoing and redoing,

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and undoing and
redoing, and undoing.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And everything in the universe
is fluctuating like that

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:84%
as it's creating and as
it's moving to space.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
The thing to
remember from this is

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that you are not separate
from the dynamics that

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
produces supernovas, and stars,
and galaxies, and universes,

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and the structure of
spacetime at the Planck scale.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You're part of this
flow of information.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:10%
And what you call your
body and the complexity

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:10%
of the biology all around
you, the fractal nature

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:10%
of the trees, and the
plants, and everything;

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:10%
is all an emergence of
this information flow,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:10%
including what you think
of as your consciousness.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]
