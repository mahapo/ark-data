Do they exist?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that a system
can produce more energy

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:10%
than it takes to run it?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
In physics, certainly
in standard physics,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a system
being perpetual

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:90%
is thought to be impossible.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Systems always lose energy,
entropy takes hold of them,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and eventually, they stop.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:10%
In fact, most physicists
and scientists,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:10%
if you tell them that
there is possibility

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:10%
of infinite amount of
energy or overunity

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:10%
devices or perpetual
motion, they

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:10%
will tell you that
you're a kook,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:10%
and they will stop listening.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
However, if you're an
engineer out there,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:10%
if you're a physicist,
if you're a scientist,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:10%
I will challenge you to find me
something in the universe, one

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:10%
thing, that is not perpetual.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Stars, planets,
galaxies, atoms, protons,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
which makes up everything,
have never been seen to decay.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Not one proton since the
beginning of the universe

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
has been observed to decay.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we are living
in a perpetual motion

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:90%
mechanism of creation.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
As we've seen from
the earlier episode,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:90%
spacetime is not empty.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's full of energy.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
fractalize to infinity.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
There is deeper and deeper,
smaller and smaller,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
finer and finer
frequency of energy

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that leads to larger
and larger energy events

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
as stars, galaxy

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
clusters, super clusters,
universes, multiverses.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
All of this has been
in continuous motion

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
as far back as we can see.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So maybe perpetual motion
and unity or overunity

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is a natural state of our
universe and the multiverse.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just that humans have
not been able to achieve this.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's because humans
haven't understood clearly

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
how energy in the
universe works and is

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:90%
transferred across scales.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in physics, the
concept of energy is unclear.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We all know that E
equals MC square.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
E is energy, so this should
tell you what energy is.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:10%
Energy equals the mass
of the system multiplied

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:10%
by the speed of light square.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:10%
We know what the
speed of light is,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know why it's
going at the speed of light.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:10%
In the case of M,
in the case of Mass,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:10%
without the findings
of my equations,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:10%
the standard model
does not know what

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:10%
mass is, where it comes from.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
unknowns on one side

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
of the equation, which makes the
other side an unknown as well.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
what exactly is energy.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
However, when we introduce
this holographic mass solution

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:10%
of our equation, now
we realize that mass

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:10%
is the result of fluctuation at
the quantum scale of the Planck

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:10%
And that when these vacuum
fluctuations organize

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:10%
in spinning oscillation
of vortices,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:10%
they emit a certain amount
of energy that we call mass.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Those equations are clearly
defined in their geometry,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
in what is calls
statistical entropy,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and even now, in
Brownian motion,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
which we've been able to apply
to the motion of the Planck

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
oscillators to describe
the interaction that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
produces what we see as mass.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So we know the vacuum
fluctuation at the quantum

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:90%
level is what's producing mass.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
We can insert that
in this equation

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
so that all of a
sudden, M is actually

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
vacuum oscillations
that are moving

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
at the square of
the speed of light,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
producing the energy
of the system.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
This gives us a straight
path to engineering.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
standard model would

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
think that a system can never
be overunity or at least

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
at unity, that is, consuming
as much as it's producing?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when we do the
analysis of a system

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
in standard physics, we
assume that the system

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:90%
is a closed system.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, we've placed the
device or the system

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
we're analyzing
in a box, assuming

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
it's not interacting with any
other field in the universe.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, from the
equations we've written,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
everything is interacting
with everything

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
through this vacuum fluctuation
structure of spacetime that

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:90%
produces wormholes everywhere.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
In that case, the electron, the
proton, the atom, the planets,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the stars, the galaxies, the
clusters, the super clusters,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
the universes, are all being
fed by a source of energy

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that is circulating
across all the scales.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And that source is this quantum
field, the vacuum fluctuation.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Thus, by understanding this
and the source of mass,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the source of gravity, the
source of the energy that

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
runs everything, we can learn
to engineer the vacuum, vacuum

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:90%
engineering.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
pulling atoms from a vacuum

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
chamber, but a new kind
of vacuum engineering

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that actually teach us
or learn to manipulate

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the structure of
the quantum vacuum

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get
energetic effects out of it.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms, where the
natural universe makes vortices

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
that we see a different scale
as a protons, as an atom,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
as a galaxy or at
super cluster scale,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
we could, in the
laboratory, couple

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to the vacuum with
electromagnetic fields

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and rotate the vacuum to produce
our own vortex, our own energy

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
event, and extract
massive amount of energy

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
from the structure
of the vacuum.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:10%
And as we utilize this
energy in our world,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:10%
it would eventually go
back into the vacuum,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:10%
so we're not depleting anything
or anywhere in the multiverse,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:10%
but we're actually just
putting our devices

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:10%
in the natural wheel work or the
natural flow of the structure

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:10%
of space, just like we put a
turbine in the natural flow

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:10%
of water going down the hill,
and we extract energy from it.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely different
view of energy, mass,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and our understanding that
no system is a closed system.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
All systems are open
systems, and they are all

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the
structure of the vacuum.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Vacuum engineering
thus is rapidly

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:84%
becoming one of the
most important endeavors

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It is critical that
it is supported.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the opportunity
for humanity

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to overcome some of the largest
difficulties in our society

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with the
production of energy,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the influence of our technology
on our environment as a result

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
of the way we produce
energy and the destruction

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
of the biosphere
on which we live.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
This new understanding has
a clear path to technology

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that will completely
transform our world.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
A certain amount of
coupling to the vacuum

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to
overcome the viscosity

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
field that we call back

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
EMF, in a magnetic
motor, for instance, so

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that the magnetic motor produces
at least the same amount

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of energy that it
consumes or more.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it could, if
we do this correctly,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
produce vastly more
energy than it consumes,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the
rotational shaft power

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to run your car or
energy fluctuation

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
emanating from a coil, overunity
devices are well on their way.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Many have worked on them
throughout the ages,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and some reported success.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:84%
However, in the context of
the current standard model

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of physics, since these device
are thought to be impossible,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
not much attention was
brought to these devices.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:10%
And in many cases, the
inventors were labeled as kooks

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:10%
and were censored in
many different ways.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
This must change in
our society today.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, from this equation,
we have a basis

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to understand why these
devices are possible.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
They have critical
impact to play

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in the development
of our society,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and they are the possibility and
the salvation of our society,

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
transforming the way we
do things on our planet

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
makes it sustainable.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the only path
to sustainability.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We must learn to extract energy
from the source of energy that

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is at the foundation of creation
that we call quantum vacuum

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:90%
fluctuations.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Coupling to the vacuum
structure with a magnetic motor

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
or even with a static device
that is extracting energy

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
from the vacuum is
really one small step

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
towards a whole new battery
of equipment and technology

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that will be developed
from this new understanding

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum
vacuum fluctuation

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and how to cohere it in ways
that gives us energy, but as

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:90%
well many other applications.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
For instance, as we saw
throughout this episode, when

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
we look at the way
mass is generated

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
as a result of vorticity in the
structure of the Planck field,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:84%
we see that this vorticity
is curving spacetime,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
or that spacetime curvature is
the result of this vorticity,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:90%
to be more precise.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the curvature of
spacetime or the curvature

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Planck field,
or if you'd like,

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
the vorticity of
the ether, is how

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:90%
gravity is produced naturally.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a secondary effect
of the spin of spacetime,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
the spin of the quantum vacuum.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, if we learn to
couple to the quantum vacuum,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and we produce vorticity in it
artificially in a laboratory,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
then we can produce our
own gravitational field.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
We can generate our own mass.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
By doing so, we can control
gravitational field,

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
just like we've built
all of our society

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
today, because we've learned
to control magnetic fields

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic
fields and electricity.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The control of gravity is
essential for any society

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that
eventually needs

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to birth their society into
a space colony society that

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is able to go around
their solar system, that's

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
able to go around its galaxy,
that's able to go around

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
even the universe.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
This will not happen by burning
fossil fuel in rocketry.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It will not.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the incredible
investment that

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
is going on in
private industry today

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.985 align:middle line:84%
to continue to explore the
universe using rocketry

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:39.785 align:middle line:90%
should seize.

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The attention should be
placed on gravity control,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
understanding gravity
and controlling

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the vacuum
to produce acceleration

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in a very controlled
way, in a way

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
in which the energy, necessarily
for the acceleration,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is actually provided by the
natural energy of the vacuum

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people have been
working on this, including

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Sonny White at NASA, that
has done great work in moving

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
forward in producing a warp
drive for the NASA experiments

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
by tapping in the structure
of the vacuum, what they think

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of as an exotic energy.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
However, that energy
is not exotic.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
That energy is the foundation
of all of creation.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing exotic about it.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere, and it's
producing everything we see.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
This investigation is
one of the most important

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
scientific investigations
on the planet,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and currently, it
is very ill-funded.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not well understood.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And very few people
know about the need

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to make this a
priority in our world.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
In order for this to happen,
this type of investigation

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and this type of
engineering has to come out

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
from the underground dark
alleys of our physics community

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and of our scientific
community and into the light

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and be completely
supported, funded,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and should be one of the
strongest, most powerful

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:90%
efforts of humanity in history.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
This opportunity
is extraordinary.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The quantum vacuum fluctuations
at the quantum scale

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:84%
have an energy density
larger than the mass

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of the universe in a
centimeter cube of space

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
by 39 orders of magnitude.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
If we extract one
billionth of a billionth

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
of a billionth of a
percent of the energy

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:84%
that's in a centimeter cube
of space in terms of quantum

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
vacuum fluctuation, we
would have enough energy

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to run our planet for
thousands of years.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
In week coupling to the
vacuum, we could as well

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
have devices that
influence biology,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
so that biology stays coherent.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
That the communication link
between cells and the structure

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of the geometry of the
cells and the cells'

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
arrangement in the biological
structure stay highly coherent

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:90%
and minimize the entropy.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
That means that we
should be able to make

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
medical devices, which we have
started in my laboratory, that

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
oscillate with the
vacuum a little bit,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that couples to the
vacuum a little bit

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to produce a field
of interaction

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
with biology that makes
biology higher in energy,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
more coherent, and the water
structure that interacts

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
with all of the
cells, for instance,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
in your body, the interstitial
fluids in your body,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the blood in your
body, the spinal fluids

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and so on, to stay in a
high level of coherency,

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
so that cells can
live much longer.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They can have a much
higher level of energy.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And that would change as
well our life expectancy.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So many, many
different applications

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
are possible with
this new understanding

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that we can become
vacuum engineers,

00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
quantum vacuum engineers, and
build technology that will

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
completely transform our world.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Overunity devices will
change everyday life.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:10%
Of course they will put
an end to fossil fuel,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:10%
drilling holes
everywhere in the Earth.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It will change the
way we do business.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, energy is the
source of our society,

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and the financial
structure of our society

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is very much based on the
exchange of goods for energy.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:90%
So this will change as well.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Our society will change
from a society that

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is based on scarcity
into a society that

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
is based on abundance, an
abundance amount of energy

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and an abundance amount of
resources, especially coupled

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.465 align:middle line:90%
with gravity control.

00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
These devices may be
built at different scales.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And although the electrical
network grid that we use today

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
might remain initially,
eventually, it

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
is very much possible
that every device

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
will get its own little power
source that's extracting energy

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
from the vacuum so that the
grid is no longer necessary,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
which is actually a very
large liability for humanity.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very sensitive to
any electromagnetic pulses

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a sun
flare could easily

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
wipe out the energy
grid of a whole country,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and it has happened in
the past, and this us

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:90%
makes us very vulnerable.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So this type of
technology will as well

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
help humanity become more robust
and have a much higher success

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%
rate in its survival.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, for instance,
that your computer will

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:90%
have a little device in there.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It might be a little
crystalline battery,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
that instead of having to
be recharged all the time,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is just extracting
energy from the structure

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:90%
of the vacuum wherever it is.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So your computer
constantly has power,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and your cell phone
constantly has power.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Your electric car doesn't need
to be plugged in at night.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
You can drive your electric
car across the continent

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:90%
if you want.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
recharge, because you're

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.861 align:middle line:84%
extracting energy from the
structure of the vacuum.

00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
All these things become
possible and will be our future

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
if the proper effort is made
in developing quantum vacuum

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
engineering in the
next few years.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to say as
well that this is not

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in 10
generations from now.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:90%
This is in our generation.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
This must happen
in our generation.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
In the next two decades,
we must achieve this level

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of vacuum engineering if we
want the world to have a chance

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to overcome some of our largest
environmental challenges.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Gravity control devices--
and some people call them

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:90%
anti-gravity devices--

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that
terminology, because it's not

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:90%
counter to gravity.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not anti-gravity.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way
to control gravity

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
so that instead
of being attracted

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of
an object, we're

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
being attracted to
a point in space

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:90%
towards where we're moving.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:10%
Gravitational devices
are the natural result

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:10%
of understanding gravity
at a deeper level.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Just like in the
early 1900s, when

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:10%
we started to understand
magnetism and electric field

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:10%
a little better, we
started to engineer devices

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:10%
that could control the
electromagnetic fields

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:10%
and produce electricity,
produce communication.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
devices we have today

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
is the result of this
discovery of how to control

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic fields.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The same can occur with
our deeper understanding

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
of what is gravity
and how to control it.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
We can make devices
that controls

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
the gravitational field
in a region of space,

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
so that instead
of being attracted

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of the
planet, we are actually

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
lifting up or being attracted
away from the planet.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a device that makes
a vorticular structure

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of
the quantum vacuum,

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that this place, the gradient of
that vortex ahead of the ship.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The ship would fall into
that vortex ahead of itself

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and move away from the
surface of the planet

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
or away from any direction,
in any direction we want.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Gravity control is the result
of a very clear path that

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
has been defined now as
we understand the vacuum

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
fluctuation at the deeper
level and understand

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:90%
how mass is produced.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We think of gravity
as the result

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of mass curving spacetime.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
If we realize that mass is the
result of spacetime spinning,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
we can couple to
spacetime and spin it.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's think of it maybe with
a plasma, high energy plasma,

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
spinning at velocities that are
a high percentage of the speed

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
of light and actually
curve spacetime and control

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.190 align:middle line:84%
its curvature to accelerate the
ship in any direction we want.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden, we are
using the energy of spacetime

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to curve itself in the direction
we want, so the energy required

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to do the job is
actually contained

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in the dynamics
of the technology

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that you are building, so it
becomes very plausible that we

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
could achieve this
in the next decade.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The structure of
the quantum vacuum

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is not only the source of
mass and energy and gravity,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:10.960 align:middle line:84%
but as well is the source of
the coherent dynamic structure,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
the complexity that
emerged from the field

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
eventually to produce biology.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, as we learn
to engineer the vacuum,

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
we can build technology
that couples with the vacuum

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to produce energy events that
would feed or energize biology.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I have done multiple
experiments in our laboratory.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I have got some results on
that field of investigation.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And thus we should be able to
produce medical devices that

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
actually re-establish
proper coherency

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
in cell-to-cell interaction
during illness, in a being,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
in a biological structure,
even maybe grow plants

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:84%
much faster, which we
have been able to verify

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:90%
in our laboratories.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Change, you know,
alimentation so that it's

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:90%
much higher in energy.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Increase the energy of
water and the coherency

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of water, the
structure of water,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
so it becomes more bioavailable.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that biology
and health and life

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:84%
becomes much more coherent, much
higher in energy, and so that

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
eventually, life extension
could be brought forward,

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:84%
where we have seen in
laboratory that cells

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that are in the proper
environment will not die.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
We've had laboratory
tests where cells

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
were placed in a Petri dish in
which the water is continuously

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
renewed, so that the cell
can eliminate properly

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and is fed properly.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:90%
The cells then do not die.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:10%
So if we are able to bring
a high level of coherency

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:10%
in the structure of water,
which is the source of life,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:10%
it's the conduit from which the
vacuum fluctuation interacts

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:10%
to produce the complexity in
the amino acid and the minerals

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:10%
and assemble the minerals
and the amino acid

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:33.340 align:middle line:10%
into what we call life, then we
have a very clear and straight

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:10%
path to eventually producing
a health device that

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:10%
can have a significant impact
on the health of our society

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.305 align:middle line:10%
and on the longevity
of our lives.

00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Our world has an
incredibly bright future.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We have the opportunity to
completely transform our world.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have the opportunity
to really overcome

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
some of the greatest
environmental difficulties

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and challenges that
we're experiencing today.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.250 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities
are hard to fathom.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, tapping into the
fundamental source of creation

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and utilizing that as the
power source of your society,

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:34.890 align:middle line:84%
has implications that
are unfathomable today.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, we're
talking about a society that

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
has access to
their solar system,

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to most likely their galaxy,
maybe their super clusters,

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe they are able to
go from one universe

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to another even, open wormholes,
travel at instantaneous speeds

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.350 align:middle line:90%
across the universe.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes
very dramatically

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:84%
from this simple
fundamental understanding

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that space is full
of energy, and it's

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:90%
the source of creation.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Although all this might
sound like something

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that should happen in
the very far future,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:90%
it is happening right now.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to
happen right now.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It will not be anything we can
do in 10 generations from now.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We are already on the
cusp of completely losing

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
control of our environment
and our capacity to survive.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
This must happen in
the next few decades.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.690 align:middle line:10%
In the next 10 to 15
years, a very strong effort

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:10%
from our society
must be to learn

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:10%
to do this vacuum engineering,
this quantum vacuum

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:10%
engineering, and
to lead the world

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:10%
into this bright future that
is right there in front of us.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:90%
We're so close.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So that we may birth our society
into a space society, a space

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
colony, with gravity control and
an infinite amount of energy.
