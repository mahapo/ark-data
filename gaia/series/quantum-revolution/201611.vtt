00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Gravity-- why
is it important?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore
the strength and significance

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.596 align:middle line:90%
of gravity in our universe.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:22.006 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Gravity is an
interesting force.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:10%
It was first
thought of by Newton

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:10%
as a force that attracted
things to each other.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It was unclear where
the force came from.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:10%
But it was described
by Newton as an effect

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:10%
related to the ether.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, Einstein rewrote
the concept of gravity

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:10%
as the result of
curvature of spacetime--

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:10%
that is that space and time can
curve to produce an attraction.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But that this attraction is not
component of the object itself,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but of the space around it-- the
curvature of space around it.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Typically, the concept is given
as the surface of a trampoline

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
or a flexible surface
that would bend

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
as you put a heavy
ball in the middle,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and then another ball would
appear to be attracted.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather use the
analogy of a tub

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
from which you pulled the
plug and have this vortex.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you put the rubber
ducky around this vortex,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:90%
it would appear to be attracted.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational force has
been a big problem in physics

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because it is not necessarily
well adapted to quantum theory.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
How does gravity interact
at the quantum scale?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It is unclear in
the standard model.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And the other forces,
as well, have not

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
been defined very appropriately.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that we know
there's gravity,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we know there is
electromagnetic fields,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
we know there is
the strong force,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
we know there is
the weak force--

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:90%
the four forces.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
where they come from.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
they got there.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what is the source
energy to produce these forces.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So from the
exploration I did, it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
became clear that
gravity was actually

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the result of the structure
of space spinning--

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
not just curving, but spinning.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So that the curvature
is secondary effect

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:90%
of the spinning of spacetime.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
What is important
here is that as I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
wrote the equation for
this spinning structure

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum curving
creating gravity,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it became clear that
gravity is actually

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
a secondary effect
of this structure

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime spinning.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And that when the spin
gets to a narrow neck,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
the gravity can become
very, very strong.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in our current
understanding of physics,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
we think of gravity
as the weakest force.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And this has created a lot of
issues in our capacity to unify

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:90%
gravity with the other forces.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that gravity is
actually the strongest force.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to tell you why.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
If a mass is large enough,
the gravitational field can be

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
so strong that even
electromagnetic fields cannot

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
escape it.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It's called a black hole.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So how can it be
the weakest force?

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
If you say this to a
physicist he will say,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
well, it's only because the
mass density or the energy

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
density in that region
of space is very high.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we make a distinction,
we isolate these things.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
We say mass is this,
and gravity is this.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But we've never been able to
measure mass without gravity

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
as if mass went and created
the gravitational effect,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:90%
or that gravity without mass.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we discovered
in this equation, is

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%
that it's all the same thing.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all spacetime spinning--

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
including mass, energy,
thermodynamics, and so on.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And so there is no distinction.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
you realize, well,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
when the vortex of spacetime--
when the vortex of the vacuum

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
fluctuation gets tight
enough, then gravity

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:90%
is extremely strong.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So then I calculated,
if that was true,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
how strong gravity would
become when it arrives

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
at the radius of a proton,
and what would be the energy

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:90%
level of that proton.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the proton
would have an energy level

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to a black hole, and
that the gravitational force

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of a black hole the
size of the proton

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
would be exactly
the strong force.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The strong nuclear force
is one of the four fundamental

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:90%
forces in nature.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
As its name implies,
the strong force

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest
force of the four.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible
for binding together

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
particles of matter

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:90%
to form larger particles.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
The other three are
gravity, electromagnetism,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.465 align:middle line:90%
and the weak force.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>> When we discovered
that force,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:90%
we didn't think it was gravity.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
We called it the strong force
because we thought that gravity

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:90%
is too weak to do the job.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:10%
In fact, gravity is
the strongest force.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is that force that's
holding the protons together.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, we measured a
mass of the proton as smaller

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:90%
than the mass of a black hole.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
However, the energy
density of the proton

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of vacuum
fluctuation shows clearly

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that the proton has the
energy of a black hole,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
since its gravitational
effect is exactly

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:84%
the one that would be produced
by a black hole that size--

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
not approximately, but exactly.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So when you calculate
it, what you get

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the
gravitational coupling

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
constant, which is the
coupling between gravity

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and the strong force.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We see that the strong force is
exactly the strength of gravity

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:90%
for a black hole proton.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:10%
And the energy that makes
the proton a black hole

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:10%
is the energy of the vacuum
structure spinning inside it.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:10%
What we measured when we
measured the mass of the proton

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:10%
is much smaller
because we measure

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:10%
only the energy
that's able to emanate

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:10%
from the surface of the proton.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:10%
And my holographic mass solution
demonstrates that very clearly.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:10%
All we measure is the
entropy of the proton, not

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:10%
its fundamental energy state.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:10%
So then the strong force is
gravity at the quantum level.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, then there's
another problem that emerge.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Why is the strong force
such a short range

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:90%
relative to gravity?

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
That is, when we scatter
protons away from each other,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
they unstick faster
than they would unstick

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:90%
if gravity was involved.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
That is, gravity
has a range that's

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
the square of the distance,
where the strong force

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
range drops at an
exponential rate

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
as you move the protons
apart from each other.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So confinement is much
stronger and drops much faster.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I had to solve this.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the solution
had to do with mass dilation.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Mass dilation occurs when
an object is accelerated

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:90%
near the speed of light.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:10%
Just like time changes as you
approach the speed of light,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:10%
Einstein discovered
in special relativity

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:10%
that there is a dilation
of the mass as well as you

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:10%
approach the speed of light,
so that the mass increases.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So the impact of
the proton spinning

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
at near the speed of light
on the structure of space

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is the strength of the strong
force in terms of gravity.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you scatter
the proton, when

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
you hit it with another
proton or with an electron

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and it scatters, it
changes its velocity.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So the mass dilation
drops as you move.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
The speed of rotation drops
as you move the proton away

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:84%
As the speed of rotation
drops, the mass drops.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
As the mass drops, the
gravitational force drops.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So I calculated how
fast that would all

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
drop as you move the protons
away from each other.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I got the exact same
range as the strong force,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
but using gravity
in consideration

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of special relativity as well,
which implies mass dilation.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So it gave me the correct
range and the correct strength.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:10%
This changes the picture.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a sudden, you
eliminate the strong force,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with
gravity, electromagnetism,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and a weak force.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But think of what we've learned
so far throughout this series.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:90%
We know spacetime is spinning.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
We know that when it spins,
we know that it produces what

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
we call mass across all scales.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's the result
of all these little particles

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
spinning together-- the
Plancks, the little particles,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of information
spinning together

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:90%
that makes up the mass.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of those little
spinning pieces of information

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
the little Plancks
spinning-- billions

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of them spinning together
to make a little proton.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Think of it like the smoothie
that you make in the morning

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
where you put all these
good stuff like the fruits

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables in your blender,
and then you turn it on.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the little
particles of all the good stuff

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you put in there going around
into this vortex dynamic

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
with the little particle going
from the inside to the outside

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and back through the
middle of the blender

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:90%
in this continuous circulation.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:10%
All of the sudden, we start
to realize, wait, gravity--

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:10%
this curvature in spacetime--

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:10%
may be the particles falling
in-- like the Planck field,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:10%
the flow of this fluid
structure of spacetime falling

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:10%
into the middle of the system.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And because of centrifugal
forces of the spin,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
the little particles
get eventually

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
gets ejected as well, and out
the middle comes the particle.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And that could be the
electromagnetic fields that

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:90%
are radiating from this system.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when
we write the equations,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what we find.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
We find the thermodynamic
radiating field

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic fields
emanating from the structure

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime spinning.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And we've solved this
more fundamentally

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
even because we were
able to actually use

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Brownian motion,
which is the position

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and relationship of particles
in a gas that produce

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
thermodynamic effects and
apply it to the Planck field

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
like if the Planck field
was a superfluid gas.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
When we ran this equation,
we got the holographic mass

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
solution.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
So it actually all worked out.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we found the viscosity
of the fluid of spacetime,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Brownian motion
of the fluid of spacetime,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and the thermodynamics of it.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've reduced
it to two forces,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
where we have the radiative side
being the centrifugal force--

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's at
the quantum level.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
At the quantum level,
it's the weak force.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And at the cosmological level,
it's the electromagnetic field

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that we experience,
and then the Planck

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
particles falling back in, which
is the gravitational force that

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:90%
holds it all together.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
All this is the result of the
Planck's field spinning again.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, unification
of the forces comes directly

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
from the Planck vacuum
oscillations becoming coherent

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
because of spin and producing
the dynamical effect that

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
in certain cases
looks like gravity,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and in other cases looks like
electromagnetic radiation,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or at certain scales looks like
the strong force or the weak

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:90%
interaction.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And all this emerged from
one set of understanding,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
one set of
fundamental principle,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
first principles that have to
do with the statistical entropy

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Planck field-- the
dynamics of the Planck field--

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
the holographic mass solution.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It's very exciting because
the field of physics

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
has been divided.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And the forces have been
put in as we measured them

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and as we discovered them, but
nothing had been explained--

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics under which
these forces have been created

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
and have emerged.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we end up with
the complete unified view

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:90%
of these forces.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they make and they
interact in very specific

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
relationship with each
other, and so they

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
define very specific
boundaries where

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:84%
these interaction
between the forces

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:90%
are in the proper relationship.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they make
these boundaries,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
we can find eventually the
quantization of spacetime

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that makes up all of the
scales we see in our universe.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
As we get this understanding
of the unification of the four

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
forces, we realize
that, clearly,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:84%
if we know the mechanism
that produced them--

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
which is the spin of
the Planck field--

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
we could go in the laboratory
and apply this knowledge

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to get remarkable
technology definitely.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about that.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
And as we developed our
understanding of these forces,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that means that we may be
able to affect these forces

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
in our body and
our consciousness

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
because our consciousness
is a flow of information.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the fundamental
flow of information

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
if these forces are the result
of this flow of information

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
in the universe-- it means that
we should be able to affect it.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So we could learn to increase
the energy level, for instance,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
of our body, or interact
with the structure of space

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is nourishing
our body instead of separating

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
our body from the structure
of space, which would

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
isolate it and make it ill.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Illness may actually
be the result

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of a decoherency of the
information in a region

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
of space in your body.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, then you
could, with your consciousness,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
recreate a coherency in the
body that was previously

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:90%
altered or broken.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:10%
And this might be actually
why there is a placebo effect.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
People talk about placebo
effect as if it's just

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
part of a statistical
analysis of a data set coming

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:90%
from a group of experiments.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-trivial thing that
you can give medicine to one

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:90%
person, and they get better.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can give a sugar
pill to the other person,

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
telling them it's
medicine that's

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:84%
going to make them better,
and they get better as well.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:84%
For 30 to some 50 in some
cases, percentile of a data set,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the placebo effect
is significant.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
How is that happening?

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like a miracle.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
You tell someone that
if they take this pill,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to have
this illness anymore.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And even though the pill has
nothing to do with the illness,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:90%
they get better.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
There is, even at
this point, tests

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that were made with
the placebo effect

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
where there was placebo
surgery that was done, where

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the surgeons, in some
cases, open the person

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and did the surgery and
the person got better.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And in other cases,
they opened the person,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't do anything in
their, close the person,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and send them home.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And because the person
thought they had the operation

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and that the problem was
fixed, well, then the problem

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:90%
was fixed.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Some 30% of the people showed
placebo surgery capabilities.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this might be the
result of our consciousness,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
or our intention,
or beliefs affecting

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
the information in the
structure of space,

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and acting upon the
forces of space and time

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:84%
so that the region of the body
in which there was decoherency

00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of the information could
get back into coherency even

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in mechanical ways in
which the illness implies

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that a mechanical
surgery would have

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to be made where the molecules
rearrange themselves to repair

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
the damage.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's remarkable.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And it implies
that not only does

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
this new understanding
of information

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:90%
in the structure of space--

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in the granular
structure of space--

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
is something that
can unify physics,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but it can unify
our understanding

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and information
relative to our existence.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:10%
Meaning that our
existence is really

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:10%
just an extension of these
fundamental physics that

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:10%
produced the forces,
that produced

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:10%
mass, that produced entropy,
that produced temperature,

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:10%
and so on, and that the
end result is one of us.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And the dynamics of
spacetime is actually

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
very much part of our experience
of awareness and consciousness.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
What's important to retain
here is that forces are not

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:90%
separate from each other.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
That forces in the universe are
a flow in certain circumstances

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
creating this effect,
and other circumstance

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:90%
creating this effect.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:90%
But that they're not separate.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
That spacetime, that
flow is into a vortex

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
produces what we call
mass at the same time

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:84%
as it produced what
we call gravity.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And that electromagnetic
fields is a result

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
of these dynamics
occurring in which

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
there is a force that's pulling
away from the system producing

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:84%
radiation, and magnetism,
and electromagnetic fields.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So that we understand
that this is one thing.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And that this one thing
is able to produce

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:84%
effects that appear
separate from each other,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And that we are part of this
unity of this one thing.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that the ultimate
emergence of our existence

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
may be the result of these
dynamics at different scales

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
eventually producing
the advanced dynamics

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that we see in a complex
human being with its capacity

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to self-reflect or to
have self-awareness.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
What's exciting
about understanding

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
the source of gravity
at a deeper level

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is that you realize that it
is part of something much more

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:90%
advanced and much more unified.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not some weird,
odd thing that's

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
happening in the universe that
we don't quite understand.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But that gravity is
a secondary effect

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:90%
of the dynamic of space itself.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It's all one thing.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You could think of gravity--

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
if you were to associate
an emotion to it,

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
you can think of
gravity as love--

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
what attracts, what holds
to the centripetal force

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
of the spin of spacetime,
holding like the mother holding

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:90%
the hand of the child.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that gives you an emotional
relationship to gravity.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not
only a beautiful metaphor,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
but as well that it gives
you a sense of belonging--

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
a sense of belonging to
something greater than you,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:84%
a sense of belonging to
mechanics of spacetime

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that you're embedded
in and that you're

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
participating in at the deepest
level of your existence.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
sense that you're not

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
separate from the
universe, that you're

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
part of this oneness
of the universe.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And that makes you--

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
in my case, it makes me
feel warm and cozy inside.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
We often think of gravity as
something heavy that pulls us

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to the center and keeps us stuck
to the surface of a planet,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
However, really, you
could think of gravity

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
as the result of a certain
set of information flow.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And you could think that
this information flow can

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:90%
be directed in any direction.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
That is, instead of
the information flow

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
flowing towards the
center of our planet

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and producing this force that
holds us to the surface--

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like Newton
had described it--

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
you could think of
this information flow

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
being able to be
directed since it's

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
coupled to the electromagnetic
field in a different direction.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And that would lead
to a different way

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:90%
of thinking of mass and energy.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But as well, in
technological development

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that could liberate humanity
from the surface of the planet.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So that humanity may enter a
larger gravitational field.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
gravitational fields

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
almost as the field
of information that

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
holds a certain
set of information

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of a planet, or
a solar system, or a galaxy.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:10%
And so going from
one set of gravity

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:10%
to another set of
gravity would be

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:10%
like graduating into a
larger set of information--

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:10%
for instance, graduating
to the set of information

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.460 align:middle line:10%
that's the galactic
community set of information.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you graduate to the
galactic set of information,

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
you would develop the technology
that can bring you there.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:90%
