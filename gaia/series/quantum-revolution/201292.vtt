00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people think
that space is empty.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.010 align:middle line:90%
But is it?

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore
the fullness of space

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to our
understanding of physics

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.532 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:25.976 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What is space?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:10%
Really when we think about it,
space is everywhere, as we saw.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Atoms are mostly
made out of space.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And the little jiggle that
we call the material world

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is just an electrostatic
field that's

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
interacting with each other
and makes it seem solid.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we have less
solid and more solid space.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about vacuum
fluctuation in physics,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
people have a tendency to think
we're talking about a chamber

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that we pull all the air out
and it's got a vacuum in there.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
we're talking about.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
energy in the space, right?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The vacuum fluctuation
is the energy

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that would still be there if
you remove all the molecules

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in a vacuum chamber.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something
that's already there.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that occurs only

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in a certain condition
or in a certain region

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or under certain
vacuum condition.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically
the jiggle of space

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, whether
we're talking

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
about space like intergalactic
space or interstellar space

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
or if we're talking about space
at the molecular structure

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
like the space between atoms,
the space inside the atom,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:90%
the space inside particles.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
All this space jiggle with
electromagnetic fluctuation.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And these vacuum fluctuations
appear in many different ways

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> When Paul Dirac wrote the
equations for quantum field

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
theory, it appeared that these
fluctuations were popping

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
particles in and out of
our reality continuously.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This was described
as the Dirac Sea,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
a sea of energetic
particle popping in and out

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:90%
of our reality continuously.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
deemed to be virtual

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
just because they're
not in existence

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
in our experience
for a very long time.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
they're not there.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
The word virtual
particles, here,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that they're
not real particles.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
they're only there

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:90%
for a very short amount of time.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And so these fluctuations
are essential to our equation

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in quantum theory.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Many of the subatomic
particles are

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
thought to emerge from
these fluctuations.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:10%
And this fluctuation
of the vacuum

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:10%
actually is the basis from
which, for instance, Higgs

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:10%
was able to write his
equation for the Higgs-Boson

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:10%
and for the Higgs
Interaction, the Higgs Field,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:10%
which was thought to
be the basis of mass,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:10%
or the emergence of mass.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:10%
So it really is omnipresent
in quantum field theory,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:10%
in quantum theory.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And it is, as well,
becoming more and more

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
utilized in our physics
all over the place,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
including at the
cosmological level when

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
we look at the surface of
black holes and their dynamics.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting that,
for the first time as well,

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
we were able to observe the
fluctuations of the vacuum

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
at the cosmological level near
the surface of a neutron star.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It seems a little strange to
think that particles can come

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
from nothing, from the vacuum.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that the
vacuum is not nothing.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are not able to
find anywhere in the universe

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%
where there is nothing.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
There is always
electromagnetic fluctuation.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And this field, the
quantum fluctuation

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum at
the quantum scale,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
has been deemed, as
well, zero point energy,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
because even at 0 Kelvin,
these equations show that there

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:90%
would still be fluctuation.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere where
we can stop the vacuum

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
from being the vacuum.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
This is very significant because
it means that it's everywhere.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's fluctuating.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
That means it has
energy everywhere.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:90%
And this energy is non-trivial.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of energy.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
energy that we require

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
to relate the energy
of mass, gravity,

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
the dynamic of our universe,
the creation of our universe,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and so on, then
all of a sudden we

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
realize that there is a source
of energy that's already

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
present that we call
vacuum fluctuation,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and that that source could
be the source of everything.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:10%
This means that there is
nothing either than the vacuum,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:10%
meaning that the vacuum
fluctuations, when they become

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:10%
coherent, are able
to produce what

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:10%
we call as our material world.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will discuss
that in more details.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But these vacuum
fluctuations, although

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
their earlier
interpretation was thought

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to be completely random, we're
discovering that they may not

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
be random, that they may
be polarized and organized

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways that when
they do become organized,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
they produce what
we call matter.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And as matter get together,
then the organization

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of this information
field, if you'd like,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
could become something
that we understand

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
as the source of what we call
awareness or consciousness.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:10%
So there's lots of implication
to understanding these vacuum

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:10%
fluctuations, how they work,
what's their energy level,

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:10%
and very importantly as we
describe, with the Casimir

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:10%
effect.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:10%
>> If enough of a gradient can
be created in the structure

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:10%
of the vacuum, we can get the
vacuum to produce work for us

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:10%
as it moves through
the gradient.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
When vacuum fluctuations push
or pump the Casimir plates

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, we
can theoretically

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
extract energy in what is
called the Casimir effect.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Consider that if this
is the energy that

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
is producing all of our reality,
then the amount of energy

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
we can extract is enormous.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, it's important to
realize when we're talking

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
about the vacuum, and we're
talking about these vacuum

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
fluctuations, we're not just
talking about vacuum out there

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
or vacuum inside atoms.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
vacuum inside of you.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:90%
You're made out of molecules.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%
You're made out of atoms.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the space inside of you,
which is 99.9999% percent you,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:90%
is fluctuating as well.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is a motion that
you may think as stochastic.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
And certainly,
that's the way it's

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
been thought of, meaning
that it is random,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:90%
it has no organization.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in general, it
has been ignored, because it's

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
thought to be irrelevant
since it all cancels out

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:90%
to the random function of it.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, science is
discovering that there are

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
regions of space
that are stochastic,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
or have random probability
distribution or pattern that

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
may be analyzed statistically,
but may not be predicted

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%
precisely.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
material cannot be seen.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But it is observed that
those regions are organized.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
matter emerges.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This might be, as well,
the source of black holes.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And matter might just be
smaller black holes coming out

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:84%
of bigger black
holes, and so on.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
whole new understanding

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of physics that emerge from
realizing that these vacuum

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
fluctuations that
you're made of may

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
be the source of
this material world

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of the material
world that is equal to mass,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:90%
or the structure of reality.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.594 align:middle line:10%
Although we think of these
fluctuations as random,

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:10%
randomness may only be
an artifact of the sample

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:10%
that you're looking at.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If you put your nose
into a Persian rug,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
particles of dust.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
see fibers of the wool

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:90%
that the carpet is made of.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And you might see a
few different colors

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of these other fibers being
there, and then grains of sand

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
because the carpet is not
perfectly clean, and dust,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
You might look at all this,
looked like a complete mess.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And you might not be able
to see a pattern at all.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And most likely, you won't.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking close,
you will not see a pattern.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But then as soon as
you back up and you

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
start getting more and more
of the field of vision,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:90%
then you start to see patterns.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
You start to see that there's
beautiful design of this rug.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You see the colors
actually working together

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:90%
to produce this amazing design.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
the universe or we

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
look at large
portion of space, we

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
might think that it
all looks random.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But actually, if we
looked big enough,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
we might actually find
order in something

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:90%
as large as a universe.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We've started to see
something like that.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We start to see large structure
on the cosmological scales

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
when we look at super clusters.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We see organization
where they start

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to look like they're organizing
as huge octahedron, tetrahedron

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
in the space, like a crystal.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And we see
organization, certainly,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:90%
at the molecular level.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
What we're discovering
is that when

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
vacuum itself is organized,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
it produces effects that
we see as our reality.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is very
profound because we

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
realize that all of reality
is part of one thing that

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:84%
is organized by the structure
of spin, by angular momentum,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.315 align:middle line:90%
by the geometry of the field.

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you
tried to define space.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And you find that OK,
well you can always

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
divide to smaller and
smaller and smaller space.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:90%
You would never reach the end.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You can divide one in half,
and then in quarters, and then

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
in eighths, and so on and
so on and so on and so on.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You will never
arrive at the end.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:84%
If there is energy there, then
it has an infinite potential.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this could
be a source of energy

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
with infinite potential for
humanity, a source of energy

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that would give us something
that could be thought

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
of as gravity control.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
application in realizing

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are all bathing
in this infinite,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
or very close to
infinite, level of energy

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:90%
that we call the vacuum.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering that this
vacuum energy is everywhere,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
producing everything.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we are starting
to think maybe

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:90%
we can become vacuum engineers.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We can engineer
the vacuum together

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to do a little bit of
what we want it to do.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we are
successful at this,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.565 align:middle line:90%
the implications are amazing.

00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
On an everyday level,
what you should take away

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
from this episode
is that you are

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
bathing in a field of energy.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Our body is made of
that field of energy.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It's called atoms,
molecules, or cells.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
This field of energy is flowing
in and out of the human body

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:90%
continuously.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:84%
When it flows out of you,
you call it thermodynamics.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
You call it the heat
of your body and so on.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
When it's flowing
into you, maybe you

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
call it thoughts
and the energy that

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:90%
propels you throughout the day.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Becoming aware of
this energy, becoming

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
aware of this source of reality,
allows you to maybe start

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate it or start to
interact with it in such a way

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that you feel more energized,
you feel more aligned,

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
you feel more
empathy for the rest

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of the things in the space.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:90%
You start to feel nature.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel one with
the structure of space

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
instead of feeling
isolated and separated.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You feel unified
with the universe.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And that might bring
you a sense of comfort,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
a sense of connection
that can lead you

00:15:51.890 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to incredible discoveries and
a sense of wellness that could

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:90%
be transformative in your life.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is really what
I wanted to convey

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
in these first few episodes,
is that this is real.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It's been measured.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:90%
We know it's there.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's rapidly
arriving to a place

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
where myself and many other
scientists are realizing, wow.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
This could be the
source of everything.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And we're finally getting there.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can start
to interact with it

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
in a completely different way.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The separation we experience
is really an illusion.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance
right now, we are

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the background
radiation of the galaxy.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:90%
We might not be aware of it.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But we are, because
it's in the space.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
We're interacting with all
the electromagnetic fields

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
levels of interaction

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
that we're not directly
conscious of, including

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
more gross ones like the
fact that we're breathing

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and our heart is beating and
our liver is doing its thing,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:90%
kidneys are doing--

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of things
happening that we're not

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
consciously manipulating.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:90%
They're still happening.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
And so we are
discovering that we

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
are profoundly deeper
and more complex

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
than initially we might
interpret ourself.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And that depth and
complexity emerge

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
not from some
philosophical ideas,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
but actually from, literally,
the mechanics of how

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:90%
the physical world emerge.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a concept that is
common amongst truth seekers

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:84%
or people on the spiritual path
that there are spiritual things

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.815 align:middle line:90%
and there are material things.

00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
That, as well, is a concept
of separation, fragmentation,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and isolation.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that what we call
the spiritual world may just

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
be the physics that we
have yet to understand

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
about the physical world, which
includes the information flows

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that we call consciousness
or awareness?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of a funny
thing when we say I,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:84%
because if this is all true and
the space is full and it has

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
infinite division possibility,
then everything has infinity

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And saying I is a little
bit confusing because when

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
you say I am who I am or I
am one, which I do you mean?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean you meaning
all of your cells?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean you meaning
all of your atoms

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%
and then all of your cells?

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean you meaning
all of your protons,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so on and so on?

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't really find the end
of I or the beginning of I

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
because you can
divide to infinity.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And to think of yourself as a
being with infinite potential

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:84%
might be a more accurate
understanding of yourself.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, to think of yourself
as just this agglomeration

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of cells that happened to
come together a few years ago

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and that will come apart
in the next few years

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
may not be an
accurate description

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of who you are in relationship
to the universe as a whole.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
At the deepest
level, who are you?

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you are the whole
individualized into you.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
say I, you're only

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:90%
describing one scale of you.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
There might be whole other
levels of scales of you

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're not aware of
because we haven't understood

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
this level of depth of reality
that we are discovering now.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And that depth and
complexity emerge

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
not from some
philosophical ideas,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
but actually from literally
the mechanics of how

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
the physical world emerge.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there
is spiritual things

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's material
things is, as well,

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:84%
a concept of separation and
fragmentation and isolation.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:10%
In fact, what we call the
spiritual world in these views

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:10%
