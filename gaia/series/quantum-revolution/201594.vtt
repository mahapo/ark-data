>> Is the universe
connected at all scales?

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how do
we experience it?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
discover that whatever we do

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:90%
influences the whole.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:10%
>> In the earlier episodes, we
have discussed that space time

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:10%
is not empty, that it's full
of these fluctuation of Planck

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:10%
oscillators.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And these Planck
oscillators can be

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
thought that as little
bits of information,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:90%
that this Planck field--

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
this granular
Planck field that's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
occurring at the very fine
structure of spacetime

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
spins itself into protons,
atoms, planets, stars,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, clusters, super
clusters, universes,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
each one being centered
by singularity,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%

and that is producing scales

the holographic nature

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
of the interference pattern of
these little Plancks creating

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
all these wave form produce a
holographic solution in which

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:90%
every point contains the whole.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
There is discoveries
that are occurring now

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
in physics in which we
are starting to understand

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
something that's been very
puzzling for many years

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in quantum theory.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Einstein called it spooky
action at a distance.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Einstein's spooky action
at a distance theory refers

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
to quantum entanglement, which
states that the measurement

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
of one particle will instantly
influence another particle

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how
far apart they are.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you modify one
particle, the other one

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
modifies itself
almost instantaneously

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.436 align:middle line:90%
across vast distances.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a consequence of the
exploration of quantum theory

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
early on, and Einstein thought
it was crazy and spooky.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, it was
confirmed in laboratory.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
In laboratory, we discovered
that this is true.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You can shoot a laser at a
carbon particle, for instance,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%
and it will emit photons.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:10%
And if the photons are
emitted away from each other,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:10%
they will travel through
a very specific vector,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:10%
and at a certain
distance, you can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:10%
put a polarizer on one
side and then a detector

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:10%
behind the polarizer
on both sides.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:10%
And so that the
polarizer will change

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:10%
the angle of the one for
time on one side and then

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:10%
the detector will pick up the
new orientation of that photon.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered that
it doesn't matter how

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:90%
far the distance the proton--

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the photons travel before
they get modified--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
before the one get modify.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The other one will be modified
instantaneously as well.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we've put the polarizer
close enough to the detector

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that even at the speed
of light, the information

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
could not be transferred
to the other one.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet the other one arrives
at the detector with exactly

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
the same polarization.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
This is called
entanglement in physics.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Particles can be entangled.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They have to be in a certain
state to be entangled.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we think that
there is particles

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that are
entangled and particles

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:90%
in the universe that are not.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that's true?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we don't.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we could
think that we could

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
have a universe in
which all particles are

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
entangled because they all
came out of the same point

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
just like the two photons
came out of the same carbon

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
particle.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that all particles that
came out of the early universe

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:90%
are entangled.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know because when
we wiggle the little particle

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
on the end of my finger here,
we don't know-- maybe there's

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
another particle somewhere
else in the universe that's

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
feeling that tickle.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's laughing,
but we don't know

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have that
side in our laboratory

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
to realize that when
I tickle this one,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:90%
it's entangled with this one.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
could be entangled.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
This appeared to me early on
in my exploration of physics.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear that maybe
some of the entanglement that's

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
occurring at the quantum level
is the same dynamics that

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:90%
is going on in black hole.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Entanglement at the quantum
level may be the result

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes that are developed
in the structure of space,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:90%
connecting particles together.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
However, wormholes are a
consequence of Einstein field

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
equations, not of
quantum theory.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
These would be
quantum size wormholes

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that are at the Planck scale
of the structure of space time.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
This new understanding was
developed by Leonard Susskind

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and is described
as ER equals EPR.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:90%
E stands for Einstein.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:10%
R and P are initials for
collaborators Boris Podolsky

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:10%
and Nathan Rosen.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:10%
So ER equals EPR suggests that
the key to their connection

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:10%
can be found in the spacetime
tunnels known as wormholes

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:10%
like subspace
shortcuts physically

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:10%
linking distant locations.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So ER equals EPR
is a way of saying

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:84%
wormholes is what
produce entanglement

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:90%
at the quantum level.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> This new view is emerging
as well from our equations now

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
where basically we're showing
that we have embeddedness

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes and black
holes from universal size

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
to subatomic size.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So think of the
black holes as being

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
the boundary that's created
by all the Plancks spinning

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
into one region, and the
wormholes, the vortices that

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
would be produced by
the spin as it goes--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
as it extends from the
black hole structure.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
ER equals EPR is basically
thinking of it a little bit

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
differently but is
as well very useful.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And it returns, and it has to do
with this holographic solution

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
in the standard model
that says that the entropy

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
or the temperature
of the black hole

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
is the result of all the
little Planck information

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the black hole.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
When this hawking
radiation happened

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
when the black hole absorbed
one little Planck particle

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
fluctuation of the
vacuum and emits one,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
these particles despair
of Planck particles

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
are entangled just
like the two photons

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that emerge from the carbon
particle in our experiment.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And so imagine this.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
One is falling into
the black hole,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
is entangled with it

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
but going away from
the black hole.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine
that particle gets

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
caught in the gravitational
field of another black hole.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And now it spirals in and falls
into the other black hole.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Now these two black
holes are connected

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
through this wormhole
that connected

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
the entanglement of
these two particles,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
a little teeny
Planck sized wormhole

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:84%
except there could be
many, many of the particles

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that fell into the
black hole and many,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
many that fell in
other black holes

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and so on and then
go back in time.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And think of all
this stuff coming out

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of one black hole, one point.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you will see,
you will visualize,

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
you will understand that
all of these wormholes

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
would be like a spider
web of information network

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
emanating and connecting
all of the black holes,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
all of the singularity, all of
the particles in our universe.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a web of
information exchange,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and this is really--

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
what our equations are
showing is that when

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the information is exchanged
between the interior

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of the singularity, the
interior of the black hole,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
no matter at what scale,
its exchange with the hole

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
as well through the
wormhole network.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the exchange
happens between one particle

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and the whole, the
energy that it produce

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
is what we call mass.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we
call our reality.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
This network of
information has been imaged

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:90%
and is being discovered now.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Recently, we have
seen that when we

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
look at very large
structures in the universe,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
they appear to be connected
through these filaments that

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:84%
connects very large like
super clusters and cluster

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:90%
structures in our universe.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at that
from far as a whole,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
it looks very similar to a
neuron network in your brain.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
This is all very
interesting evidence

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of scaling of this network
across very large and very

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:90%
small.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the network structure
of all the wormholes

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
occurring at the Planck
scale and then these network,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
making larger network at the
proton scale and then these

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
making larger network at
the solar system scale

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and at the galactic
scale and so on so

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that everything is connected to
this invisible Planck structure

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
network of information,
moving bits of information

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
across the universe so that when
one bit falls into a black hole

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
here, it can come out
somewhere else in the universe.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
If this is true,
then the concept

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
of evaporation of
black holes disappear.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We are now no longer
losing energy.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
The energy is always
recovered in the universe

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.255 align:middle line:84%
as it exchange information
across all nodes.

00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine the internet as
an analogy for the structure

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:84%
of our universe where the hubs
of the internet and the servers

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
of the network are the black
holes and all the different

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
scales, and the connection of
the networks are the wormholes

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
connecting all the hubs.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a neural
network of the universe.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything we observe in the
universe in terms of the energy

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of a system, in terms of the
relationship of systems with

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
each other like the forces and
all this is actually the result

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of the information moving
through the network.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
If I isolate one particle
because it doesn't

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
have much surface, not
as much information

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
can move through the system.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The mass of that
particle will be

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
smaller than the black
hole in the universe

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
like the center of a galaxy
in which a lot of information

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
can be exchanged
across that hub.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Smaller hub, smaller server,
less energy, larger server,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
larger hub, more
energy, and as we know,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:90%
energy is equivalent to mass.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, we start
to see this network structure

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
emerging that is
from the universe

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
all the way to
subatomic particle

00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in which we are embedded
in somewhere in the middle.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And our existence is
actually part of this flow.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So this network connects
all these scales.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That means that a
bit of information

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that falls into one
part of the network

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
can come out somewhere
else in the network

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and then fall in again and
come out somewhere else.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
that information

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
would have some large
feedback relationship,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and we are starting
to discover that.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
We are starting to discover
that light in our universe

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
curves back on itself
and comes back on itself.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We-- and this is
very, very recent,

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
so it's very exciting
because I predicted

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that that should be
the case, especially

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
if we're living inside a black
hole that is our universe.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So this information
network feedback

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
feed forward structure is
the entropy of our network.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
That is-- and this
happened just recently.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:90%
I got very excited about it.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We were writing equations
in my laboratory.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:84%
We ran out of
space on our board,

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
so we started writing
on the windows.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And we were writing all of
these equations on the windows,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and it became clear
that we could express

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
the holographic mass solution
which I had expressed

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
in a very geometric
way from the theory

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
of entropy or
statistical entropy

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
or straight from first
principle of thermodynamics.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
that we can actually back up

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
the equations that are
more geometric equations,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the holographic math solution
I proposed initially,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
into equations that describe
the temperature of systems

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and their entropy,
their energy level.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as each
server on the network

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is riding the information onto
our hard drive and the energy

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that it takes for it to do
that and the temperature that's

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
created by the server
that usually has fans

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:90%
to take the temperature out.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It means that this
whole structure

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed fundamentally
from first principle

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
from thermodynamics and entropy,
that energy thermodynamics

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
entropy, mass, gravity,
electromagnetism, and all

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
these things can be actually
described from this one

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
understanding, this one
set of information network

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that connects everything
in the universe

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing is
independently doing its thing.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It just appears that way
because we observe something

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and we think it's independent
from the rest of the universe,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:90%
and we say it has this mass.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:90%
It has this energy.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:90%
It has this entropy.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
It has this
temperature, not knowing

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that this mass, this entropy,
this temperature, and all

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
this stuff is the result
of this thing interacting

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of their universe.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:90%
That is beautiful.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
equations are showing,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and it is extremely precise.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
It's showing this in a
very, very strong way,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
telling us at the very
fundamental level of creation

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that everything is connected
through this incredible network

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of information
that is circulating

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:90%
through our universe.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That has deep
implications because it

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
means that anything
you do it means

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that anything that changes
anywhere is influencing

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
everything else in the universe,
that every action produces

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
a reaction everywhere
in the universe.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And although-- however,
it's important to understand

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that they're a
scale relationship.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is hierarchy in the
influence of DNA formation

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
There is influences that
are larger, for instance,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
our sun has a huge influence
on the solar system

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and all the planets in it.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But our planets only makes less
than 1% the mass of our sun,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
so they have much less
influence on our sun

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
than our sun has
influence on the planets.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
If the sun blows a sun flare
in the direction of the Earth

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and blows the atmosphere
of the Earth away,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
the Earth doesn't
really have a recourse.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It cannot blow back at the
sun and blow the atmosphere

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of the sun away.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a relationship of
temperatures, energy, mass,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
entropy across the
different scales.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
However, every single
scale is influencing

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
every single other scale as
well, maybe in a minimum way

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
or in the maximum way, but
the whole is connected.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
happens in the universe

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is in some ways recorded
by the structure

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:90%
of the network of spacetime.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And that is profound.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that from
any point in the network,

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:90%
we can have access to the whole.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us that everything
we measure in our world

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
is actually a function
of that thing interacting

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:90%
with everything else.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:84%
There is huge
implication in terms

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of technology and understanding
of energy and temperature,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
thermodynamics, and
so on, but there's

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
implication as well
in understanding

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of systems
self-organizing, systems

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware, awareness,
consciousness, all

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
this can most likely
be extrapolated

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
from this new view.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And we will discuss this
in further episodes.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
What's important to
extract from this episode

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe is
connected at the deepest level

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
through wormholes
black hole interaction

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and that it's connected
at all scale, not just

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
linear connection at one
scale but at all scales

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and that we're part of
this connected universe

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and that whatever happens
in the universe, whatever

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:90%
we do influence the whole.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And that changes our sense of
ourselves, of our universe,

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to it, and it

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.880 align:middle line:84%
changes ourselves-- our sense of
responsibility in the universe.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:10%
