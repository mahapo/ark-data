00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that
ancient civilizations may have

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:90%
possessed advanced technologies?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.400 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
explore that probability.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.814 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So now, we've established
that the universe creates

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:10%
through the structure
of the vacuum.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:10%
That the structure of
the vacuum spinning

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
produces the material
world from the very small

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:10%
of the sub-Planck to the Planck
to the protons to the atoms

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:10%
to the planets, the stars, the
galaxies, the super clusters,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:10%
the universes.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And that universes are
birthing each other

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:90%
as they emit particles.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've established that
in this creation structure

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
of the structure
of spacetime, we

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
end up with planets
around stars everywhere.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:84%
That stars most likely
have planets around them

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that form as the result of the
fluid dynamic vorticity that's

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
being generated in the structure
of spacetime around them.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And that many of these
planets could host life.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, that
that life could

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
be millions of years ahead of us
in their technical development.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Which would mean
that they most likely

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
have discovered how to
interact with the structure

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
With the structure of the
vacuum to open wormhole,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to travel through black holes,
to go across the universe,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
to emerge on this side of our
galaxy and discover our planet.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We briefly looked at
the history of man.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And talked about how there
is some evidence that there

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
was contact with advanced
civilization in our deep past

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
in an era that now people
are starting to call

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:90%
the pre-cataclysmic era.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Approximately 10,000
to 12,000 years ago,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
before the Great Flood,
which most likely corresponds

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
to the meltdown of
the last Ice Age.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:10%
This flood that was reported
by over 300 different cultures

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:10%
all around the world talking
about the end of an earlier

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:10%
civilization that was very
advanced that was destroyed

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:10%
by a great cataclysm that
involved a rise of the ocean

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:10%
and the flooding of all of
these ancient civilization.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
When the ancient people talk
about this advanced ancient

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
civilization, they talk
as well of their capacity

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:90%
to fly in the air.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
They talk about their capacity
to travel in the solar system

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:90%
at least, if not in the galaxy.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:10%
And to have interaction
with beings from the stars--

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:10%
star beings or sun gods.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:10%
This is consistent in
a very strong way all

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:10%
around the world from all these
different civilizations, which

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:10%
supposedly had no
contact with each other.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The probability that that would
occur if these events were just

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
fictitious, that all of these
civilizations around the world

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
would have developed the
same myths, never mind built

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
similar buildings, is very low.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the way they
built their buildings,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
none of these
civilizations claimed

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to have built some of these
remarkable pyramidal structures

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that you find all
around the world.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
A few decades ago,
we only thought

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
there was a few of
these buildings,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
these pyramids around the
world, most known ones,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the ones in Egypt, the one
in Teotihuacan in Mexico.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of the ziggurats
in Iran and in Persia.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have discovered
many, many more pyramids

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
In some regions, we've
discovered thousands

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of them.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
We found some in China.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
We found some under
the water near Japan.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Recently, using
LADAR technology that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:10%
can see under the foliage
in southern Mexico

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:10%
and in Guatemala, we've
found thousands and thousands

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:10%
of pyramids were
present, which would

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:10%
require that millions and
millions of people lived there.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
starting to discover

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
the evidence of this
earlier civilization

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
civilization talked about.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
When they talked
about those buildings,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
they didn't show
themselves building them.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
There is no hieroglyphs,
for instance, in Egypt,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
on any wall in
Egypt, that showed

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:90%
them building the pyramids.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:84%
They all said that the sun
gods came from the stars

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and built these
buildings on our planet.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And taught the
humans at the time

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
how to calculate, how to
engineer, how to write,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
a common theme when

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
we look all around the planet
in all of these traditions.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's remarkably consistent.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
obvious similarities

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
is the engineering
that you see in Peru

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
engineering you see

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, some of the
engineering you see in Turkey.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
places around the world where

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:84%
you have these enormous
stones that were moved,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that were placed
with precision that

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%
exceeds anything we have today.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about
enormous stones, some of them

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
are smaller, in excess
of 20 ton, 30 ton.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are much larger
in excess of 200, 300 ton.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes moved across
valleys and mountain range.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Certain places in
Peru where walls

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
with blocks that exceed
100 ton to 200 tons

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
are found that were
quarried in mountain

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
ranges across from
where they're found.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So that the rocks would
have had to be quarried

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
at the top of these mountains,
brought down into the valley,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and up another mountain to
be placed where they are.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
stones, for instance,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
at the Valley Temple in
Egypt, are 200 tons blocks

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that come from
fairly far away that

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
are lined with 100 ton granite
blocks that comes from hundreds

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:90%
of miles away.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the cut of these
blocks is remarkable.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:10%
Some of the blocks actually
exceeds 1,000 tons.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:10%
1,000 ton block are
extremely difficult to move.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:10%
And yet, they've been moved
across very large distances,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of miles across rivers.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
some of the stones that

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
are found in Egypt, for
instance, at the Ramesseum

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Temple, where a statue
that was thought

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to be a statue of
Ramses II is found,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that weighs in
excess of 1,000 ton.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from long
distance from where it's found.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of the monuments
we see around the world

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
may be from a much
formidable age

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
than what they are
thought to be today.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
archaeologists dated them

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
with the later people
that found them.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And that used them
in their culture

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:10%
because they thought they were
the monuments of the gods.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And that they built a
whole religion around it.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But these monuments may pre-date
this culture by a long shot.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they may come
from pre-cataclysmic flood.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they may exceed
10,000 to 12,000 years.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And in some case, be as old
as 30,000 to 40,000 years.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the geological
evidence on these building

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.175 align:middle line:90%
supports these claims.

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It's important because that
means the history of humanity

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is vastly different than
what we think it is.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is evidence
that the human genome may not

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
be the result of
linear evolution

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
from monkeys to
eventually Homo sapiens.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:10%
There is all of a
sudden, a huge spike,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:10%
which is thought
to be missing link

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:10%
in the evolution
of, for instance,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:10%
the cranial cavity of the Homo
sapiens from the Neanderthal.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:10%
These changes that
occurred don't

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:10%
seem to be part of
a natural evolution.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden the cranial
cavity doubling in size.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:90%
The brain doubling in size.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
The eyes are getting bigger.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
The loss of hair.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:10%
All this stuff doesn't seem
to be in the natural evolution

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:10%
of human beings, the result
of natural transformation

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:10%
as a result of adaptation
to the environment.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually, that there
was an intervention

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that changed the
genes of the structure

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution of our planet.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
produced a being

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:90%
that was much more advanced.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
That might have been the result
of the splicing of genes that

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
made this sudden transformation
of the evolution of hominids

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden producing
the Homo sapien.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Which may have taken
much, much longer

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:90%
without this intervention.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And I completely off track?

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Am I the only one thinking this?

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it completely crazy
ideas that extraterrestrials

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
may have come to our
planet and altered

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
or even see that
life on our planet?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:10%
Francis Crick, one of the
most venerated geneticists

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:10%
on our planet, the man
that received the Nobel

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:10%
Prize for discovering
the structure of DNA,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:10%
wrote papers in 1973
talking about this.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Panspermia theory suggests
that life on Earth

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
did not originate on our
planet, but was transported

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
here from somewhere
else in the universe,

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
perhaps spanning galaxies
and solar systems.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Microorganisms that
were unintentionally

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:84%
distributed by space dust,
meteorites, asteroids,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and comets landed on Earth
and started life here.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Crick thought that this
theory was improbable.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But he wrote that it had
to have been implanted

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
by advanced civilization
that came to the Earth

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and then planted the genes
that produce life on Earth.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, some of the
genome structure on our planet

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
was altered to produce the
evolution we see today.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:10%
Others, like William Brown,
one of our biophysicists

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:10%
and molecular biologists at the
Resonance Science Foundation,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:10%
was able to identify
the specific alteration

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:10%
of the gene that
happened that produced

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:10%
the doubling of the cranial
cavity of the Homo sapiens

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:10%
from the earlier hominids.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
When he discovered this, it
looked highly suspicious.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:10%
It looks like an
alteration of the gene that

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:10%
is typical of what we do
today when we alter genes

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:10%
in GEMAL type of engineering.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it may be that not
only this advanced ancient

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
civilization may have
been on our planet

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
prior to our written history,
but that this earlier

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:84%
prior civilization
was the source

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of the eventual evolution of
Homo sapiens on our planet.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I
was fortunate enough

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do an autopsy
on some remains of mummies

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
they are found in the
Paracas region, where

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I was able to test
some of the tissues

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to sample
from these remains.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
we were able to get

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:84%
from these remains not
only mitochondrial DNA,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:90%
but as well, the nuclear DNA.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the material was
very malleable still.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had retained a very
high level of coherency.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And so nuclear DNA was
able to be extracted,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
although the samples were
approximately 2,300 years old,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
according to the
carbon dating we did.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondrial DNA,
the DNA of the mother

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
showed some alteration and
dilatation of the DNA genome

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that placed strangely the origin
of the race of the mother,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
not in the Paracas region,
but in the Black Sea region.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the Haplogroup
of that genome source

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
was not localized
in South America.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
In that region of the
Black Sea, is found,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
as well, elongated skulls that
resemble very much the Paracas

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:90%
skulls.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's interesting
unto itself.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But when we analyzed the nuclear
DNA, or the father's side DNA,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:84%
has a very low percentage
match to the human genome.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So far, we haven't
finished the analysis.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And we should get it done
as well by third party.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I cannot
certify these results.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But so far, preliminary
results show

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that the percentage
match to the human genome

00:16:53.330 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is in the ratio of 3% to
5%, which is extremely low.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a
banana has a match

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
to the human genome
of almost 40%.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
So 3% to 5% match is nowhere
close to a Homo sapien.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:10%
So this means that
they might be,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:10%
if this is correct, if the
analysis was done correctly,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:10%
this might be something that
was a branch of hybrids that

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:10%
had human contact and maybe
extraterrestrial contact

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:10%
as father and mother.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And that this branch of
hybrid survived all the way

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:90%
into almost first century AD.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:10%
And we can attribute
some of the buildings

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and some of the
traditions that we

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:10%
have all around the
world about contact

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:10%
with these higher
extraterrestrial being

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:10%
or with hybrids, which is,
as well, in these tradition.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:90%
They were called semi gods.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
They were the sons and daughters
of the intermix between the sun

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
gods and the humans.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
This is described in
many of these tradition.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's even described in the
Bible where the sons of gods

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:90%
come to the Earth.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:84%
They find the women
of men beautiful

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and have children
with them and so on.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:90%
So is this a possibility?

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, you have to
look at the data objectively.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The data around the
world is overwhelming.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
The consistency across all
these civilizations, traditions,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and morses describing
this is remarkable.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The building consistency and
techniques is remarkable.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The advanced technology
required to move

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
such large masses
for long distances

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and their capacity
to assemble them

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in buildings with the
level of precision

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that exceeds what we
have today is remarkable.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is overwhelming.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
to be skeptical.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Skepticism, however,
is different

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
than close-mindedness.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
One must analyze
the data and come

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to the appropriate conclusions.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
the data is telling

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
a story vastly different
than the story we've

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
been told about the
history of humanity

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and the development
of the human genome.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Why were these people
building pyramids?

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Why this shape ?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
How come we find this
all around the world?

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, the pyramidal
structure, the pyramidal shape

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
have the capacity to
concentrate electromagnetism

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
at their vertices,
at their apex.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
That has been
measured now clearly.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And as well, we
have a relationship

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to the resonance
cavity of spacetime,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
which, as I've described
in our equation,

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:90%
is tetrahedral in nature.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Edge to edge
tetrahedral relationship

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:90%
produce octahedron cavities.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Octahedron cavities are
pyramidal shape structure.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So it may not be a coincidence
that these very specific shapes

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
are found all around
the world, from all

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
these different traditions if
the source of the knowledge

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
was coming from the
same source, which

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
was the sun gods that were
traveling the world educating

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:90%
the humans.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Are these building technologies?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
part of a technology.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they are missing
the heart of the technology.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
They're missing the power
source at the center.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
When we look at complexes,
like Giza, or when

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
we look at Saqqara, or other
complexes, such as Teotihuacan,

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
or complexes like you
find at Chichen Itza,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and so on, you see that
there is some plan that

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
went on there in the way
they arranged the buildings.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And the way they arranged the
resonance cavities at Saqqara,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
for instance, with these
large diorite boxes that

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
are found under the
ground that would

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
be like resonance cavities.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
this as a map from above,

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
they almost look like
electronic circuits

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that you think might have
been the development of a very

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization city kind
of structure in which energy

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
was transmitted throughout
the city in a different way

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
than we transmit energy today
with cables and poles and so

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.780 align:middle line:10%
Where the energy is
transmitted through resonance

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:10%
cavities across the land.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:10%
And through water
structures, as well,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:10%
that are found all
in these regions,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:10%
where water was flowing
through pyramids and so on.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:10%
All kinds of direct
relationship and analogy

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:10%
including the orientation
of some of these buildings

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:10%
You would have to have
a global knowledge

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:10%
of the structure of our
planet to be able to place.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So all this tells
us that, yes, these

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
could have been the remains
of advanced technology,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:84%
but that we're missing
the power source that

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
used to be in them to light
up all this technology

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Where did it all go?

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
If they were all here.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Was a simple cataclysm, like
the end of the last Ice Age

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
be enough to wipe
out evidence of such

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:90%
an advanced civilization?

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:90%
I believe so, absolutely.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The rise of the waters
during the last Ice Age

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
was in meters and meters
covering the land.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%
There was most likely
impact of a large meteorite

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that produced the meltdown
of the last Ice Age.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the destruction of a
civilization even parts

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:90%
of continent is very plausible.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So we are discovering
the evidence

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:90%
of that earlier civilization.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's not present.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands and
thousands of pieces of evidence

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
haven't been put together

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
because of our
fragmentation of science,

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
because of our tendency to say,
oh no, this is this tradition.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's got nothing to
do with this tradition.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And they had no contact
with each other, all this.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We have maybe misinterpreted
much of day evidence

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that we had discovered earlier,
but there's more and more

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
evidence emerging everywhere
on the world right now.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
From the galactic
perspective, it's

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:84%
easy to see our
world as unified.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to think of all
the humans as brothers

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and sisters of one planet.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:10%
From a limited perspective
of an individual

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:10%
on one piece of the continent
delimited by artificial lines

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:10%
that we have called countries,
and the cultural differences

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:10%
that we see between
these countries,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:10%
it's difficult to see the
unity in our endeavor.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Although, this is
becoming easier

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
with the instance of
internet than the exchange

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And people traveling
across the world.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:10%
And realizing that
a family in Africa

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:10%
has the same aspiration and the
same love for their children

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:10%
than a family in Canada
or a family in the US.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We are just starting to realize
the unity in our endeavor.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And discovering a
larger community

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that could involve a
whole galactic structure

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
would help us unify
our human endeavor.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Unify our differences.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And realize that we are
all one culture that's

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
part of a larger cultural
structure that we could

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
call our galactic community.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Which is most likely part
of a larger culture that

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
could be the cluster, the local
cluster, or the super cluster,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:90%
even the universe.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what's important to
remember from this episode

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is that not only are we
not alone in the universe,

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
but there is a lot of
evidence on our planet

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that our planet was visited
early on in our history.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:84%
That it even developed
very advanced culture

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:90%
and civilization on our planet.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
The remains of which are
present all around the world.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And that we're
discovering these remains.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just one thing,
like the pyramids of Egypt,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
or the pyramids at
Teotihuacan, but that we're

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
discovering thousands
and thousands

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
of these different structures
all around the world.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Stones that were too large for
us to move even at this time

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
That gives very strong
evidence that there

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
was contact with
advanced civilization

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:84%
long before our written history
in this last 5,000 years.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And that the rediscovery
of this knowledge

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:10%
can lead humanity to a
whole new way of interacting

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:10%
with itself and with the rest
of the galactic community.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:90%
