>>I'm Noah Levine, Buddhist
meditation teacher.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:10%
The following is a
guided meditation

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:10%
in loving kindness,
a development of ease

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:10%
and well-being for oneself
and the wishes for ease

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
and well-being for all beings.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You can start this meditation
by finding a seated posture

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and allowing your eyes to close.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Beginning by
releasing any tension

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.281 align:middle line:84%
that your body may be holding,
softening your face, shoulders,

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:90%
belly.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Bringing to mind
your own deepest

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.314 align:middle line:84%
wishes for happiness,
for ease, for contentment

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
as we reflect on all of the
ways that we seek happiness

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.561 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime that are
ultimately unfulfilling,

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.186 align:middle line:90%
unsatisfactory.

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Turning towards yourself
in your own heart and mind

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and begin by wishing
ease for yourself,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
saying to yourself in your
own mind, may I be at ease.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Here in this present moment,
may I be at ease with my body

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:90%
just as it is.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
May I be at ease with my
mind even if it's busy, loud,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:90%
critical.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
May I come to a level of
acceptance, friendliness,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and ease in my own skin.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in and out as
though you could breathe

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.595 align:middle line:90%
into your own heart center.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:10%
Breathing this wish for ease
and repeating the phrases

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:10%
over and over, may I
be at ease with myself

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:10%
just as I am with
the pains in my life,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:10%
with the joys, with the process
of aging, sickness, and grief.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
May I come to be at ease in the
reality of the human condition.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And we all live with a mind that
judges, criticizes, compares.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault.
Wishing, training your mind

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
with friendliness
and compassion.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.335 align:middle line:84%
May I be at ease with this
mind and all of its bad habits.

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:10%
May I be at ease with this
body and all of the ways

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:10%
that it craves pleasure,
rejects pain, with my heart

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.155 align:middle line:10%
and the emotions, some
pleasant and some unpleasant.

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
May I come to be at ease in
this heart, in this body,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.575 align:middle line:90%
with this mind.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And beginning to expand from
yourself to wishing this ease

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and well-being, to extending
this unconditional friendliness

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.023 align:middle line:84%
out to your loved ones, friends
and family, radiating kindness.

00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
May you be at ease
with your difficulties,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
with your challenges,
and also with the joy,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the happiness that
you experience

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
sending loving kindness, wishes
for ease to your loved ones.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And extending beyond the
near and dear to friends,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to colleagues.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you're in a very
large, open space surrounded

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
by all of the people
you know or have known.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Just like you, they're
seeking happiness.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.065 align:middle line:84%
Just like you, they
wish to be at ease.

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
As the ultimate act
of friendliness,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
wishing for the ease,
happiness, and freedom

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:90%
from all of these people.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
May you all be at ease.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
May you find a way in
the midst of the reality

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
of your life, the 10,000
joys and 10,000 sorrows

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.942 align:middle line:10%
May you learn to be at
ease, to respond wisely,

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:10%
to have compassion
for the pains,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:10%
non-attached appreciation
for the joys.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:10%
May you be at ease.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:10%
And expanding further
to include even

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:10%
our enemies, the difficult
people who have hurt us,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:10%
offended us, betrayed
us, the people we

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:10%
judge, people with
different political beliefs,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:10%
people who have caused harm.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They too, underneath
the confusion,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
underneath the suffering,
wish to be at ease.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
As an act of compassion
and forgiveness,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
sending loving kindness
even to your enemies.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I see your suffering.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I know you're confused, and
I wish for your happiness.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.164 align:middle line:90%
May you be at ease.

00:07:24.164 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
May you find a way
to heal what needs

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.721 align:middle line:84%
to be healed so you
don't cause so much harm.

00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
May you be at ease in your
own being with your pain,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:90%
with your joy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
we expand outward

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
to all beings,
including ourselves,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our families,
our associates, everyone

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
you've ever met,
including your enemies,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and everyone you've never met,
the 7 billion human beings,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.735 align:middle line:90%
all seeking happiness.

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be at ease.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
May all beings do what needs
to be done to free themselves

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
from the causes of suffering,
from the clinging, the greed,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.966 align:middle line:90%
the hatred, the confusion.

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
May all beings heal
what needs to be healed,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:84%
to find the ease, contentment,
and well-being that

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.945 align:middle line:90%
is possible in this lifetime.

00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Beyond humans to all
living creatures,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
from the smallest insects
to the largest mammals,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:90%
may all life be honored.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be at ease.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Feel your breath entering and
exiting, radiating kindness,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:90%
the intention of friendliness.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Whether you feel it sincerely
or not, training your heart

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and mind with these wishes.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be at ease.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And before we end,
coming back to your body.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha once said, "We could
search the entire universe

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and never find anyone more
worthy of our love and kindness

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:90%
than ourselves."

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to start from the inside
in order to genuinely love.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
We must learn to love ourselves.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:90%
May I be at ease.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be at ease.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:90%
May I be free from suffering.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.315 align:middle line:84%
May all beings be
free from suffering.
