[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.450 align:middle line:10%
MAN: Sorry to break it to you.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Funny, you don't look Buddhist.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I used to think meditation
was for nice, happy people who

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be nicer and
happier or something.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
dissatisfied with what

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing
in order to be

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:90%
willing to try something else.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm Noah Levine, and I'm
a Buddhist meditation

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
teacher from the
Against the Stream

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Buddhist Meditation Society.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'm going
to talk about Buddhist

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.585 align:middle line:10%
meditation practice.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And relaxing into
your body, releasing

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
any unnecessary tension,
softening your eyes, your face,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
releasing the jaw and
shoulders, letting

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
go of any tension
in your stomach,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
finding the place in your body
where you feel the breath.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up around
Buddhist meditators.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
From a very young
age, I witnessed

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
my parents meditating.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:10%
But in my youth, I
dutifully rebelled

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:10%
against all things
spiritual and found punk

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:10%
rock music at a very young age.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:10%
And it spoke to the angst, and
energy, and dissatisfaction

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:10%
that I felt with the world.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:10%
I started using drugs and
alcohol at a very young age

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:10%
and started getting
in trouble, started

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:10%
getting sent to juvenile
hall and getting

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:10%
arrested for drugs and crime.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:10%
At 17 years old sitting in Santa
Cruz, California juvenile hall

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:10%
where I had grown
up-- and I'd been

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:10%
in and out of that juvenile
hall over and over many times

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:10%
over the years-- and
at this last time,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:10%
the last time I was there,
something shifted for me.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I, for the first
time in my life took

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:90%
responsibility for my actions.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Up to that point, all of the
suffering, all of the problems,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I blamed on society.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I blamed on the system,
the police, the hippies.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.222 align:middle line:84%
It was the hippies fault that
I was so angry or confused.

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:10%
But there was a turning
point, where I was suicidal,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:10%
and I had had a suicide attempt.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:10%
And I woke up in
this padded room.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And I got a phone call from my
father who lives in New Mexico.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And I was in California.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:10%
And I was 17 years old.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:10%
And he said, maybe, you're
ready to try meditation,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:10%
Buddhist meditation.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And he gave me very simple
mindfulness of the breath

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:10%
meditation instructions.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I can remember
feeling desperate enough

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to try anything, but
with a little bit

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
of an attitude of like,
well, you know, dad,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I need some real help.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:90%
How about a lawyer?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
How about something
that will actually

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:90%
get me out of the situation.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And he explained to me that
actually he was giving me

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:10%
a tool that had the potential
to get me the freedom

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:10%
that I sought, not
from the institution,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:10%
but from the suffering
that I was in.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I realized something
that I had never known up

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
until that time,
which was I don't have

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention to my mind.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Up to that time,
my mind was saying

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
take drugs, and steal,
and lie, and cheat,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and violence, and all that.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
following my emotions

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.564 align:middle line:84%
in my mind and all of the
suffering that was created.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
practice mindfulness,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:90%
there was this revelation.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
My mind doesn't have my
interest, my best interest,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:90%
my heart's best interest.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.632 align:middle line:10%
And then I have to
learn to ignore it.

00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:10%
And I have to learn
to disobey it.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:10%
And that was a
real turning point.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
From there, first
couple of years,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I was locked up for
about nine months.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:10%
And then I got out.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And I was meditating.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:10%
And I would use meditation
occasionally, but not deeply,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:10%
not regularly.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:10%
I think I used
meditation the way

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of
people use prayer,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:10%
as a sort of in emergency only.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:10%
Like, oh, please get
me out of this one.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.047 align:middle line:10%
And, I think, I used
meditation like that.

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:10%
I'd come back to
the breath when I

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:10%
got stressed, when
I got afraid, when

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:10%
I got some suffering arising.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:10%
A couple of years
later, at 19 years old,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:10%
I got myself into
some more trouble.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:10%
I got clean and sober.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:90%
I got off of drugs.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I became drug-free, got my
life together on some level.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I had an apartment, and
a car, and a motorcycle.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I was going to college.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But I still had this delusion,
what I now know as a delusion,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that the material world
would provide my happiness.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
That if I got the car, if
I got the relationship,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
if I got the stuff,
then I would be happy.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
at 19 years old,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
half-assed meditation practice,
miserable, and also in trouble

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.599 align:middle line:90%
with the law.

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.022 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Nonjudgmental awareness,
even when the mind wanders,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:90%
that's just what the mind does.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to come
back to the breath,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to connect and sustain awareness
with the present moment.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's like
this, sitting, breathing.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever sensations are
present in your body,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
meeting them with kind,
accepting awareness.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So the police were after me.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:10%
I'd been stealing.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:10%
I was in a pseudo
kind of bike gang.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:10%
And that was the sort of
second turning point for me,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:10%
where I just realized
that the only thing that's

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:10%
given me any sense of
satisfaction, any real hope

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:10%
has been meditation.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:10%
And I haven't been
really applying

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:10%
myself to the meditation.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.924 align:middle line:10%
And I have the relationship.

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And I have the girlfriend.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And I have the
prestige, and the ego

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:10%
trip of my adolescent
rebellion, but I'm miserable.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.545 align:middle line:90%
I'm anxious.

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I really
committed in a more serious way

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:90%
to Buddhist meditation practice.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, kind of reaching out
to my father, Stephen Levine,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
who's a wonderful
teacher and is kind

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of my first teacher and I said,
you know, where do I go next?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I know meditation is
where I need to go.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
How do I take it
to the next level?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And he directed me into a
residential meditation retreat

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
with Jack Cornfield, who has
become one of my core teachers

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went and attended
this meditation retreat.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I had a
mixed experience.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult. And I looked
at all of the differences.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's all hippies.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's all my
parents' generation.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's no tattooed
punks in the room.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But the teaching, the Dharma,
the way that they were speaking

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the truth about the
unsatisfactory nature of life

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
in the material
world, and how there

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
was the spiritual mindful
compassionate solution,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
it just resonated in my heart.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this was
the path for me,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
even though these were
not the people for me.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
These were not--
it wasn't my tribe,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
but the truth just
resonated so deeply.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And my life unfolded from there.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed involved
in the punk scene.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
I sort of came out

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and said, yes, I'm meditating.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm exploring, you
know, yoga, and Hinduism,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and Buddhism, and Sufism.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm exploring
this spiritual,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
because it's giving me relief.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And some of my friends started
saying like, hey, Noah's less

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
of a jerk than he used to be.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something here,
some my recovery friends.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Recovery in the 12-step
program tells us to meditate,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't really
tell us how to meditate.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So now a lot of my
recovery friends

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
are like, OK, let's check out
this Buddhist meditation stuff

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And Dharma Punks became
sort of our own label

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
for kind of inspired
by Jack Kerouac,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and The Beets, and those
early American rebel

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:90%
spiritual rebellion.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But for us, we were kind of
Gen-X, punk rock generation,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
at least our subculture.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was so
inspired by Kerouac,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that I just started calling
my crew the Dharma Punks.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
started teaching.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I actually ended up going
back into that same juvenile

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
hall where I had
been incarcerated

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and learned meditation.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started going back in
and teaching the kids in there

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
how to be mindful and
how to do meditation

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and started a
nonprofit that went

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
into the institution called the
Mind Body Awareness Project.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years into my practice,
my teacher Jack Cornfield said,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I want you to teach and come
work at Spirit Rock with us.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And so as I started teaching
Buddhism, I taught like that.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, like, this
was my suffering.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how the Dharma
Buddhist teachings

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:90%
have transformed my life.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is what my
life is like now.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I got such a good response
from people of hearing

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that, that that's when I
decided to write the first book,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
to write Dharma Punks and
to put it down and say,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I know some people will
resonate with this.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted it to be
available on a broader scale.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Dharma Punks
started to really grow

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
into a kind of
anarchist collective,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%
if there is such a thing.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I think technically anarchists
can't be in collectives,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
but it was a kind of do it
yourself Buddhist movement that

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
happened, where
people are starting

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Dharma Punks groups
over, all of the country,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.001 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:21.438 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Friendly intention.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Watch the thoughts arise
and pass like the bubbles

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.385 align:middle line:90%
in an open space.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
There are plans.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Just name it,
planning, planning.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
There are memories,
fantasies, judgments.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
That's just what the mind does.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Have a kind of
relationship to this mind.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault. It
should be clear to you

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:90%
that you're not in control.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:90%
The mind has a mind of its own.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So I have several-- I've been
so inspired and so connected

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to several different teachers
and several different lineages

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
My main teacher
is Jack Kornfield,

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:84%
who came out of the
Thai forest tradition,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and then also his teaching
partner for many years,

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Goldstein,
who was inspired

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
a bit more by the
Burmese school and came

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
out of the Mahasi Sayadaw
lineage of Burmese Buddhism.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So those two guys are kind
of the patriarchs in American

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, in my
mind, and have been

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:90%
my teachers for many years.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Also Sharon Salzberg, who
was the original-- that

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
was the three of
them that really

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
set up kind of
insight meditation

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:10%
So those three-- sounds
a little bit more

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:10%
like a law firm then
Buddhism-- Goldstein, Salzburg,

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:10%
and Cornfield,
they've been really

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:10%
dear to my heart and dear
guides and teachers to me.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And then Ajahn Amaro is a
Buddhist monk in the Thai

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:84%
forest tradition who I met very
early in my practice over 20,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
probably almost
25 years ago now,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and he's been a
guide and a mentor

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
from the monastic
side of Buddhism

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that has really guided me and
inspired me over the years.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I am primarily inspired
by Theravada Buddhism.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's Buddhism as currently
practiced in Sri Lanka, Burma,

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Thailand, Southeast Asia.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Theravada Buddhism comes
from the "Pali Canon"

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and the original, the
earliest recorded teachings

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
of Buddhism of the Buddha.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit of
a fundamentalist, where

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
what I want to know is
what did the Buddha teach,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and how can I apply
that to my life?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not so interested
in religion and the way

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
that religion changes
original teachings.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That having been said being
primarily rooted in what would

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
be called Thervada
Buddhism, I'm an American

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
who I go see the Dalai Lama.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I study with Tibetan
teachers, with Zen teachers.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not pretending to
be a Thai Buddhist.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I am a westerner who is
engaging in the teachings

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and experiencing them directly.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, that just as
Buddhism travelled from India

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
all over Asia, it's been
established here in the West

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:84%
for long enough for
us to-- my opinion,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
is to stop practicing
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
stop practicing
Thai Buddhism, stop

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
practicing Japanese Buddhism.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And for us in the West to say,
we actually have the teachings.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to keep
looking to ancient cultures--

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
which have problems in the kind
of religious manifestations--

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and establish a new tradition--
which is Buddhism in the West

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
or American
Buddhism-- rather than

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:84%
pretending like we're Tibetan or
pretending like we're Japanese.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't say anything to
people who aren't interested.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that what
the Buddha taught

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
was an open offering for
those who are seeking.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And those who aren't seeking,
no need to try to convert

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
or to talk people into it.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That spiritual practice,
meditation practice

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:90%
is for those who want it.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And we all want it
for different reasons.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
extreme story of what

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
brought me to a real
bottom, real consequences

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of my actions.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching
for many years.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And the room is
full of people who

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
are there just because
there's dissatisfaction.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:90%
There's stress.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:90%
There's grief.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:90%
There's unattended sorrow.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And they come for whatever
motivation, to seek happiness,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:90%
to seek peace.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's all different
levels of suffering.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
no hierarchy of suffering.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's extreme or it's
light, suffering is suffering.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And meditation and Buddhist
meditation, the way that Buddha

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
talked, was over and over
he'd say, I only teach

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
the truth of
suffering, how we all

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
have some suffering
in our lives,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and I teach the path
to end that suffering.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's
an extreme suffering

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
or it's a less extreme,
if you want to be free,

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:90%
then meditations for you.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy,
then, of course,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.527 align:middle line:84%
you're probably not
going to meditate.

00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But you're probably
also not watching

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.903 align:middle line:90%
this show if you're happy.

00:15:39.903 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha once said, we could
search the entire universe

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:55.061 align:middle line:84%
and never find anyone more
worthy of our love and kindness

00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:90%
then ourselves.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to start from the inside
in order to genuinely love.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:90%
We must learn to love ourselves.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:90%
May I be at ease.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be at ease.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
May I be free from suffering.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
May all beings be
free from suffering.
