00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, I'm Noah Levine.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Buddhist
meditation teacher.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And the following is a
20-minute guided meditation

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:84%
on kind awareness,
bringing together

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the principles of
mindfulness-- present time

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
awareness-- and a kind
response to what we

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:90%
experience in the mindfulness.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Please begin by finding a way
to sit that is upright, stable--

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
you can be sitting in a
chair, on a cushion, whenever

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:90%
feels right to you.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allowing your eyes to close.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Bringing full attention
into your body.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.296 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing any tension that your
body may be holding, softening,

00:00:56.296 --> 00:00:56.795 align:middle line:90%
releasing.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the breath to
come and go naturally.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Let the body breathe
all by itself.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And for the first few minutes
concentrate your attention

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
on the breath.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in, feel the breath.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Breathing out,
receive the sensations

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that the breath creates at
the nostrils or in the belly.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You may find it helpful to count
the breath, starting on the out

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
breath, breathing out
one, breathing in two,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
breathing out three, breathing
in four, breathing out five,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and then back down.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in four, breathing
out three, breathing in two,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:90%
breathing out one.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Finding your own
rhythm with the breath

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and counting it up
and down to five.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And if your attention is
drawn away from the breath,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
you can name-- put a
mental label-- on what

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
is taking your attention away.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Is it a sound?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Or a thought?

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:10%
Just name it hearing, thinking.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And then gently return your
attention to the breath.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to stop
your mind from thinking.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Just allowing those thoughts
to be in the background,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
not indulging, not paying
attention to the mind,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
choosing to pay attention to
your body and the sensations

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:90%
that the breath creates.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Come back to the
counting, over and over,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:90%
as many times as you need to.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Each breath has a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Pay close attention--
bring interest, curiosity.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
How does the breath
enter the nostrils?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
How does it exit?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the rising and
falling of the abdomen

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with each breath, the expanding
and contracting of the lungs.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
What is the texture or
temperature that you're

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:90%
aware of with the breath?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Concentrating the attention.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.343 align:middle line:84%
Returning as often as you
need to, with kindness,

00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:34.093 align:middle line:90%
with friendliness.

00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Nonjudgmental
awareness, even when

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
the mind wanders-- that's
just what the mind does.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to come
back to the breath,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to connect and sustain awareness
what the present moment.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Right now it's like this,
sitting, breathing, whatever

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
sensations are present in your
body, meeting them with kind,

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.173 align:middle line:90%
accepting awareness.

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is
happening in your mind,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
meeting it with kind,
accepting awareness.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We're continuing to have
the breath as the chosen

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
object of awareness.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
stop everything else.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything else in the
background, breath and body

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.575 align:middle line:84%
the foreground of
your attention.

00:06:43.575 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
You can now begin to expand
your attention beyond the breath

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to include the other
sensations in your body.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Opening to all of
the sense stores--

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.905 align:middle line:84%
here in the present
moment there are sounds.

00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.805 align:middle line:84%
Listening meditation,
receiving the sounds.

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
There are smells and tastes.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Emotions in the body and mind.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.275 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts arising and passing.

00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Expanding this kind awareness
to your whole being.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:10%
Present time, nonjudgmental
awareness of what is right now.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.645 align:middle line:90%
It's like this.

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's an ache,
maybe there's some pleasure.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
Without trying to create
any special experience,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
just being with
your experience as

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
it is in this moment with
nonjudgmental awareness,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:90%
with kind awareness.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
As you pay closer
and closer attention

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
you begin to understand
the impermanent nature, how

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
every sensation that arises
is in a process of change.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Each breath comes and
goes, each sensation

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
arises and passes, each emotion
arises, is felt in the body,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
is known by the mind,
but is in motion,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
is passing through awareness.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You can turn your
attention on your mind,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
watch your mind,
no longer ignoring,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
but with this kind attitude,
friendly intention.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Watch the thoughts
arise and pass

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.975 align:middle line:90%
like bubbles in an open space.

00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
There are plans-- just name
it, planning, planning.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:10%
There are memories,
fantasies, judgments.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
That's just what the mind does.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Have a kind relationship
to this mind.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault. It
should be clear to you

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're not in control.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:90%
The mind has a mind of its own.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
As we sit in meditation
the mind continues

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.225 align:middle line:90%
to think all by itself.

00:10:56.225 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness of the mind,
mindfulness of the body.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
As well is beginning
to understand

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
the impermanent and impersonal
nature of what's happening.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.605 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to try you
discern how it feels.

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:90%
How does the breath feel?

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.105 align:middle line:84%
Is it pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral?

00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
How does your body feel?

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Are their places
of unpleasantness

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:10%
from sitting still?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:10%
Rather than moving to
avoid that unpleasantness,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.137 align:middle line:10%
bring your attention right
into the places of pain,

00:12:04.137 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:10%
of discomfort.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:10%
What are the sensations
that make up this pain?

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Is there tingling, pressure?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it hot or cold?

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Where's the edges?

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Where's the center?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:10%
Pain is also an
impermanent phenomena.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Name it unpleasant and be
aware of the habitual reactive

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
tendency of wanting to escape
from pain, the survival

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:02.645 align:middle line:84%
instinct, aversion, I don't like
this, I want to be comfortable.

00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Pain arises and passes.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our practice to
learn tolerance and ultimately

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:90%
compassion.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.735 align:middle line:84%
May I be at ease
even with this pain?

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
May I develop a friendly
relationship, a kind response

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to the pains in my life?

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Now try to identify a place
it's in your experience that

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
is pleasant-- a pleasant
emotion or thought,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a pleasant
sensation in the body.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
How about the contact point of
your hands resting in your lap?

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:90%
The warmth, the touch.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Identify a pleasant experience
and bring your attention

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:90%
to that pleasantness.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Where's the center?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.922 align:middle line:90%
Where are the edges?

00:14:31.922 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Where does it become neutral?

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Also bringing awareness to
the habitual reactive tendency

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:55.025 align:middle line:84%
to cling to pleasure, to get
attached, to craved for more.

00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The kind of response
is to let go.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.295 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the clinging.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the craving.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And begin to meet your
pleasant experiences

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.855 align:middle line:90%
with non-attached appreciation.

00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Right now it's like this.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Impermanent pleasure
arising and passing.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
When we cling, we
create suffering.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
When we let go, we have peace,
we have ease and contentment,

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.995 align:middle line:84%
and we can enjoy the
passing pleasures.

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Kind awareness
towards the pleasant.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.615 align:middle line:84%
Kind awareness towards
the unpleasant.

00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.145 align:middle line:84%
Kind awareness
towards the neutral.

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts continue
to arise and pass.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Emotions and sensations.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Sounds, smells,
tastes and seeing.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
That's all that's happening
here-- just thoughts

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.983 align:middle line:90%
and emotions, just sensations.

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to cling to.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that you
need to suffer about.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Let go of whatever
you're holding

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
onto from the past, whenever
you're afraid of in the future.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And rest at ease in the present
with tolerance and compassion

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
towards the unpleasantness,
with great appreciation

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.205 align:middle line:90%
towards the joy that may arise.

00:17:07.205 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
My teacher's teacher
said perhaps meditation

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.779 align:middle line:90%
is as simple as letting go.

00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.234 align:middle line:84%
If you let go a
little bit, he said,

00:17:31.234 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
you will have a little
bit of happiness.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If you let go a
lot you will have

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of peace, happiness, a
lot of ease and well-being.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you let go absolutely,
relinquishing clinging,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
developing compassion,
then you'll

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:84%
know the happiness and
freedom of the Buddha.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to say that
your mind will become quiet

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and still like a
still forest pool.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of strange
and wonderful animals

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
will come to drink
from that pool.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Now these strange and wonderful
animals are your thoughts,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
are your emotions,
are your sensations.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And the stillness
is the awareness

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that holds it all, unperturbed,
un-agitated by emotion,

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:90%
by thought, by sensation.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Kind awareness brings
us to the freedom

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:03.975 align:middle line:84%
that we seek, the happiness
we took birth to find.

00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Staying in this experience
of mindfulness for as long as

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:90%
you'd like.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere to go, nothing
to do, no one to be.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Just the breath,
just the present.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready you
can allow your eyes to open,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
you can allow your
body to move, and you

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
can bring your attention back
into the space that you're in.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.147 align:middle line:90%
