00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm Noah Levine, Buddhist
meditation teacher,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and the following
is an introduction

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:90%
to mindfulness meditation.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Please begin by
finding a way to sit

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:90%
that is upright but relaxed.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to cross your
legs or sit on the ground.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a chair and
comfortable there, on a couch,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:90%
wherever you feel at ease.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You can be in front of your
computer sitting in your chair.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:10%
If you're in a chair, have
your feet flat on the ground.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
If you are going to
sit on a cushion,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
then try to get up high enough
so that your legs are flat

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're creating some
support for your body

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.039 align:middle line:90%
by your crossed legs.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Taking that posture,
and when you're ready,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
allowing your eyes to close.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And relaxing into your body.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.243 align:middle line:84%
Releasing any
unnecessary tension.

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Softening your eyes, your face.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.845 align:middle line:90%
Releasing the jaw and shoulders.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.775 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of any
tension in your stomach.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Finding the place in your body
where you feel the breath.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:10%
The Buddha's instructions
for mindfulness meditation

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:10%
began with breathing
in, know that you're

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:10%
breathing in, breathing out,
know that you're breathing out.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the breath as it enters
and exits through the nostrils.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Letting everything else
be in the background.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to stop
your mind from thinking,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but stop paying attention
to the thinking mind

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and choose rather
to pay attention

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
to the breathing body.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.165 align:middle line:84%
Feel the breath as it
enters and as it exits.

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You may find it helpful to
note in as you breathe in

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and note out as you exhale.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Just a quiet, mental label
keeping most of the attention

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
on the direct experience
of the breath,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
receiving the sensations, and
just a light, mental note.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:90%
In, out.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
When your attention
wanders into thinking,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself involved in
a story, in a memory, a plan.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Simply note that.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Name it.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Thinking, and then come
right back to the breath.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in, breathing out.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Continue in this way for as
long as feels sustainable.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You can stop at five minutes or
you can continue continuously

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
bringing your attention back
to the breath over and over.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Establishing
awareness of the body,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
future and the past.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Mindfulness of the present.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:10%
If you notice your
body becoming tense,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:10%
you can relax, soften, release,
letting go of any tension that

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:10%
comes into the body.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And doing your best to sustain
attention with the breath,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:84%
but when the attention
wanders, simply

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:90%
returning without judgment.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Just forgiving ourselves
and starting over,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
feeling the breath come and go,
in the body, in the present.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
ready, allow your eyes

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
to open, bringing awareness
back into the room,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
feeling your body
and allowing yourself

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to move, to stretch, to do
whatever feels good to do.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.222 align:middle line:90%
