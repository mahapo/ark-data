00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.535 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we're going to travel
to another region in Indonesia.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Bali.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And meet one of the kings
of the regions there.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Now he is an energy master.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And the way they've
developed their energy,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:84%
their power within,
is by doing something

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're all told not to do.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Play with fire.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
When you activate your
energy, you use fire.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Fire is the life force energy.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.402 align:middle line:84%
It's the captured sunlight that
we all have within ourselves.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You offer your body into
the pit, into the flame.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And it purifies and it burns
the different-- some scars,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
breaches of your scar
minds, and so on.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
that emergs has purified

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.592 align:middle line:90%
by fire, the physical element.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It's also a practice that they
call the Pancha Maha-Bhoota,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:90%
the great five elements.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Then as power and control
over that element.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this specific
tradition, they somehow

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:90%
mastered that element.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the king, who is not
a yoga hermit in the cave,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:84%
so he didn't have his life
to practice that full time.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:90%
He's an official.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So he had to live
the kind of life

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:90%
that they are expected to live.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And he cultivates these
with what is called,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
they have this practice
of these five fires.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You use the fire element
to stimulate and trigger

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
certain reactions in your body,
in your energies, in your mind

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
by doing this rituals.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And the rituals are quite
dramatic because you really

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:90%
have to touch the fire.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It would be like
fire walking, right?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
that if you know

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
how to do it, just like fire
walking, you don't get burned.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.203 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
that it's energy.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
You can think that it's
spirit protecting you.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
You can think it's
just simple physics.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the case, you don't
really get burned or hurt.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.897 align:middle line:84%
But undoubtedly,
you are able to,

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
because of the shock
that you have out of it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent, you are
able to enter or to cross

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
through a different state of
awareness, a different state

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.995 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is really
the point, right?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Is it's not necessarily
to overcome fire.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's really to, as
you say, wake up your mind

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
or to have some realization.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Of course, of course.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.048 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that specific
training then

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
it's part of what they
call the famous Kundalini.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
The Kundali training.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the pit of
the fire that you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
have to plunge the burning
sticks or the fires,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of standing in the pit of
the snake in the kunda,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
in the well.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So that the snake
sort of comes up.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is a whole ritual that
is both external, allegorical,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and of course, it corresponds
with very specific practices.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now fire helps us to ignite
our superhuman abilities.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It helps to activate powerful
energy within ourselves.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So watch this scene as David
and the king play with fire.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:28.912 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> During all my years of
research and comparison

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
of these practices, I met
a great master who refused

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
to teach me because he only
taught the royal families.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So I tracked down the last
king whom he taught to.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I found him.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.826 align:middle line:84%
And I basically begged
him to teach me.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
The king has agreed to
teach you a secret practice

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:90%
of the royal family.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice aimed at
awakening what in the east

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:90%
they call the Kundalini.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The Kundalini literally
means the coiled one.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's often represented
by a snake, coiled snake.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And the aim of the
practice is to rise it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:90%
through the central channel.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal
symbol, which we

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
find in many medical
association logos,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
such as the American Medical
Association and the World

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Health Organization.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
This Kundalini is
the key to vitality.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It is a gate to the infinite.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And with this practice,
we are going to wake it.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:90%
How do you wake up a snake?

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.164 align:middle line:84%
Well, you throw
fire into the pit.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:04:52.650 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
To wake up the Kundalini and
the latent power of the snake

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
inside, the king has
to swallow the fire

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:90%
into the pit of his belly.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm going to do it too.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Together?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.555 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's red hot.

00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:90%
My belly is on fire.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.725 align:middle line:84%
Requires concentration
and a very firm mind.

00:07:52.725 --> 00:08:01.674 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
To fan this fire, just like the
fan is fanning the charcoals.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:09:21.497 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wasn't that incredible?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Now this master has been
trained for many years

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:84%
to work with the fire to
ignite internal energy.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
People have walked on coals.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
You might have seen that in
the beginning of the scene

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
where they're doing a ritual
called the Kecak dance.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
way of working

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
with fire to activate energy,
to push beyond our limits.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Fire has a way of burning
away the unnecessary,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the old energy, to make
room for new energy

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and that inner light.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Life force energy is mysterious.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the spark behind
your heartbeat.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the light in your mind.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the current of
energy that moves

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:90%
through your nervous system.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We need this energy
to move through us,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to do all the things
that we need to do.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The Balinese master,
he has trained

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
himself to work with
fire, to be able to hold

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous amount of energy.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And this ritual has been used
for thousands of years as a way

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to burn off old energy
to cleanse themselves

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
of old patterns.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.552 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to
show you something you

00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:90%
can do to ignite your energy.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Think about a small fire
that's burning down.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:90%
What do you do to it?

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:90%
You blow on it.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And the fire starts to
activate, gets ignited,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:90%
gets stronger and stronger.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So to ignite your
energy, your inner fire,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.212 align:middle line:90%
we do a breathing practice.

00:10:40.212 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to show
you this right now.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do a
fanning the fire practice.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
quicker breathing.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.958 align:middle line:90%
You're going to-- like that.

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to pump the
energy through your body

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:90%
quickly for about 30 seconds.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
At the end, we're going
to hold our breath.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I then want you to go into a
still space within yourself

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and feel the electricity, the
life force energy circulating

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
After we hold the breath
for a few seconds,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:84%
we're going to inhale
through the nose

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and exhale through the
nose slowly, and let

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
this warm radiant,
energy circulate

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:90%
through our whole body.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to try it?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
You can put your hands
over your lower abdomen

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and breathe with me.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to--
when you exhale,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:84%
your belly goes back
toward your spine.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Do it strongly.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Fan that fire.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Two more times.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, and hold your breath.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And go into a stillness
within yourself.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy and
the electricity.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.435 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath.

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Now inhale through your nose.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the nose.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Go into real slow breathing.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Feel the warmth, the
radiance, the inner light

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:90%
sparked within yourself.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Breath is energy.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Fire or light is energy.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
energy within us.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Energy is this mystical force
that keeps your heart beating.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the light in your mind.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the current in
your nervous system.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
mystical about yourself.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this breathing
exercise and ignite inner fire,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you're working with the mystical
force energy within you.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.045 align:middle line:90%
Hope you enjoyed that.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are you?

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people when asked this
seemingly simple question

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
go blank, just as
you did probably.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It is one of life's greatest
mysteries even science cannot

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.877 align:middle line:90%
answer.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Science has come a long way.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many mysteries
about the nature of reality

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.425 align:middle line:84%
that still science
doesn't answer.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.415 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.415 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Trying to find your mind
inside your body is like trying

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to find the internet
in your computer.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You won't find it
because the internet

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
isn't in your computer.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.055 align:middle line:84%
Your computer is
in the internet.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You close your
eyes, you see images.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:90%
You hear sounds.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's no light
source in your brain

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
or an audio source in your
brain to project those sounds

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and images.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is mysterious.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
In this next
episode, we are going

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to see superhumans
who have mastered

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:90%
the power of their minds.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And what you witness
might seem unbelievable.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
you to a research lab

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
where David takes Ariel, a
psychokinetic from Argentina,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
where they're studying how
this phenomena happens.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.155 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to see Ariel
move objects with his mind?

00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> What's different about him?

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> He's the only psychokinetic
subject I studied who can

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
produce phenomena under
good scientific conditions.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What sort of
psychokinetic is he?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe we can figure that out.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no idea
how you would even

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
know for certain
which explanation

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:90%
is the appropriate one.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a couple of ideas.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm probably going to bring him
to see a league of other people

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.864 align:middle line:10%
with exceptional abilities.

00:14:51.864 --> 00:15:09.628 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:09.628 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> David has assembled some of
the greatest masters that he

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
knows to help guide Ariel into
discovering what his gifts are

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:90%
all about.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They come from all
over the world.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are some amazing,
amazing people that

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:90%
have mind bending abilities.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And what they're going to teach
us is how to quiet the mind.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And when the mind is
quiet, we have access

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to new potentials and
new possibilities.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Although you come from
different continents,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
different cultures, I invited
you all here tonight in this

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
private meeting because you
have something in common.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
All of you have found
ways, different ways

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:90%
to access the infinite.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:90%
The infinite field.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
This enables each one
of you, differently,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%
to do exceptional things.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The things you do are very often
considered stuff of legend.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are things that excite
people, but also frighten them

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a time.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
people that do not

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
want the knowledge
that you have accessed

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to be of public dominion.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Sergey from Russia,
who uses awareness

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to control space and time
in extreme situations.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Ariel from Argentina.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.402 align:middle line:84%
A telekinetic with
a very rare gift.

00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
reasons why we're here,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand and explain
this gift and the implications

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Marina, a Russian superwoman
with x-ray vision.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
We are all here to answer
one primary question.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
What are the methods that you
have developed, experimented

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
with, researched with, that you
deem most effective to assess

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:90%
the infinite?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.677 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.677 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Through David's
travels around the world,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:90%
he's met some great masters.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little journey
into self-discovery.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's discover the
powers of our own minds.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:90%
David mentions the infinite.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
The infinite is always
present within the finite.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You are a localized mind
of an infinite mind.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You want to feel the infinite
mind, the spaciousness that we

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:90%
all have.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Take a minute, and we're going
to do a little exercise right

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there's always
spaciousness within your mind.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that they
talk about is quieting the mind.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Finding the silence in the mind.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
challenging concept

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
if we don't know
how to do it right.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is there is
always silence in the mind.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
We just need to learn how
to pay attention to it.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
If you notice around
the room, there's

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:90%
always space between objects.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
There's this thing
and this thing,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the space between.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Space between floor and ceiling.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to that
just for a moment.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And then close your eyes.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way there's
space between your thoughts,

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts are
like the objects.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you pay
attention to the space,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you can start to feel the
infinite within your own mind.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Take a slow, deep breath.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And even bring some
space to the breath,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
so that when you inhale,
there's a little pause.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you exhale, at
the bottom of your exhale,

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:90%
there's a little pause.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Now at those moments where
your breath is still,

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
let your mind be still as well.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Feel the spaciousness
in your own mind.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
spaciousness that the field

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
of pure potential of
infinite possibilities

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%
are made available to us.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Notice the stillness
within your mind.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Just pay attention to it.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Up next is Marina.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Marina is a superwoman
that can see

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
with her eyes closed, by looking
through the lens of her mind.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Marina is unbelievable.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Marina will now attempt
to do something unique.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
She will access a
very specific state

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.605 align:middle line:84%
and enter into
the field of mind.

00:20:03.605 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a star.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Three waves.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:20:18.448 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You have this
complicated shape.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
say it in English.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I see 1, 2, 3, 4 5,
6 angles and lines.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Hexagon.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Same in English.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Hexagon.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to put on,
Marina, one more layer.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
A thick, black layer,
just to make sure

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that what is happening
is happening in her mind.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:90%
She's not using her eyes to see.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, Marina, I'm going to
put this blindfold on.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Marina, will you also be
able to tell me colors?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's try.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's try.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a star,
and it's yellow.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.965 align:middle line:84%
Not just see, but you
also distinguish colors.

00:21:21.965 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a square, orange.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Marina, you want to
try with the book.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll go get it.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Perform I think.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Perform the following to protect
the vehicle and liberally,

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.607 align:middle line:84%
literally or liberally,
l-i-b-e-r-a-l-l-y.

00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It's unbelievable that
she's reading a book.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, David, let's
finish please.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Finish, finish.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not an interesting book.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a very
interesting book.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.465 align:middle line:90%
It's a car manual.

00:22:24.465 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If I understand correctly,
what I'm doing in order

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to start to see
with closed eyes.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it's needed
to do two steps.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's needed to
stop thinking about anything.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
That is first step,
is mind silence.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And only when you
feel mind silence,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
you need to start to focus on
the object you want to know,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
you want to see.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And very important is to
find the correct place

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
where the card, the
shape or object is now.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you made
your mind empty,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
but you're looking in
the wrong direction,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.625 align:middle line:84%
you can see nothing
or some mistakes.

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine a world where these
tools and techniques are taught

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to our children.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
They move through life with
curiosity and joy and wisdom.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Kids have a lot to
teach us innately.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:84%
They are full of
joy and playfulness.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
When I ask my kids,
what did you do today?

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
They always answer, play.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And Sergey said,
when we play, when

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
we see the world with
childlike wonder,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:84%
we get access to our power
and innate abilities.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
We start to get constricted
when we think we know the world.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Knowing constricts our energy
to play, to open our hearts,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
to see life with
the beginner's mind.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Nikolai
and Marina do so beautifully

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
well, is teach children how to
tap in to their innate powers

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.130 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Nikolai and Marina are
working with these kids

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
because children
have zero resistance.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So their image of the world,
their system of belief

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:90%
is not fixed yet.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So it can easily be not
just changed, but expanded.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So Nikolai and Marina
are capable of teaching

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
normal kids and
even blind children

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to learn to see the
world through their mind,

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:90%
through the senses of the mind.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they call them six
senses or the spiritual eyes.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a learning process,
where they train children

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to learn to see their body,
recognizing through touch,

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:84%
so feeling sensations, and
then gradually expanding these

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
to all the other
palettes of the senses.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.035 align:middle line:90%
This is now the first day.

00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We will experiment
for a few more days.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The results generally
are quite interesting.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it interesting?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, you will do
very complicated exercise.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Very, very, very, very
important exercise.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Very important exercise.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:90%
You and you close your eyes.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
You try to touch the nose.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Close eyes.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't touch her mouth.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:90%
If mistake--

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Bite you.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.875 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:55.675 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so nice.

00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't open your eyes.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't open.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.904 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.904 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Funny.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Laugh and laugh.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Easy?

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So easy?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Kids are great, right?

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Their minds are so
open, so curious.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the key things to
becoming superhuman and tapping

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
into our infinite
potential within

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.478 align:middle line:84%
is a flexible,
non-resistant mind.

00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to take you
through an exercise that

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
will help you to become
flexible in your mind.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that we're
going to do is quiet the mind.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
mind is quiet, we're

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to move
the mind to different areas.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Take a few slow, deep breaths.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Feel the stillness of your
mind by pausing slightly

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
at the top of your
inhale and slightly

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of your exhale.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And when your mind
starts to become still,

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move your
mind to the ceiling

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and look down on
yourself meditating

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So just put your point of
attention above your head,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and look down on yourself.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Notice the objects of the room.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.625 align:middle line:84%
See if you can see
with your eyes closed.

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:84%
This takes
concentration and focus.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
When your mind pops back
into your localized attention

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
within yourself, project
it up onto the ceiling,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and look into the room.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:90%
See yourself from above.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Could you do it?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:90%
That takes practice.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Practice it often.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You can move yourself
just above you.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
You can move it to
the side, upper right

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:90%
corner, upper left corner.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Practice moving
your mind and then

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:90%
focusing on what you can see.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You can start to get a
sense of what's in the room

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and where you are.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:84%
In the next journey, we're going
to find some martial artists

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that are not only good
at physical exercises,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but they do something
truly incredible.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They start to move their
opponents with their minds.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
