as the swastika,

another name and is

the sign of the thunder,
the thunder mark.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Sifu.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm spending the day
here with the master,

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:90%
and again, he's diagnosing.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what he does
almost every patient.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Takes their pulse.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.163 align:middle line:90%
Listens to their energy.

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
When you listen
to the energy, you

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
get to see their
progress as well,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
so patients will come every day
over a period of a week or two

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
weeks and see how the
shift in energy happens.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the energy shifts,
there's an unblocking.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:90%
The pulse changes.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
The energy sensation
in your body changes.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
blocked often, it'll

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.683 align:middle line:90%
feel like it bounces back.

00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The energy doesn't
go through your body.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It bounces back, but
then this magical thing

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
happens where the energy passes
freely through your system.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strong
current, and it ends up

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
going all the way
down to your feet.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, he is taking her
pulse, and pulse diagnosis

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:90%
takes a long time to perfect.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And with a skill of qi and
understanding of this energy

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
system in the body,
you can listen to it,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you a
lot of information.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the West, we don't have
a word for the energy system.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The qi in the body
and the energy system

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:90%
is like any other system.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It's something that provides us
with our life, our lifeforce.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's really the spark
behind the heart.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the light in your mind.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling
of your emotions.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So qi is what gives
power to everything,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and with his energy,
he'll power up your system

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:90%
so that you feel more alive.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm bringing my patients in.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing my
friends in, my family

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in to have this rare
opportunity to see him.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very excited to get
my treatment right now.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
The master right now
is taking my pulse.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
This is part of traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
but unlike traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
we have a master that
practices the old medicine.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a very different
style of medicine.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, Chinese medicine
was called the art

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.678 align:middle line:84%
of preventing disease
and prolonging life,

00:09:52.678 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
prolonging life
meaning they're going

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to prevent problems from
arising in the first place.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So as he listens
to the pulse, he'll

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.172 align:middle line:84%
notice imbalances or
blockages in your body

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even
know are there.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I've been practicing
qigong for 28 years,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very familiar with
energy and energy medicine.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But I've never experienced
anything like this,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
so I'll try to explain
exactly what I'm

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
feeling as he's doing it.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in China that
this medicine was practiced

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
more regularly, but after
the Cultural Revolution,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
medicine shifted and changed.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in the
presence of somebody

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
who's a gatekeeper of very
ancient wisdom and very

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
ancient understanding of
how the mind body energy

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:90%
system actually works.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> How is he receptive
to your energy?

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> He says I'm good.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I practice a lot,
and I've practiced

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of techniques of qigong
exercises and practices

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and meditations that
he's recommended for me.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I
first walked in, he

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
said that I looked younger
this year than I did last year,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:90%
so I got that going for me.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, he's going to
hold my hand, and--

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually--

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, very strong current.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at my hand, total
involuntary movement in my arm.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel it going all the
way out through my foot.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.985 align:middle line:84%
All my muscles on this
left side of my body

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
are completely contracted.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It unblocks the channels.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.562 align:middle line:90%
So powerful.

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going down through my
arm, through the left side

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.375 align:middle line:90%
He's modulating the current.

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel this hot, electrical
energy in the chest

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and a very strong
current in the abdomen.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Important to breathe
through it because it

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.955 align:middle line:84%
goes through the body
down to the feet.

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:06.102 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.102 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That was a flash of bright
white light at this point, which

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
is a very special treatment.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
When he hits this point, it
opens this mid eye center,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.002 align:middle line:90%
and it just is strong.

00:12:18.002 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You feel your teeth
and your tongue

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and a flash of light
in your forehead.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
What a treat.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:84%
What a special,
special treat that was.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
His healing power is
so profound in terms

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of its physical sensations.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you feel
his electricity,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and you're like how does
this come out of one human

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:90%
being's body?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just so
powerful, especially

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.920 align:middle line:90%
in his diagnostic skills.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So he's going, here's
the potential for danger

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
later in your life because
your qi is depleted

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.522 align:middle line:90%
in your kidneys or your heart.

00:12:49.522 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This could cause these
kinds of problems.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's fix it now
before it ever arises.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is just
amazing kind of medicine.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, really, really healing
because, and this is a little

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
personal, but I had
just had a miscarriage.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's very common.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Many women go through that.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You lose a lot of blood, and the
blood and the qi are connected.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So you become very
weak and tired a lot.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So I went to see the master
specifically for this,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't tell him anything.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
He just looks at the
tongue, takes the pulse,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately, he
was like kidneys, deficient.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so he really
worked on my kidneys,

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and after I saw him
about five times--

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my mind was blown.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of the electricity
that runs through the body,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and then afterwards,
I sat and meditated.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
move for two hours,

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and just felt my kidneys
pulsing with warmth.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.797 align:middle line:84%
And I just smiled at
the kidneys and knew

00:13:44.797 --> 00:13:45.755 align:middle line:90%
that they were healing.

00:13:45.755 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> These pathways of energy
are called meridians,

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and these meridians open
up with his treatments.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And each individual has
a unique and profound

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:90%
powerful experience.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to go in.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We'll meet the master.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get our
pulse diagnosed, see

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in your body.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel great.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel good?

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
This guy is in very
good shape, so let's see

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:90%
what the master says.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you're in fantastic
shape, and he reads your pulse,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
and he's like, you have no qi.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:90%
So just be prepared.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He feels something a little
bit different than we all feel,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and he'll notice things in
you that are future oriented.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So Chinese medicine is based
on the idea of prevention,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:84%
so prevent disease
before it arises

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:90%
by reading the energy system.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll just try to be as
open hearted as I can.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just relax, and
you're in good hands.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Adam Kleinberg.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The master is
listening to the pulse,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and this gives us an idea of
what to treat and how to treat.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese medicine,
you're going

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%

too much dampness,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%

going to-- and he'll stand up,

>> Oh.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%

wet towel is because the current

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%

then just breathe.

What just happened?

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was like putting
your hand in a socket,

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
basically electric socket,
and it was moving up through

the arm, maybe a little
bit past the elbow.

And then when he
moved back out, it

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.647 align:middle line:84%
became concentrated down through

00:24:30.932 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
like in the movie, you say
you see this bright light,

the light went on.

looking into the mirror

of the luminosity of

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:84%
such an extraordinary
experience that this mind body

are they godlike?

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.968 align:middle line:90%
How do they get it?

00:24:52.968 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it something they cultivate?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
they're born with?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Let us first go full circle.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So in all the cultures
I've traveled,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I found this recurrent
theme, and so it led me

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to a very precocious
obsession with the mythology

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
of the thunder and
the lightning bolts.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We begin with the
very early Vedic gods.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The King of the
gods of the Vedas

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
was Indra, the god of thunder
and the almighty Zeus,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:90%
ruler of heaven.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:10%
He wields the power of the
lightning bolt. In Buddhist

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:10%
mythology, the king
of the god, Chakra.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:10%
In Chinese mythology, that's
the story of the Monkey

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:10%
King is brought, in the
presence of the Buddha,

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:10%
by the eight thunder gods.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So coming back to
your question, I

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:84%
found people who
embody this power--

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:90%
are they god?

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
No, the ones that I have met
were definitely people like you

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and I, flesh and blood.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But they wield this
power, and although,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
in the different cultures,
it appears sometimes

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to be paradoxically
different, there

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
are always those
underlying common elements.

>> Yeah, tell me.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It reminds me of, in China,
I was staying on a Buddhist

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%
island called Putuoshan, and I
was hinting towards the nuns,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
can you show me some special
monks with special powers

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:90%
or nuns with special powers?

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Is there anybody?

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
yes, there's some.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And once they trusted me,
and they understood that--

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing, why I wanted
to, my intention was good,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:90%
they took me.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind, it's
China, still communist,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and they have the Communist
Buddhism, basically.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist temples
are communist,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and so when you go in, and you
see just how it's being run,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.953 align:middle line:90%
you don't expect these things.

00:26:47.953 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't think of
these things going on

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
behind the hidden doors
because, often, they

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, Buddhism was lost
through the whole Cultural

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Revolution--

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the
high level stuff.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's actually not true.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
There's amazing
practitioners who

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
still have this determination
to reach high levels.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So she took me to a private
temple on the island.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was there
except one caretaker,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and walking up this
little room, and I

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
was able to peek
through a peephole

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and see a monk sitting at a
table, a low Chinese table.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
His beard had grown
out onto the floor,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and his robes were so beautiful,
and he just stood there.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And the energy
that was emanating,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
just pouring out this
room, was like thick soup.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like it was a movie
or something, unbelievable,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and he writes
discourses that are

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
read to the nuns and monks
that get morning service.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And that he's so
psychic, he knows

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:84%
if there's any fights going
on or all the political stuff

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:90%
going on in the temple.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And he will address
these certain issues

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and give little hints and
lectures to the nuns and monks

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:90%
to keep them on track.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%

Seven years.

out there that are really

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
pushing themselves to cultivate
their potential-- yeah,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you have this extreme,
and then you have people

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:90%
working in the real world.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's all there because
you don't know when the Divine

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Grace actually is
going to step in.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Because for myself, mostly,
it's when I'm not having any

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:84%
expectations in my practice
that suddenly energy comes,

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, whoa.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I just leveled up.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, how to sustain that
is another question,

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
but to get those moments
of really high insight,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:90%
it's something from grace.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's something from
complete universe surrender.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we are in
relationship with the universe,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:84%
nature, and something that's
beyond these five senses.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that grace, as
you're talking about,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
we see it a lot in
determined practitioners.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They really practice,
they really practice,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and then something
else meets them.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship that
happens, that is established,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that's beyond, let's say,
our physical relationships,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
but something with the
divine that infuses them

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
with some abilities, vision,
practice, inspiration,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.705 align:middle line:84%
and we all feel that at
some moments in our lives.

00:29:18.705 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, I
think one of those clues

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
is to have determined
practice detached from results

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and allowing things to unfold.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
If we are practicing,
it's working the garden,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, nature takes
that seed, and something

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
miraculous happens
where the roots grow.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:90%
It breaks through the ground.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It grows into the light, and
we just are facilitating.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do that same
with our own inner potential.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
We facilitate these things
to grow, blossom, and bloom,

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, we
don't know what seeds

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:90%
are in here that are growing.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's an exciting process.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:90%
