00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:90%
cultures around the world.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the
powers of the mind.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.885 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to focus on the spiritual path.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
After seeing all these different
cultures and practices,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting lost in
the 1,000 different techniques

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that humanity has devised
to alter the brain,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
alter the consciousness
or expand it,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
communicating with the gods,
developing special abilities,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:90%
what are the common results?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And what are the common elements
of each of these practices?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The thousands of methods
that humanity has devised,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
they all try to
do the same thing.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that we need
to do, we need to disconnect.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
We are locked inside our head.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Constantly interacting
with what we think,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
what we say, what we want,
the past, present, and future.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts, our
feelings, our emotion.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Me, me, me.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So what humanity has devised
is a series of practices

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:90%
to shock you out of the system.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And so you go across the globe--

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Africa, South America, Siberia,
China, India, Indonesia, Nepal,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of the spiritual
journey of the apprentice.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The first initiation,
it's snap out.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The first step of
every progress,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
first, we need to
get out of the cave.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the moment that you
disconnect, first of all,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.105 align:middle line:84%
there is silence,
that famous stillness.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.264 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when there
is the silence,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
there is that recognition
that I am not in anymore.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%
I am out.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
For the first time, I am here.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:90%
The mind goes off.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the moment that
I am present, then

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I more become aware of the
silence and of the stillness.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:90%
So those things are natural.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to master them
and to be able to replicate

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:90%
them, that's a skill.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:10%
So that is a pivotal moment.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:10%
And so there is a whole
series of practices

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:10%
that humanity has developed
to stand the state of silence

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:10%
or to extend the
state of presence.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
After you become present,
after you come out,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
these incredible emotions
start to come through.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So the moments when
an amazing piece of music

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.028 align:middle line:84%
or a sunrise or a sunset really
carries you out of yourself.

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:13.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Touches your heart.

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:14.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Touches your heart.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:90%
And there is an emotion.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
That emotion further
brings you out of yourself.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the next step.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there are a whole
number of practices

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that were aimed to develop
that sustained state

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of emotional expansion.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It feels like all--

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the energies of the
body are coming alive.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:84%
You feel potent,
you feel powerful.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.016 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So when the energy comes alive,
that's then another step.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We are able to enter
in this sustained state

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
of both receptivity
and projection.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We're like a radio that
can tune and we can

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:90%
start to receive information.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You connect to your higher self,
you connect to the knowledge--

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
the mind of God, to
Buddha, whatever is it.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:90%
To the wisdom.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.945 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to
receive those one

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
as verbal information,
thoughts, images.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's then the
whole next step.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And so humanity has devised
thousands of practices

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:90%
to decode this information.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.203 align:middle line:90%
To put them in order.

00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And the visions
that come with it,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and the symbols that you see,
and the sound that you hear.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so from there,
the next point is,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
you need to be able to see
and hear because you can't

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:90%
work with what you don't see.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So the real next step,
in all these practices,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
there is something that
happens so that you

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:90%
start to have a vision.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of vision.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.452 align:middle line:84%
And again, here, there
is a whole another layer

00:05:06.452 --> 00:05:07.535 align:middle line:90%
of practice being created.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:07.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to
finally see yourself,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
because what you
see is all yourself,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you think of not as what's
encased in this body

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
but you as that awareness
within which everything

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.263 align:middle line:84%
appears-- you, I, this
Coliseum, and every other person

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:90%
that might be in here.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say that your
mind revealed itself to you.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's experience
of light and luminosity,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
the vision that it's common
to all spiritual, mystical

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:90%
religious tradition.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The seers, the
visionary, they see.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Now that finally
you have seen, you

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
either/or move toward
the object that you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
see-- your beloved, the
vision of God, all right?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The vision of yourself, of
your enlightened nature,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
a vision of the other world.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You learn to move
towards it or you

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
learn to move that which
appears towards you.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
When you can see and you
become one with what you see.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's the famous
experience of union,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of commune from where the
word religion came from.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Religion is in Latin.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
It means [NON-ENGLISH],,
to reunite,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.567 align:middle line:84%
which is the same as
Sanskrit yoga, to yoke.

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:21.275 align:middle line:84%
That literally means
to yoke, to reunite.

00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's really the
stage, and that's the stage

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical union, is what
they call the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole another
series of practices

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that cultures, that humanity,
has developed there.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And know that it's
developed around that.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
still several steps.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The last step that
I show in the movie

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it's the great transfer
where you have seen

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and now you transfer
yourself there.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we do not really have
the proper word to describe it,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very, very unique
phenomenon, because when

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
you can really do that is the
famous separation of the soul,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
if we so want to
call it, the spirit

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%
from the case of the body.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you can really
transfer yourself,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
this little limited
identity, David, Lee,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
we can take it out of this case,
and it can merge and become

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
one and aware of that greater
identity within which we exist.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I want the world to see the map.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.825 align:middle line:84%
I want every one of you
to see, because after you

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
know what you really
should look for

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and you see the existing
in all this culture,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the map is very clear.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
really are practicing

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
are not necessity the
disparate techniques and belief

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.572 align:middle line:84%
system and religious
cultural baggages.

00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:43.905 align:middle line:90%
We are practicing the principle.

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like what you're
doing too is you're giving

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
people the view from the top of
the mountain to see the whole

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:84%
landscape rather than just
one trail, one specific area.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.596 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual path is different
than most journeys.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
On most journeys,
you pack a bag,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
you gather your belongings.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But along the path
of liberation,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to free our spirits, we're
going to do the opposite.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:90%
We're going to let go.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to release
our baggage so that we

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:90%
can be free and travel lightly.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, David
meets Karma Yogi--

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:10%
an Indian master who helps
David clear past conditioning,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:10%
old trauma, emotional
baggage, karma, if you will.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.739 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people that
really can dissolve into light.

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The apotheosis of
Christianity, the resurrection,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the light body of Mount Tabor,
the [INAUDIBLE] of [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Mountain, the Christian
yogis of Ethiopia,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
the great mystics of Tibet.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We have some legends of
the Taoists doing this.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.475 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one
man that did it.

00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Every person potentially can.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And so and that one is the
famous stage of dissolution.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> After you transferred, you
reunite, and then you dissolve.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And this dissolution
is very real.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am not there, I
have certain experiences.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:90%
So I cannot answer what then.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I need to take for face
value, the knowledge that is

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:90%
passed in the oral tradition.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that one day quantum
mechanics and quantum physics

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
will give us intelligent,
interesting models I do not

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the
principles are universal.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
That we do this other
ritual where I lay down

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:90%
on this slab of stone.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
That is what you need to do
in order to go to the Gate,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:90%
to fly.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:84%
What the hot air balloon
needs in order to fly.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:84%
You need to cut the
weight that hold you down.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And what are these weights?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's what you hold.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It's your sorrows, your
pain, your guilt, your shame,

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:90%
and your anger.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
What really holds you back is
the narrative of your own mind.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The past that you
exist into with as many

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:90%
separated entities.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
This practice that is used
to cut, to dissolve, to let

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
go of all the things
that you are holding to,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
which is nothing but yourself.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
The narrative that you
give so much reality to.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment that you can
let them go, they let you go.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So the ghost of your past lets
you go as you let them go.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And this one is the
quintessential teaching

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Buddha.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.763 align:middle line:84%
Then the soul can
emerge naturally

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
from the shadow of the body.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:90%
We think yoga.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows Savasana--
the Corpse Pose.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, this
pose is the pose

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in which you practice the
abandonment of the body.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So Shiva, in the Hindu
culture lays down, OK?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Shakti-- the
spirit, the feminine you

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%
see that triumphantly above him.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So in the moment that you have
abandoned the identification

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
with the body with the narrative
of identity, then finally,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.553 align:middle line:90%
the mind, the spirit is free.

00:11:10.553 --> 00:11:11.845 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that represents.

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:90%

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We are still using studying
and discovering those core

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
principles, and I completely
let go of all my thoughts

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.525 align:middle line:84%
and chiefly are the very sense
of ownership of this body.

00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:46.615 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we are a body,
we're under this illusion.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.323 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that we're into
the practice they call it,

00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:90%
giving before receiving.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You give up your limited
self that has been in a shape

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
in a form of the body and you
receive your infinite self.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is
free from the back.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Your past, your action.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Learning to stop
myself, my body.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
All your karmic debtor and
creditor, they come back.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Until 300 years ago, our
ancestors were killing people.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's all stored here.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.865 align:middle line:90%
It's all stored here.

00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And in our life, many times,
we are willingly or unwillingly

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
you hurt people.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
You have hurt them.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So they keep a tension, a
negative tension towards you.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:90%
They want something from you.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be able to
give it to them freely.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I say, I give you
what you really want.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.748 align:middle line:90%

>> With Karma, we had a
very interesting story.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We met at the
airport in Thailand.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%
He came out of his retreat.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.315 align:middle line:84%
His guru just passed away
displaying the great miracles

00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
of-- it's called the lesser,
the small rainbow body

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
where the body doesn't
completely dissolve

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:90%
into the light but it shrinks.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And so his master
just passed away,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
he came out of many,
many years of retreat.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And they invited him to some
monastery there in Thailand.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And he loses his
passport, his money,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
so he was stranded
in the airport.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't really see
many lamas around there.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So we sort of stumble
into each other

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's an incredibly
accomplished yogi.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's called the cemetery
sadhana, the cremation ground

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:90%
sadhana.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
He spent nine years
in these practices.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Disconnecting,
cutting all the things

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that keep you inside so that
you can finally come out.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So see, each one of
these people, there

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:90%
is a story behind.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:27.668 align:middle line:90%
There are many stories.

00:15:27.668 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The most important stories to
tell is what they exemplify.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So the culmination
of the movie really,

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Gate, is really about
this dissolution

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of who you identify
with, who you think

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
you are into expanding
into this higher

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:90%
mind as the great superhuman.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Possible.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Every person has
the right to that.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And is also considered a
great insurance to that.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have learned,
if you have opened the highway

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and you know how to go and where
to go, at the moment of that,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.235 align:middle line:90%
you are not afraid.

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're going
into another reality.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you know it.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
You're ready.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.105 align:middle line:90%
And you know how to go.

00:16:04.105 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:90%
You know how to go there.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Because through the
practice, you've been there.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.953 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back
with that experience.

00:16:08.953 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is profoundly
transformative.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're
able to truly let

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.495 align:middle line:84%
go and relax in this
life and enjoy this life.

00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:19.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because you already
died, you already came back.

00:16:19.102 --> 00:16:20.185 align:middle line:90%
Many times, not just once.

00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks for the
explanation because this

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
covers so many topics--

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
from the supernatural,
to the spiritual,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.625 align:middle line:84%
to the powers of the mind,
to healing powers, all in one

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to be
the journey of life.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Journey of a
lifetime, definitely.

00:16:36.832 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Thanks my friend.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Karma cleansing is a way
to let go of the old and come

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
into the present moment,
refreshed and expanded.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:90%
We can do this for ourselves.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
always have a master

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and help us clean our karma.

karma cleansing and letting

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
go of some stress or
tension or tightness?

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.532 align:middle line:84%
In each and every moment, we
can let go of the unnecessary.

00:17:06.532 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I want you to do.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.115 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a deep breath,

00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
hold your hands
just by your face,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
make a heart sound.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:90%
This sound is [VOCALIZING].

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going
to [VOCALIZING]..

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're not doing it
to make it sound pretty,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
but you're doing it
for the vibration

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration then helps
to clear stress, tension,

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
tightness, and harmonize
your energy field.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Think of your body
as an instrument

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that we want tuned up so
that it's harmonious rather

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
than discordant.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take the hands up,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to make a sound.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
As you do this, you just
glide your hands down

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and three or four times,
you're going to feel this aah.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Release of, stress,
tension, and tightness.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.598 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:17:59.598 --> 00:18:00.552 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:18:00.552 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And you want to feel
this nice, warm sensation

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:90%
all the way down your body.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you need
a little clearing,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
releasing of stress, tension,
old emotional energy,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:19.945 align:middle line:90%
you can do that sound.

00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
We're going to explore spirit.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Our true sense of who we are.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at the
map, we've traveled,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
we've looked through the
lens of energy, and mind,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, and
cleansing old energy to arrive

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:90%
into the present moment.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And now, who are
we at our essence?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The Gate is a secret
practice, and it's

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
about opening up and
expanding our consciousness

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
about dislocating our
mind and becoming one

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
with the Buddha mind,
with the grand mind,

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%
with the infinite field.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So David opens this point,
and through this ritual,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
when the point actually
opens, the skull

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.480 align:middle line:84%
opens you could put a plate of
grass right into this point.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
It's quite extraordinary.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But think about how we
come into this world.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:90%
As babies, this point is open.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness and our
spirit, our minds and bodies

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
are fusing together.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older,
the skull closes.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But through Gate, they open
that point back up again

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and they allow the
spirit, the consciousness

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to travel and connect
to the universal wisdom.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Think of this as traveling
to the top of the mountain

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and having a grand
view, a vista,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of seeing what
life is all about.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Then when we come back,
we've got that experience

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of an expanded vision and we
can bring that into daily life.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And what this allows us to do
is to relax a little bit more.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
That we know where we come
from, our true source.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can travel
the rest of the road

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
with lightness and levity,
a liberated spirit.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Since we were sort of
interested in the extreme ends

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:10%
of things.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:10%
Definitely.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you had
experience with people,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:10%
with the grass in the head
and this idea of Gate?

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Again, being based as
I was for over 20 years

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:10%
in the Kathmandu Valley, I went
to meet one of the great Bon

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:10%
masters, this Tenzin Nimya.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
to see him, there

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
was a mother and a
daughter who had just

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
finished to attend the
retreat after having received

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
the initiation into this Phowa
practice, this transference

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I was having my
conversation with this lama,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the women bowed over
and he stuck grass

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:90%
into the tops of their heads.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a straw about this long.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what
was all that about?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So this was just
real confirmation

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that these things are
not just metaphors.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So some of the miracles that
you hear about in the texts

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and which are recounted
in oral tradition,

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot from
David in that through.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He's investigated this not only
in other Buddhist traditions

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
as well, but also
among the Sufis,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
Turkey where, again,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
is opening up as it were
at the central channel

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%
beyond the body.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.208 align:middle line:84%
This is not something you
just do at the end of life.

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually to regain
the human capacity

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move
between the light realms

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and the physical realm.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We really want to
achieve this while we're

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
alive to feel that
we are not limited

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
to one single dimension,
but we can actually

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:90%
move between dimensions.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.117 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that seems
to parallel even

00:21:18.117 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
what we hear in other early
religious traditions, what's

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
coded even within Christianity.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
This whole idea of being able
to move between dimensions

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
freely, which is something
we as human beings

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
have somewhat lost
the capacity for.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.461 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:37.865 align:middle line:84%
>> The question of the SkyGate,
the transfer of consciousness.

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the last piece of
the puzzle of my journey that

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
superseded everything else
that I researched before.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now traditionally,
this practice is

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
done at the end of a
three-year retreat.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
That means that you
have, for three years, 12

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to 15 hours of very
intense practices.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Every single day,
there is no day off.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Three years of that.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, you unlock
one by one vertically,

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
the famous chakras.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And when the last
one opens, there

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is this very physical
opening, right?

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Where your skull opens up.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You co-share that
mind for however

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:84%
briefly because you
have an omniscient mind.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
If the practice
is good, the stalk

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
will depend on the level
of the practitioner.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
For yogis, is actually-- is
a fairly thick like incense

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:90%
thick.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.495 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And it can go in quite deep.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The interesting part of
the practice is twofold.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
One that it is considered the
great insurance of the death.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You seal all the other
gates of the body

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
so that your
consciousness-- so to bypass

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
the need of
reincarnation, bypass

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the need of going
through purgatory,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
let's say, of these
transitory experiences

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
when you are in between
one life and another.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So there is also
this great confidence

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.917 align:middle line:90%
that practitioners have.

00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
They have a sign that is
both internal, that there

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
is a natural event at the
level of their awareness

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
which gives them

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge-- a direct knowledge
that there is somewhere else

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to go that is completely
independent from the reality

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of this body.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Very recently, we
started to think

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility of
uploading our mind, our self,

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
our identity into
either a synthetic mean

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
through the advent of
artificial intelligence

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to an actual robotic
form, or through cloning,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to upload our consciousness
into a cloned human being.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.337 align:middle line:84%
Many people still laugh at
these things as if fairy tales

00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:90%
whereas actually it's not.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>> They are investing
big time and big money.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And this will be a
reality very soon.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Just a few decades
away, even less.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So looking at
these, there exists

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge and a tradition
that is a tried and true--

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> --of people that have
learned to upload their identity

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and their conscious into
very complex light forms.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
The famous idea of
the body of light.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
As a society, if
we start to look

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
at these things a little more
seriously and empirically,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
give people the chance to
practice this, we would have,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
very soon, a generation of
people that, first of all,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
arrives at the moment
of death without fear

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
or having a better understanding
of what comes after.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Not having a fear of death, the
sense that that is just simply

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
passing through a door as a
transition of simply shedding

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
a layer and then dressing up in
another one that we just simply

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
cannot see or
comprehend from here.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It would change greatly
how we then perceive life

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and how we leave.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:55.497 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a really interesting blend.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
This idea of uploading
your consciousness

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
into an AI or a virtual reality
or these ancient technologies

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of uploading it into
the Buddha mind.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we make this relevant?

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Let me teach you
a little exercise

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to help you connect
to the SkyGate.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
What we're going
to do is take our,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
energy we've generated
some energy in our hands.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We also have learned how to move
and guide or direct our minds.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bring
our minds and our energy

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to this point on
the top of the head.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
It's straight up from
your ears and straight

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:90%
back from your nose.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:84%
This point here
is the culmination

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
of all the energy of the body.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Put your middle finger on
that point, breathe into it

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
and focus your mind here.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Focus your mind as you breathe.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
This point is our divine
connection to a higher power.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's where we get guidance.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to feel our
sense of purpose in life.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So hold your
attention there, press

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
in with your fingers a little
bit, take a deep breath.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And then release your
hands down to your sides.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Keep your attention on
the crown of your head

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and have that sense
that the whole opens up.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:84%
You can even imagine the
canopy of stars above your head

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and all that divine
light, the connection

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to the great mystery
of the universe.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Breathe into that and feel
that something touches

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.330 align:middle line:90%
you on that point.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Call it light, spirit,
a soulful connection.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Your personal connection to the
divine wisdom of the universe.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Let it flow through
you, breathe it in,

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and have that
sense of connection

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
to life's deeper mysteries
as they flow through you.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Becoming superhuman
takes some practice.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like watering a garden.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
You water those internal seeds
until they start to take root,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:90%
start to take shape.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, use these masters
to help to nurture

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.460 align:middle line:84%
the seeds of potential
that are within you.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, go back to these
exercises that we have learned.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
How to activate energy,
how to focus the mind,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
how to connect to the divine,
and bring them into your life.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Review those exercises.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Practice them with your
friends, your kids, your family,

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
your spouse, your grandmother,
bring those in to reality.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Your reality.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Because what you focus your
mind on changes reality

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:90%
as we've seen.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And what the SkyGate teaches us
is to bring in loving kindness,

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
compassion so that we can be
an agent of positive change

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring heaven
here on Earth.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've been asking this very
important inquiry, who am I?

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now this question isn't
necessarily something

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to answer because
life is mysterious,

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:84%
but an inquiry helps us to
feel a sense of guidance.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a guiding light into a
direction that we want to take.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I am something much more
than just this physical body

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.720 align:middle line:84%
with these emotions
and these thoughts.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You're a spirit
in physical form.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go meet David
as he meets up with Chung,

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.115 align:middle line:84%
a Tibetan Buddhist master who's
going to teach him of SkyGate.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Before going to retreat
for these six years,

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I will ask you to please
try to get a pearl--

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom that will endure
time of what would you leave?

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It was only through the grace
of my guru in Korea who took me

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
a lifetime to understand.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I've always been searching
for very technical,

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent,
and very practical ways

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:90%
to enact the very first step.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
We need to disconnect.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
We are locked inside our heads.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Constantly interacting with
what we think, what we say,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:84%
what we want, the past, present,
and future, our thoughts,

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
our feeling, our--

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Across the globe-- Africa, South
America, Siberia, China, India,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Indonesia.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The first initiation
is snap out.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
From very traumatic,
very extreme to less.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when there
is the silence,

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
there is that recognition
that, I am not in anymore.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I am out.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:90%
For the first time, I am here.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.205 align:middle line:90%
The mind goes off.

00:29:35.205 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Finally, I understood
this teaching of the Buddha.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The very structure of the
mandala with the four gates

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that lead toward the
center of the mandala,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.440 align:middle line:84%
so they are the very
representation of one

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of the very core
teachings that the Buddha

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:90%
gave to his own son, Rahula.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.636 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha is remembered as
a rebel who literally changed

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:90%
the world in his own way.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But not many people think of him
as a terrible father and a very

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
irresponsible person.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
He was married.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
He had a child,
small child, and he

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
was the head of a kingdom
with an old father.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly said,
no, enough of this.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The over-privileged
child that needs

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:84%
to rebel against his
upbringing and he

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
said, I'm going
to become a monk.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And he left his luxury life
in the palace, concubines,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the wife, children,
responsibility of the kingdom

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:90%
and he went off to the jungle.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.365 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:90%
To the jungle.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%
To the jungle.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:90%
The jungle.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Rahula.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Rahula.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.471 align:middle line:90%
Rahula.

00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Rahula logically grew up with
resentment, anger toward a man

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:90%
who abandoned him.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And when he met
his father again,

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
his father was
not a man anymore.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:90%
He was the awakened one.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We can't even picture
or imagine what

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:90%
this meeting would be about.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.735 align:middle line:84%
A very conflicted
young man meeting

00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the father who abandoned
him and then in the moment

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that he meets him,
he sees something

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.870 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of this being
that it's not of this world

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:90%
anymore, right?

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, unluckily we
don't know the details

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of the story, which I
like to fill in in my mind

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but what we know is
that the Buddha gave

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to Rahula a teaching
which became

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.470 align:middle line:90%
one of the pillars of Dharma.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
This teaching is called
the Brahma-viharas,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:90%
the abodes of creation.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Brahma means the
creator or the creation.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And those are the four
entrances of the mandala.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And what are the Brahma-viharas?

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The Brahma-vihara
is a practice--

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate practice
to move out of the cave.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Is the emotion from
Latin, exmotus, that which

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:90%
moves you from to.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
From a state of
containment, of limitation.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You are locked into your
resentment, your anger,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.610 align:middle line:84%
your hatred, your
fear towards--what?

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
First, the Buddha said love,
kindness, mercy, forgiveness,

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:90%
compassion, peace, joy.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the quotation
that he gave to his son.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, not many people
understand that.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But the very core
teaching of this practice

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:84%
was actually practice of
emotion because practicing

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
the Brahma-viharas to enter
into the abode of the creator,

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to enter into the
abode of creation

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
is not just an
analytical reflection

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%
on love and compassion.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:84%
It is to cultivate this emotion
until it bubbles up inside--

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
exmotus-- and it transports
you out of the cave.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.449 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people they
ask me, is superhuman

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:90%
doing all these magical feats?

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And I keep telling, no.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Superhuman is
understanding the steps

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that every person
can take, and only

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
when you go through
all the steps.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like a chemical
formula, and you

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:90%
have the result at the end.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If you put all the elements
in the right order,

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.810 align:middle line:84%
in the right sequence, and
they combine and there is

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:84%
a reaction, and that
is [NON-ENGLISH];;

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
practicing these emotions,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and that result is the
definition of superhuman.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.130 align:middle line:90%
