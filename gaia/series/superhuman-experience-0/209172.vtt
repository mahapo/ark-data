>> Six.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the first
year of school,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and there was this judo
dojo within the premises

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.675 align:middle line:84%
of the school, and I
was just magnetized.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I kind of begged my grandmother
and said send me to judo,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and she was all happy
because she raised me,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and she was a
military in the past.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
She was a sniper
during the war fighting

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the Nazis, the partisan, and
not just the normal sniper.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:90%
She was a sniper on skis.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, I
would finish school

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and instead of going
to do homework,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I would spend literally
five hours a day training,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
so I knew how to throw
a knife and big knives,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
or shoot a crossbow before I
was playing with transformers.

early on.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a
very important way

to channel stress or trauma.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised in a
bit of a certain way,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and my grandmother used
to quote me Einstein,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
a great scientist or
this great philosopher,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
described there's a
belief in this universe,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
in an energy that
we are part of,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%

developing special abilities,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.758 align:middle line:84%
for me the thing has always been
what are the common results?

What are the common
results, and what

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
are the common elements of each
of these practices, methodics?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, the people
that we see are

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
people that, to certain
extent, were picked up,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
one, because they were available
because many people just

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
refused to be on camera,
and second because I

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:90%
try to build a mandala.

It's not really so
important what they do,

people watch the movie,
that it's not so important

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
that you want,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%

Here's what I want
to be in the world.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
go.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.377 align:middle line:90%

00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%

it's a skill that is
acquired through practice.

It's easy to say I
relax, but it has

in its many definitions,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
for sure it's the
art of letting go.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Is a skill that is acquired.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let's not
speak about art.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It sounds very unclear.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a skill that is acquired
through repeated practice

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to learn to let go of
a mindset, a belief

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
system, a physical
tension, a certain emotion,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:90%
a certain behavior.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So literally you
learn to let it go,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:84%
not to hold it, because that
holding creates tension.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:90%
You are in tension.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, like in the movie
when you say grasp your fist.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what the mind is
doing, and then when you let--

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.068 align:middle line:84%
>> You actually go, but you
need to practice it, you know?

00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's what the Buddha said.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like you let your
mind, your thoughts

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
go like birds that
were locked in a cage,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and you just open the cage,
and let them fly away.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't hold them.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.775 align:middle line:90%
He said we try to hold all this.

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's easier said than done.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It is like months or
years of applied practice,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I like to
call it mind training,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because you really
train your mind

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to acquire skills
that we are just not

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:84%

that you are not trained
to do since you are small,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
they are harder to acquire.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and what's that guiding
light that we're aspiring to?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Very important question,
what is our potential as humans?

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:10%
The short answer
is it's infinite,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:10%
but it depends, actually,
on what our understanding

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:10%
of fundamental reality is.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:10%
So if we think that our identity
is a physical body with a mind,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:10%
then I think our
potential is limited.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Human beings experience
a very narrow bandwidth

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of perceptual activity,
whether it's sound,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
or taste, or smell,
or colors, or shapes.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing a
very limited bandwidth

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
through an instrument that
we call the human brain.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Even to know that, we have
to go to a deeper level.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Who knows that?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:90%
What knows that?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
What is it that wants to know
or understand human potential?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So we never experience
what we call the world.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We only experience
our own perceptions

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and our interpretations
of those perceptions.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:10%
What you're experiencing
is a human experience

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:10%
through a human brain and
through human consciousness.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the scientific
story, everybody

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
believes the scientific story,
but the scientific story

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:90%
is changing.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We say the universe
began with the Big Bang,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:90%
so what caused the Big Bang?

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can tell you.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Where did it happen?

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no location
because there was no space.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
When did it happen?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:90%
14 billion years ago.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:10%
You mean that time began
14 billion years ago,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:10%
or what was there before
the birth of time?

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
These are conundrums that
scientists cannot answer.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Even the best scientific
models cannot explain ordinary

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They ask you to think
of a beautiful sunset,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
you suddenly
experience an image.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no image in your brain.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Where do you experience colors?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
There are no colors
in the real world.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Every quality that we ascribe
to experience shapes, colors,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
smells, textures, fragrances,
sounds, sensations,

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, none of
these have a location

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
in this physical world.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:90%
The world is not physical.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
How are we getting
this hallucination?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's good because once we
understand how we create it,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
we can actually project
another more comfortable,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
upgraded illusion,
which would translate

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
into a more peaceful, just,
sustainable, healthier,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:90%
joyful world.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Upgrade our illusion.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Upgrade the illusion,
including the illusion

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:10%
of your body, so when you
say you fall, you hit a tree,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:10%
you get pain, well the tree is
an experience in consciousness,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:10%
your body is an experience
in consciousness,

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.587 align:middle line:10%
and so is the pain, an
experience in consciousness.

00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:22.295 align:middle line:84%
You just have to choose
your experiences.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
[SIREN]

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
By the way, there is no
such thing as that sound.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
That is a production
in consciousness.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I once met a great master who
said relaxation and peace is

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
who you are.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Tension and stress is who
you think you should be.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Now who we think we
should be creates

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of resistance, resistance
to the present moment,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:84%
so I want to teach
you an exercise.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's similar to what David said.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
When we're clenching that
fist, and then when we let go,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.303 align:middle line:84%
we feel the expansiveness
and the peace

00:19:56.303 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:90%
of the present moment.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Now this is called
blending with the contraction.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We hold a lot of excess
tension in our bodies.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you get tight in
your neck and shoulders?

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Think about where you hold
your stress in your body.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, this exercise
is going to help

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to transform that stress back
into relaxation, back into flow

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:90%
or inner peace within you.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So first, what
we're going to do is

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to contract our
bodies a little bit more

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:90%
than we normally do.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.142 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to tighten
your arm muscles,

00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
tighten the muscles in
your neck and shoulders,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
tighten your back and your
chest, squeeze your buttocks,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
squeeze the muscles of your
legs, take a deep breath

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and hold your breath, and
squeeze even your face.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Hold, hold, hold, and
squeeze everything tight,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale and
completely relax your body.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Relax your arms, your hands,
your back, your chest.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Take some slow, deep breaths
in and out through your nose,

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and feel that peace and
relaxation, that warmth

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
of energy, flow through you.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Take a slow, deep
breath, and just

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.195 align:middle line:84%
relax into the present
moment without resistance.

00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:17.528 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:17.528 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is interesting
because you as a Westerner seem

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to have access to these kind
of people where hardly anybody

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
in the world would have access
to so many people like this.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.698 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like this is one
of your special talents, gifts?

00:21:35.698 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember you telling
me about the visions

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.323 align:middle line:90%
that you would have.

00:21:38.323 --> 00:21:40.583 align:middle line:90%
>> When I was young, I saw them.

00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You had a vision of them.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I had visions, also dreams,
but transported somewhere else.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Very precise flashes,
images, faces, direction,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
like cues of how to find
them, and then I would simply

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:90%
act upon the vision.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Others is like word of mouth.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They knew that I was
looking for them,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and they sent
someone to meet me.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I talked
to a scientist,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and he reminded me that all
kinds of things in nature have

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
electricity.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Think of an electric eel.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It has a tremendous
amount of electricity.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Now some of these
masters have been

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
able to generate that
kind of electricity.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
He also reminded me that
every single cell in your body

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
has a little bit of a charge,
and you have 50 trillion cells,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and when you add that up,
it's about the strength

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:90%
of a bolt of lightning.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Now these masters have
trained their energy systems

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to be coherent, to line up,
and direct that force out

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:84%
from their body and in
and through other people.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we call this man Bagus but
we also called him the Leaf Man

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
because he has to hold a leaf.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
He has got so much charge that
if he touches you directly,

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:90%
it's too much.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be damaging to
the person he touches,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
so when he's activated, he
uses a leaf or a flower,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
he touches you, and it helps to
open up your body's circuits,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to expand the charge that
you can hold within yourself.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Now there's
exercises that we can

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.098 align:middle line:84%
do to activate the qi, the
life force energy within you.

00:23:12.098 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to try something?

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to feel
your electricity?

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Try this for 30 seconds with me.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to rub these
pressure points at the ends

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:90%
of your fingers together.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It's basically just
rubbing your fingernails

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
together back and forth.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Now breathe deep,
exhale all the way out.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.315 align:middle line:84%
Rub them vigorously like you're
starting a fire in your hands.

00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Come on, do this with me.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Breathe deep.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel
your inner power.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Energy is that first step to
unleashing your superhuman

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Take one more deep
breath, relax,

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
bring your hands to
your lap, and feel.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Just take a moment to feel
the energy and the electricity

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.045 align:middle line:90%
ignited in your hands.

00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
