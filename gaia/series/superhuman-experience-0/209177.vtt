00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Here, we're going to take
a deeper dive into Ariel,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
a person from Argentina who's
been scientifically studied

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:90%
many, many times.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
He has the ability to
put his hands on a table

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and lift or levitate that table
with his feeling frequencies.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
demystify it, but we'll

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
see that this is a very similar
concept to what Bing or Sergei

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
use when they're using
it in a combat situation

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
by moving people
without touching them.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
First, Ariel blends
with the table, blending

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
his energy, his feeling
attention with the table

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:90%
in order then to move it.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You see, sometimes, when
the cameras get turned on

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's watching,
that ability doesn't work.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
work 100% of the time.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
As you'll see in this episode,
in the beginning, when

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Ariel goes to move the
table, it doesn't work.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But what I find so extraordinary
in this behind the scenes look

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
is that all these extraordinary
people from all over the world,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
from South America to Russia
to China to Australia,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
come around and support.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And they demystify
this concept of how

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
to use the mind to move matter.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this table, it's a
wooden table that I had made

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:90%
for the occasion.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.435 align:middle line:84%
It's quite heavy, maybe about
10 kilos, something like this.

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And clearly, there are no props.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I will do, I will
put the hand on the table

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:90%
and move it without the fingers.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Just using magnetizing
for gravitating the table

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:90%
towards the end and tip it.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
This phenomena is, of course,
like most of these phenomena

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
not like this on
command, so it requires

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
a certain mental state.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's try all together to
create the best space for it.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When energy is observed,
it tends to change.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It tends to not behave
how you want it to behave.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is quantum physics.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Ariel is experiencing
this right now.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
He feels that the stare,
the expectation, it's

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.488 align:middle line:84%
blocking the energy to
move as it should move

00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or the event to happen
as it should happen.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So he really feels
the stare, and it's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:90%
a little heavy for him.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So we will join him now.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:10%
Let's see if we
can try together,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:10%
and we will listen
the suggestions also

Extend your energy into

You need to enter into it.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You need to feel the
table as part of you,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:90%
not separated from you.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Your hand and the table
are fused, they are one.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You need to think that
the table is not solid.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But he used the word
ethereal nearly.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you say you need
to zoom all your attention,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
all your focus into it and
forget anything else that

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:90%
is happening around.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:90%
That is it.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
That is how he does it
and is also his practice.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's look at
it a different way.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Your body might seem solid and
that table might seem solid.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But what physics
is telling us is

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that these bodies and these
objects aren't so solid.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Look at it under a
microscope, and we'll

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
see that the body is made
up of cells, cells made up

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
of molecules, molecules
made up of atoms.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
something atomically,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing but
energy, but vibration.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
The body, as they tell us,
is 99.999% empty space.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Not an emptiness of
nothing but an emptiness

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
a vibration that
responds to our minds.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so fascinating.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at your body, when

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
you look at the world around
you, know that it's vibration.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Why does it seem so solid?

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Because these electrons in
the atoms are moving so fast,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
it's like a very
fast fan moving.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It gives the
appearance of solidity.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.515 align:middle line:90%
But really, it's just energy.

00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I stand up close to him
and try to feel the frequency

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
of his energy, and then I
will work with this frequency.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I change my frequency
to his frequency.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe different way to
try change frequency of his

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
but it needs 2 weeks,
6 week to change

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:90%
his frequency to my frequency.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy for me to
change my frequency to him.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's easy
for me to connect with him.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:90%
It's only practice.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
When I only start
to feel energy,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:90%
I work with different people.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:10.305 align:middle line:84%
It was a big
workshop, for example.

00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:90%
600 people in the whole.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
different people.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:90%
It's this, this, this, this.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that all
people have another frequency

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:90%
of his energy.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And I work with these people,
and I try to feel these people.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I change this
person for another person

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and try to connect my
energy with this energy,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
a little different
frequency of my energy.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And this's only
practice, only practice.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have more
people for training,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:11:00.216 align:middle line:84%

big distance, in a big way.

Everyone, in the end,
can achieve some kind

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
of practical skill
to improve the life

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and to improve
natural intelligence

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:90%
through the everyday practice.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So actually, this is to
develop two kinds of energy.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:90%
One we call the positive energy.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
negative energy.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
According to Daoist name,
we call the positive spirit

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and also the negative spirit,
like some kind of energy

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:90%
combining our life.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
One is from the
blood, and blood can

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
generate the oxygen,
the chi, some gas,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:90%
chemical gas in the body.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are three substances,
combining the three together,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:90%
and then to strengthen the life.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So through the
training, you just

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
generate a more positive
spirit into the positive energy

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to your body, and the
positive condition

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
can attract outside the
natural positive energy

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.685 align:middle line:90%
and make it combining with you.

00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Once your body has
the negative energy,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the negative
energy would bother you--

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
bad luck, an accident.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So the positive energy
inside of your body

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:84%
can prevent that bad things
happen, bad luck, or accidents.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So through the
years of training,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
you can strengthen yourself,
strengthen the health condition

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of all the
diseases, threats,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and prevent any illness
and just secure your life

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and bring the
safety to your life.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's incredible
bringing all these masters

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
into one room to discuss
these very esoteric concepts,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and making it very practical.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's remember that the
appearance of solidity

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is a superstition-- that our
bodies and this physical world,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
really, is vibratory.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It's energy, and it responds
with this, with our minds.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
As we start to think and shift
our minds, as we concentrate,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
we can shift reality.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
saying is, let's

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
be a force for positivity,
for love and kindness,

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
for compassion,
for our humanity.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's make the world
a better place,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
because everything is connected.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Energy connects us.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Instead of our skin being
a barrier, it's a bridge.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected in this
infinite field of energy,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and we can infuse that field
with positive intentions.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
With love and kindness
and compassion,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.629 align:middle line:84%
we can truly shift the world
and make it a better place.

00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
