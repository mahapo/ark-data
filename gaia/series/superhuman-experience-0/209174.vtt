00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>> This episode has some
of my favorite moments.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about energy,
vibration, and using it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
for both martial arts
and healing arts.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I've studied both, but my path
took me into the healing arts.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Now in Chinese culture,
qi or energy, life force,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:84%
was the foundation,
the cornerstone

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of the medicine, of the
arts, of the martial arts,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.682 align:middle line:90%
of the culture.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to see here is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
how energy is used both for
healing and for martial arts.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now this describes a
particular sensitivity

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:90%
because energy is subtle.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not obvious.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Your body is obvious,
and here we're

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
going to see some very powerful,
physical men doing martial arts

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
practice, and being
he's a small man,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.382 align:middle line:84%
and he uses internal power,
and he throws this guy around.

00:01:11.382 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And then what we're
going to see is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to
move this bigger

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
guy without touching him.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.144 align:middle line:90%

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You can resist, right?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:90%
You can resist.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:90%
You're the best, right?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:90%
You resist me.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Resist like I would
do the physical fight.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I would do for you resist.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.364 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.364 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
You resist.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Resist, right?

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:90%
You can resist.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.442 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Protect him.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't get hurt.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all right?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Break.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Break.

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when we've
traveled around the world,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
we've seen masters that are
able to move people with

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:90%
their minds.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one I
use the word gentle.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't use energy.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
No use energy.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Very gentle.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You won't feel any hurt,
so this one is gentle.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So this show the energy
moving in a circle,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
like a whirlpool, like
water, like a tornado.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
They're turning, so
they generate energy,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:84%
so we're just using that
one for practical use.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
For people fit and healthy, for
improve the blood circulation.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> How are they able to do this?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They shift their mind,
and they shift reality.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Like you feel the energy.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You see the travel from the
mind, go reaching his body,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:90%
I let him just go.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> First, they quiet their mind.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they develop
non resistance.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
They're able to
move or dislocate

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
their mind from within their
bodies to another vantage

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
When you move the mind, you
shift the flow of energy,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and by shifting
the flow of energy,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
you create this movement
that changes reality.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So like that one,
it's the same thing.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:90%
You grab my wrist.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
You grab it, so I use
the energy shooting him.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
The martial arts.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:90%
The circle is called anti-force.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Just for a long time training,
like at the tai chi, right?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Long time training.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
They gather the energy,
develop the internal elixir.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
It's an elixir, right?

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Become a contraction, and then
out break to send the energy.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
The energy is similar
to the magnetic field.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic field circulating,
like in my arm, like the--

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
So like the one.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Just like the circulation,
the way it move--

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Sergei and Bing do this
in very different ways,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're from totally
different countries.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
He's going to disrupt
the image that

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
is formed inside a person's mind
about himself and the world.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
When that image
starts to change,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
he can do something
quite incredible.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Now he's going to do it
very softly, as you can see,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
but if he does it
for real, he can

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
stop your heart or your
brain from working,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.853 align:middle line:84%
so we appreciate the courage
of this gentleman here.

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
a very soft version.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.720 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What Sergei did with me,
this very gentle loving version,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and he said that it works
very well if you want to start

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:84%
to practice it at home
with your beloved,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:84%
with someone that you are very
connected with because you are

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
already emotionally connected,
so you heart is connected.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is already able
to enter into the person.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
This is very easy to start
to train with someone

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have a very close
emotional connection with.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
He says the other
parts of the training,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
using the same ability
for other means,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
such as in extreme
situation or in combat,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that is another training,
but it's not the message

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that he want to leave you
with, so train for love.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Train for wellness.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Make love, not war.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of this may seem
fantastical, and it really is,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but when you feel and
experience it for yourself,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:90%
it's truly incredible.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Now you might think
of it this way.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:84%
We used to have our
technology wired up, you know,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
phones and rotary
phones, and now there's

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
cell phones using
invisible energy.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And these ancient technologies
use this very same thing,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
this invisible energy
in powerful ways.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through
this episode,

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll demystify it for you so
that you understand actually

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:84%
what's going on because it
can be a little bit confusing,

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
both in the martial side, and
also in the healing art side,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
so there's really two
segments to this episode.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
One is Bing doing
his martial arts,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.852 align:middle line:84%
and the other is Ming
doing healing arts,

00:10:13.852 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and you'll even
have an opportunity

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to receive some energy
from this master.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's quantum.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond time and space.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be using
vibration, sound healing,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to create a healing effect
on you the audience,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
as well in the
episode on patients.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's my pleasure
to introduce Bing

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
as he talks about the history
of energy in Chinese culture.

>> People come from abroad,
so they're bringing different

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
culture, and different practice
of the different talent

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and capability.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing me, so
in this world is just huge,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%
all the background.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Every culture has
a deep [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
so we really need
to make the effort

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
to digging more and more so we
can really bring to the human,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and contribute to the
human life, to the world.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
The fundamental foundation.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the fundamental
foundation, regionally based

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
on, for example like
the shaman, and then

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the religion, and then the
witchcraft, so a lot of stuff.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it comes from there,
actually from the witchcraft,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:90%
like shaman.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The people, they are observing
nature, they got knowledge.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.872 align:middle line:84%
Accumulated knowledge, and then
they refined the knowledge,

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
they practice, so they are
getting better and better,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
so make it practical.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you catch all that?

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:84%
What Bing was talking about was
that these ancient cultures,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
especially in
China, were shamans.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:84%
They invoked the forces,
the forces of nature,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and brought it in into
applicable practices.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now he talked about
it as witchcraft

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and showed the history
in some of these books

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:84%
were documenting what was
happening in Chinese culture

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
at that time, so it went
from shamanistic culture,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
to witchcraft as he
called it or paganism,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and then it became a
science, an energetic science

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
both for the martial arts
and the healing arts,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
so things like the
five elements system

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
were born out of these
shamanistic cultures.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We call this
one just listening,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
the skill for practicing
every day in order to sense

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the energy, understand the
energy through the physical

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
contact, actually--

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> This is Bing in action, and
he's talking about listening

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:90%
skills.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Now listening skills
is the developing

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of sensitivity to energy.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you
kinesthetically listen

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to the energy in martial
arts and then make

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
movements and adjustments
based on this listening,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
so he's going to describe the
physical sensation of listening

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:90%
to somebody's energy.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Now this is true for
aikido, tai chi, kung fu,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and the subtle
internal martial arts.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see Bing move
from a physical practice,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
to a more energetically
sensitive practice,

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to even a distant practice,
where he's using energy

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to move an opponent,
and as you'll see,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:84%
this guy, his opponent,
is a lot bigger than him.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this
over and over again

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
where a smaller martial artist,
maybe even an older martial

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
artist, takes down the bigger,
physical, more powerful-- more

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
seemingly powerful-- opponent in
very easy and effortless ways,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
opportunity of energy.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Effortless power.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at Bing here.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Standing in this way so the
camera can see just by very

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
gently, by the energy, you see,
and without physical, right?

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Just the energy just coming in.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just like that.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And then you can do back.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:90%
You can do that job to me.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You can do that
job to me gradually.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Just come to me.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
You do that one.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Do that one.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Come to me.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Right, so now that the energy
already get redirected,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you see?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Do more.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Do more.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very good.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're really good, so
your level pretty high.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:90%
We will do it again.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Push towards me, the energy.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Push more.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.635 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You see already to my
body, it still push.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.035 align:middle line:84%
Slowly the energy already
redirected, right?

00:14:47.035 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It already off to me, so that
the energy already redirected,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:90%
come around off to me.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So from towards me,
directly towards me

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
push, and then redirect that
one around me, so that one just

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to tai chi, very important
the listening practice,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:84%
so if you know this one,
you can direct people

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:90%
with the strong force.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
When people strong force
push, so when you are strongly

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:90%
pushing me, you see?

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:90%
So I can redirect it, right?

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Can make it go around.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Try to redirect it, you
see, and then redirect it.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> The turning.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The more you apply the force,
the more you get a pullback,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You get removed.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're seeing here
is Bing receiving the energy,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and then amplifying it
as he gives it back.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now this listening skill
is a lot like water.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Think about standing
in a wave, and when

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
you're doing some sparring
with a martial artist

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
with this skill level, it feels
like you're standing in a wave.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It just knocks you over.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful experience.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, this
larger gentleman

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
is getting knocked
all over by Bing.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> See, you do quickly.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
You do quickly.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
If you do quickly
push me strongly,

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
affected more, right?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You do again.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This guy's just
getting taken down.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Reaction to you,
so the energy, right?

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do much work.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Now I do much work,
you see what happened.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you do.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Push me.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Bing's powerful.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to fight
a wave in the ocean.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just keeps knocking
you down over and over again

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:90%
as you can see.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
This energy, this energy
is often described

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.880 align:middle line:90%
as the water power, and it is.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying
to wrestle a wave,

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and it can be very frustrating
because these guys are

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
so powerful yet they're
so soft and subtle.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%
It's quite extraordinary.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
When you spar with a tai chi
master and an energy master,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get good at
getting up off the floor

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
because you'll just get
knocked over and over and over.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember myself getting
knocked across the floor

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
by a master, and I
tumbled in somersaults.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.755 align:middle line:84%
I did feel like I was
in a wave in the ocean.

00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:84%
Now what he's doing is he's
doing spiraling movements,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
and if you notice when you watch
water, it swirls and spirals,

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and so as he's making
contact with his opponent,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
he spirals and swirls because
that is a very powerful force,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and it'll create a
spiral, or a vortex,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
through the opponent
to knock them down.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, here.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it here?

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Here, I relax you, right?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And here, what you're seeing
is the more and more subtle

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
As we progress, he
builds this energy,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
and then he let's it release.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
It's called coiling.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
You coil the energy in,
and then when it releases,

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
it's uncoiling,
and what you'll see

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is that it knocks somebody
over with very little effort,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and then he knocks somebody
over without touching them

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.998 align:middle line:90%
through the energetic space.

00:18:12.998 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Paralyzing you, right?

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's when it
gets a little weird.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I need do it again, you see?

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You see, I do a lot,
so I'm really trained.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm really trained.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's scary.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's scary, right?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%

He's getting pushed

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.538 align:middle line:84%
getting pushed through

I can't get through that.

00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%

This is too challenging.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:90%
This is too hard.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
He's using energy,
traditional Chinese medicine,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:90%
but in a very unique way.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He's going to use
vibration and toning,

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
healing sounds if you
will, to create a healing

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
effect in the body.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Remember, sound is healing.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It moves energy.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Think of music.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
When you hear a great song
or your favorite song,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:90%
it moves you.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call it
emotion, energy in motion.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Sound has a healing
vibration, and Ming

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
is a master of healing
energy through sound,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and what you'll see is him
explaining energy, aura,

vibration, energy
field specific points,

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and then he's going to give
some treatments to some people

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and show how this
vibrational healing creates

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
a shift in the energy body,
and then in the physical body.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Think of your mind, your body,
your emotions like instruments.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they get out of tune.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:84%
We have to tune up
those instruments.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:90%
What gets your body out of tune?

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Stress, tension,
modern life, and what

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
he's showing you is how to tune
up the instrument of your mind

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and your body to a harmonious
vibration, a vibration

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of health, of aliveness, of
vibrancy, of emotional balance,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and mental clarity,
so here's Ming.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the
energy become weak,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
like the outer become weak, we
will have a lot of problems.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I will use the
mantra to activate

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:84%
your energy system, internal
energy system, and the outer.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:90%
This mantra, you listen to me.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Use your body to feel it.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
This mantra will activate
your energy system.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Let your body absorb
energy from surround.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
As we know, around us
there are huge energies.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:84%
In the universe, there
are huge energies.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
If we open our body,
let energy come

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in with the help of my mantra,
and then quickly in your body,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:90%
your energy will increase.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Your aura will become strong.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Your internal energy
will become powerful,

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we can sync
strongly, we feel strongly,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and stress will go.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:84%

little healing treatment?

Ming is going to do some
vibrational healing,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:90%
so here's what to do.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Get in a relaxed,
receptive state of mind.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Take some slow, deep
breaths, and as you

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%

tightness, and stress,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and a bringing in of
that harmony where

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the body, like a symphony,
is working together

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:90%
with that harmonious frequency.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:90%

This one, right?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Professor Ming said that it
was old blood that had come up

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
from toxins that were released,
and I feel a lot lighter today,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and healthier than I have been.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an image
that you hold of yourself

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of the representation that you
made of your body, outer body,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
inner body, of the
world and of others.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:84%
If you can change that
image, disrupt it at first,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
surprise yourself, and
suddenly change that image,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
it will change the
sensation, the feeling,

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:84%
the perception that
you have of your body,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:90%
of yourself, of the world.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The principle is very
simple, but the protocol

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that you apply the principle
with is the key to success.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, when you
say, oh, I'm already healthy,

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is only 1% of your mind, your
conscious mind, that says that.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:90%
99% of your mind doesn't agree.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying,
oh, I'm so happy.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy, but then
you are miserable.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Positive thinking doesn't work.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Same here.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't turn this one
into positive thinking.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Understand the
principle of it, so you

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
need to really see it
as perfectly healthy,

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and you need to do
this five second, ten

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:16.660 align:middle line:84%
second complete focus complete
clarity, 20, 30, 50 times

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
per day every day,
until from just

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
being a superficial
imprint is start

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to access the deep system
of belief in your mind.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you may wonder, oh, that
very much sounds like placebo.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, indeed, but this is
the science of placebo.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
How actually you can make it
work, how it actually works,

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:90%
and it does work.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at the
process in reverse,

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard
of phantom limbs.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:90%
People that have amputations.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The image of the amputated
part is still there.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The feelings and
sensations are still there,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.710 align:middle line:84%
although the physical
structure has been removed.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The pain disappears when finally
the mind accepts or erases

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the image of the part that
is already not there, then

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:90%
the pain subsides.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> David makes a really good
point because placebo is good

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
What your mind
believes to be true

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:84%
becomes true through your
body, but he brought up

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating point
about the phantom limb

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
because the body is then
sending energy to the mind,

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and what David is
really talking about

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is that it's one
continuous energy.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like the soil is
a continuous energy

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the tree.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's one extension of the
other, so the mind and the body

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:84%
flow back and forth with
energy and information,

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and what David
said is that we're

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing
this work and learning

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
how to work with the
mind, and learning

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
how to work with the
body to influence

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:90%
each other in meditation.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the art of
paying attention.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
The way in which we can liberate
both the body and the mind,

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
one flowing into the
other in a seamless flow.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We've been to exotic places and
met some extraordinary masters.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:84%
On the next journey, this master
has been trained for many years

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
to work with powerful
energy within ourselves.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.982 align:middle line:84%
>> It really shifts your whole
perspective of the world.

00:32:18.982 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you ready
for the adventure?
