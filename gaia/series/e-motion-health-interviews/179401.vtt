00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:90%
This is Ty Hungerford.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I'm once again
wearing a long-sleeved shirt.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And yes, once again
we're on the blue couch.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And yes, once again we have
another amazing human being,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Demartini.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Demartini,
welcome to the show.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have a
clearing modality called

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.466 align:middle line:84%
the Breakthrough
Experience, I believe.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Would you be at liberty to
elaborate on that a little bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:90%
for us?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Breakthrough
Experience is actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
a similar program that I've been
teaching now for over 25 years.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But inside that seminar
is a modality or a method

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I call the Demartini Method.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And the objective
with that method

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
is to help people transform
their perceptions about what's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
going on in their
life in such a way

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that everything that they see
in the way becomes on the way.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.517 align:middle line:84%
So they can see that things are
instructive, not obstructive.

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So they can become
masters of their destiny,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:90%
not victims of their history.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Because as we see
through life, if we're

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
seeing things in such a way
that we feel that they're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
interfering with what's
most meaningful to us,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we feel in a sense distraught
instead of inspired.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So I basically ask
people a series

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of questions that help
them reframe what's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
happening in such a way
where they look back

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and they say, thank you, because
anything they can't say thank

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
you for is baggage.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And anything that they can
say thank you for is fuel.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I was told by a teacher
many, many years ago--

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
almost 40 years ago--

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that never go into tomorrow
with today's baggage.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Always clear today's
baggage so you can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:90%
appreciate today and tomorrow.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So that leads me into
the next question.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's had a
difficult childhood,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic childhood,
is there processes

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
other than this that you could
give us that would help clear

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.084 align:middle line:90%
that out of the way?

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I just get to working
with somebody just before I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.534 align:middle line:84%
came here, where they believed
they had a traumatic childhood.

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
go into the detail.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.762 align:middle line:84%
>> "Believed" is
a keyword there.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>> They believed, yeah.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.744 align:middle line:84%
Because when we asked and
we did the Demartini method,

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and we actually
went through there

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and identified everything
that they thought

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
had happened to them
that they thought

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.187 align:middle line:84%
was terrible or traumatic
or tragic or this and that,

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
we went in there--
each one of those--

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and asked where they've done it.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.952 align:middle line:90%
How did it serve them?

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't stop until they
actually saw it and had tears

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude for those
experiences because it's never

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:90%
what happens.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It's our perception.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Then where they have done
it and where and when

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
they have done it-- how
did it serve those people?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
How this person had done
the opposite in other forms?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we judge
people and label people

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.646 align:middle line:84%
and don't look at the
other side of them.

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at who
is doing the opposite

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
at the moment they were doing
it to see an inherent balance

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And then ask if they
had done the opposite,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.054 align:middle line:84%
what we had hoped it
had done, our fantasy.

00:03:12.054 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
What would have
been the drawback?

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.511 align:middle line:84%
Because many times we
compare our current reality

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:17.709 align:middle line:84%
to a fantasy and never
appreciate our life.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So this series of
questions-- there's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:90%
48 questions in all that we ask.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.714 align:middle line:84%
And so when somebody has
this so-called "traumatic

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
experience" in
their life and they

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
want to run the
story and dwell on it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
at their therapist or whatever,
I find it's unwise to do so.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's wiser to go in there,
stop, look at what it is,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
find out where you've done it,
find out how it serves you,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.025 align:middle line:84%
go in and find out where
they've done the opposite,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
find out what where
was somebody doing

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.686 align:middle line:84%
the opposite at the same time,
and ask a series of questions.

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're done,
there's nothing there

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
except, thank you.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Any time you carry
around something

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that's emotionally charged
that hasn't been turned

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
into equanimity in
your mind, you're

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
going around storing
emotional baggage, which

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
keeps creating brain
noise in the mind

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and keeps you from being present
and inspired and uncertain

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:90%
about your life.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Your self-worth is
hindered every time

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
you store up those emotions
that aren't balanced

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and not grateful.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So then it's like you'd
still have the memories.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But energetically,
you've cleared it out.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the memories
are different.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of
running the story

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.224 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
old memory, you're

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:22.172 align:middle line:84%
now looking at the same event
but from an eyes of balance.

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
seeing a drawback

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.039 align:middle line:84%
without a benefit or a
benefit without a drawback,

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
resentful or infatuated.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you see both
of them together,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.706 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be grateful.

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is a perfectly
equilibrated mind

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
which opens up the
gateway of the heart.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
And inside the heart is love.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And love is a window
washer of the mind.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And it brings inspiration
to the mind and enthusiasm

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.001 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude, love,
inspiration, and enthusiasm

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
is powerful in healing the body.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of us out there
think there's some secret

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
to extreme wealth and success.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Is there any basic little steps
or a little nutshell philosophy

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can give us, Doctor,
on how we can achieve that?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You will automatically have
genuine wealth and fortune

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
in the area that's
highest on your values.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where we store our
inherent, you might say,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:90%
hidden wisdom of wealth.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But if we want
financial wealth, we

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.869 align:middle line:84%
have to value financial wealth
because money circulates

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
through the economy from
those who value it least

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:90%
to those who value it most.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody comes in
and they buy something,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
or they sell something for
me and they receive money,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that money will now go
into whatever they value.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So if they value clothes, it
will be converted into clothes

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and be consumed in
the form of clothes.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And the money will go into the
person selling the clothes.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.714 align:middle line:90%
Now they will receive the money.

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a highest
value on spiritual,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.296 align:middle line:84%
then they'll take
their money and put it

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in a spiritual quest.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.374 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
then the spiritual seller

00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
will automatically
take the money.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a high
value on making sure

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that they have a social
network of people,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.892 align:middle line:84%
then they'll put it
into social network.

00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But the money will eventually
circulate through the economy

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
until it gets to somebody
who values wealth.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And the person will have
wealth in the form of finances.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
That person will then
save it and invest it

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
and make money work for them.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The majority of people-- if
they have a devaluation of money

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.381 align:middle line:84%
and a valuation on
everything else,

00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
they will automatically
spend their money.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It becomes consumables.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.924 align:middle line:90%
That will depreciate, typically.

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And they will not have
money working for them.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
They'll be a slave to
money, not its master.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the person who truly
values wealth building

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and learns the art and science
and philosophy of wealth that

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
ends up having the
money working for them.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the best way someone
can increase their energy

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and increase their vibration?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Please, Doctor.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, any time somebody
is living congruently with

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
what's truly important to
them where they spontaneously

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
inspired from within to fulfill
what's meaningful to them,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
they automatically
have more vitality.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
your vitality in life

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is directly proportionate to
the vividness of your vision.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And your vision is
crystal clear except when

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you subordinate to the
influence of others

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and allow the others that
you look and see above you

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate you
with their own values.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:84%
When you do, you cloud the
clarity of your own vision

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and cloud the vitality you
have and lower the vibrations.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.355 align:middle line:84%
The highest vibrations you'll
have is when you're authentic.

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:84%
The highest
vibration you'll have

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
is when you're
inspired from within,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
pursuing the thing that's
truly most inspiring

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and meaningful to you.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.309 align:middle line:84%
If you go to bed with gratitude,
you wake up with inspiration.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you go through and
see everything in a way

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.933 align:middle line:84%
that it's helping
you get your dreams,

00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
then nothing's in your way.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that gratitude is
the key to this entire journey

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.446 align:middle line:90%
of an inspired life.

00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you want
to have wellness,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:84%
you want to have wealth,
you want to have genius,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
you want to have
influence, you want

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to have a love and
intimacy, you want

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
to have all the things that
most people are striving for,

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
it all starts with a
heart of gratitude.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Demartini, I suppose a
lot of folks out there would be

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
interested to know, apart
from obviously thinking right,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
is there physical things that
you do with the body to keep

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
yourself energized, to keep
yourself looking so young?

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I believe that it's
wise to drink a lot of water

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a believer that
it's a universal solvent.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't drink tea.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't drink coffee.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't drink any alcohol.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I drink some vegetable juices,
a tiny bit of fruit juices.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But I drink a lot of
water because I believe

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.317 align:middle line:90%
that we're here to be hydrated.

00:08:26.317 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the most universal solvent.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it helps our
physiology to the max.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
insane what some

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of the people in
this world eat today.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.151 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that they're living
to eat instead of eating

00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.895 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more into
eating quality foods.

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that there's anything

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that goes in my body
that's not quality food.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But I recommend any natural
alternative, preventive health.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Alternative-- that's the thing.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are
passing over some wise things

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that our body is trying
to guide us to do.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I also do believe
that it's wise to have

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
something that's a purpose,
that's inspiring to you.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a will
to live, you live longer.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They've just recently
discovered that.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Immune system, everything
sinking in, isn't it?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're living by
your highest values,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.465 align:middle line:84%
and you're living purposefully,
and you're inspired

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
by your life, you're
going to live longer.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
your time, Dr. Demartini.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I think I have to
watch it back 10 times

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:90%
to get all the information.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's been beautiful
to share with you.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Demartini has just
explained and just educated us

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:90%
with so much knowledge.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think it really comes
down to that perception.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
If you can just
change our perception,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
our reality changes.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.773 align:middle line:84%
And our quality of
life and everything

00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:90%
else will change, too.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for tuning in.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.466 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see you next time.

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:46.859 align:middle line:90%
