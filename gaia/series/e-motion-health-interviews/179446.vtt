[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the massive pleasure
today of visiting with Don

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Tolman.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
He's got me on some
preservative-free beer

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.009 align:middle line:90%
with plenty of lemons.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So we can tell you it's healthy.
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) It's good.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to
doing some talking right, Don?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> (SOUTHERN ACCENT) The
man doesn't mind to talk.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some
questions to ask you, Don.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've heard that you just
did a 30 day fast in Fiji.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I did.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you talk maybe about
the experiences with that?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Any revelations that you
had or any preparation

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to go into a 30 day fast?

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
it's interesting,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
because I've actually done
five 40 days on just water.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And the LA Film Factory
and Hollywood Films

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:90%
filmed the 40 days.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was out at Panama
City Beach, Florida.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of 40 days on
nothing but water and sunshine,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:84%
it was filmed, and I was
watched over 24 hours a day.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
with 13 people that

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
had been sent from Cornell
Medical, Johns Hopkins,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and other medical places that
were "supposedly" terminal.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they went
20 days on water,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and then I put them on fresh
juices, and I stayed on water.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those people
had absolutely no disease

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
conditions at the end of 20 days
on water and 20 days on juice.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 40
days on water, I

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
drank one liter, or one
quart, of fresh grape juice.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it energized
me so much, I said,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go out and run.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:90%
So I went out running.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The film crews jumped
into a pickup truck

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and put their cameras in
there and wanted to film me.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And I ran a marathon.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I went 26 miles.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No, come on, Don.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, true story.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's all documented.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, anyway, I decided
just a few months ago, OK,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm way overdue.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I need to give my body a
rest and strengthen it.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I went to Fiji and
went out to the Kadavu Islands.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Did the 30 days, And it's such
a brilliant, wonderful feeling.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I was on a little island.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.474 align:middle line:84%
No other humans
are on that island.

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a private island.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I got permission from one of
the chiefs of the cultures over

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
there to do it.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a little tent,
a little artesian spring

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to get the water, laid in the
sunshine, swimmed in the ocean.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was so fascinating,
because it brought back

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of memories that
are contained within us.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
There's three levels of
intelligence and cognitive

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:90%
process--

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that there is a conscious,
there's the subconscious,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's the superconscious,
the superconsciousness.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious
and superconsciousness

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:90%
work together.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> To access--

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Mhm, and push information
into the conscious beta wave

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:90%
realm of the brain.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know from my own
experience that it's true.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so fascinating to
see and to hear audio video

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
memory mind movies of things
right out in front of you while

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:90%
you're fully awake.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Most of us have to go to sleep.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Then we dream.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But during that fasting
state of extended fasting,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
have moments of being

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
able to dream and see those
things while you're fully

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:90%
awake.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had to come up
with a name for it.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just called it moving
optical memory projections.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
understand that it's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
a record of a memory
projected out in front of you

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to see in front of
you, you'll think

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
it's a three-dimensional
physical experience.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It is so brilliant, and it's
just a fascinating experience--

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
very, very healthy mentally,
physically, emotionally,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and even socially
in our personalities

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:90%
to do that kind of thing.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.164 align:middle line:90%
>> But you wouldn't want to be--

00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
you can't be in a
stressful environment.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.538 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a lot
of responsibilities.

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you're
doing a fast like that,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
it's just in the right
environment, rest, sunshine.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you go out and you
fast in an environment that is

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
unstressed, and you
can get into the sun,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
you're breathing
outdoor, fresh air,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can walk when you feel
like it and lay down when you

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
feel like it and just
go with the feelings.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
It's so fascinating when you
come through that experience

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and take the first bite of a
fruit or a vegetable and nut

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.607 align:middle line:84%
or a seed, whatever
attracts you.

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And you totally,
completely, insalivate it,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the awakening of the powers
of the nature and the physics

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
around us and how we are
completely tied into that,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:90%
it is brilliant.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that more
people can get back

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:90%
into that kind of an experience.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating history to
go back into the ancient records

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and what's actually
recorded and held

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.331 align:middle line:84%
in collections of ancient
and arcane materials

00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that are still in
collections today.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.996 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them today, though,
are under lock and key,

00:05:49.996 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get in.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But back then, it was a
process of understanding

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
through scholarly, meaning
observation of nature,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wanted to go
what was called the Rainbow

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Bridge, the seven
colors of the rainbow,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:84%
red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, and violet.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they would go seven days
and eat nothing but red food

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:90%
on the day they were born on.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they'd
go to orange food,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
the next day, yellow food.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.414 align:middle line:84%
And people can do
this just starting out

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:90%
at any time they want.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
They can try to walk
the Rainbow Bridge.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancient wisdom
was at the end of the rainbow

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
is a pot of gold, a
vessel of purity and life

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and health and shininess.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
You hit a point of going
through this process

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
to where you realize
the reason you

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
can see a rainbow
in the sky, the sun

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is shining through
molecules of water,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
and it creates a rainbow.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Water contains all the
frequencies of the light.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> The water fast.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The water fast-- so when
you go on water, there's fast,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
which is eating
the foods, faster,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
drinking the juices
of the foods,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and the fastest path of healing,
emotionally, physically,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
mentally, socially, is to
be able to go on water.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But you don't do that unless
you're at least 22 years old.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I lived amongst about--

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- about
14, 15 different

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
off the grid cultures
that were disease-free,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:90%
long lived, and happy.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
They had no doctors.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They had no hospitals.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They had no miracle
supplements in a capsule form.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet even anthropologists who
have studied these groups know,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
these people, average
lifespan, 120 to 155 years.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
was interested in.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what got me going.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to bring this
information back to the world.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
That's all they wanted
was for their descendants

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to know this stuff.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
realize the ancient observers

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
knew there is not an animal
on the face of this Earth that

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:90%
will eat.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.422 align:middle line:90%
They won't eat if they're sick.

00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:25.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, the sick dog, I've
seen it happen a million times.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> They just stop, you know?

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
is, they won't go back

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
into eating until they
intuitively, instinctively

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:90%
know, my body's ready.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And going on nothing but
water and air and sunshine,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
they know instinctively
that's the fastest path.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And as humans,
we've been trained.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Ah, don't listen to that.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You skip a meal, you could
become comatose and die.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, eating chicken soup,
you need chicken soup when

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
you're sick.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Quick.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.894 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's crazy.

00:08:57.894 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is like the
worst thing you could do.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Sick, stop eating.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Rest.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Drink water.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:90%
And you will heal.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So going on what
you're saying then, Don,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.034 align:middle line:84%
it's a gauge you find
out for yourself.

00:09:09.034 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:84%
You start experimenting with it,
do little bits and pieces here,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and then just slowly
get more confidence.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll work out what's
the best method for you.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:90%
It's your body.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Go with what you feel.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't live your life based
on other people trying

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to live your life for
you and tell you how.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Opinions.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, hear things, but go
with how you feel about what

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:90%
you hear.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Does it seem logical?

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Does it seem reasonable?

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
What is my intuitive gut
feeling about what I'm hearing

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm being exposed to?

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You honor that, and
you can't go wrong.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.224 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you start doing it,
Don, maybe do some research.

00:09:49.224 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing a
three day, four day fast,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
so that when you break the fast,
and you do go to eat something,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you're using the right
types of foods and stuff.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But anyone can find
that on Google.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:90%
You can just work it out.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, you can.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
best and easiest

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
is when you break a fast of
one day, three days, 10 days,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:90%
40 days, is fruit.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Fruit, if you look
up the word, it

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:90%
means to add splendor and life.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Fruit is one of the
healthiest things

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can reintroduce
into the body

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:90%
after an extended fast.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The word vegetable
means to make strong

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and to strengthen,
fruit, splendor and life.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you break a fast,
fruit is one of the best things

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.017 align:middle line:90%
that you can take in.

00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think we can get rid
of negative trapped emotion out

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.257 align:middle line:90%
of our body through fasting?

00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that you know about?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Or is that a possibility?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I know for a
fact that you can.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you are crushed because
of loss and grief of a loved

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
one or some other thing,
whenever you're stressed,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
or your buttons are pushed, and
you're just angry all the time

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and moving, they used
to call it venting,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to vent your emotions,
to vent discomforts

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
from the internal
part of the body even.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you keep
the body venting,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's not closed off, you
prevent ongoing problems.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was prevention.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We breathe in and out
over 20,000 times a day.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And within that
physiological process,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
we're getting rid of
toxins in metabolic ways

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
through breathing.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The skin will evaporate
about a liter or a liter

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and a half of water
every 24 to 30 hours.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:90%
It's venting all the time.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
When we urinate, when we have a
bowel movement, we're venting.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:90%
We're clearing.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions can be
so toxic it slows down

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:90%
the venting process.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when you fast, it
speeds up the venting.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just like when people
talk about "having the flu."

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
realize the flu is

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the body kicking up, venting,
because it hasn't been venting.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
You're dehydrated.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
You're toxic.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
You're this.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You're that.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what influenza means,
not flueing or not venting.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
have emotional flu.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not venting.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:84%
To be able to express a
bit, not in anger, not

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
in all of these things,
when you just fast, you

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
are venting and healing the
emotions at such a level,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:90%
it's mind-boggling.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people, when
they're completely stressed

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and having negative
emotions and everything,

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:90%
they lose their appetite.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them think,
oh, I'd better eat anyway.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And so then they
continue the negativity

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional process.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like, stop it.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.221 align:middle line:84%
Drink a lot of water
and vent the emotions,

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
the body would--

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The body's just
begging for you to stop.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It actually is.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So Don, on top of
obviously eating whole foods,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
detoxing as much as we can,
is there any other modalities,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
like is there any sort of
practitioners that you go

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
and see?

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
you would recommend to us

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to do on top of those things?

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything that is noninvasive
for the human body--

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
people who are skilled
at chiropractic,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that's a brilliant wisdom
for thousands of years.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmaceutical
medical industry

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
attacked it and said,
oh, they're quacks.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They're this.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
People who are skilled
at that, it's brilliant.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Massage, even deep
lymphatic massage,

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.097 align:middle line:84%
can help the healing
motions in the physical body

00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Just get stuff that
might be trapped in.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Gravitational fed colonics
from colonic therapy,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
as long as its
gravity flow, perfect.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But movement, Tai chi,
yoga, stretching--

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Breathing, the
controlled breathing.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people
have forgotten.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
There's not an animal on this
Earth that if it just woke up

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
it'll get up and go.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%
No, they rotate.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
They stretch.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And you can see horses do it.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Cows do it.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Cats.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Cats do it.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Dogs do it.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And we get up in the
morning in our bed

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and just jump out of bed and go.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Go back.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Lay in bed.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up, take the
time to scrunch your neck,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
rotate your head each
way, do your shoulders,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
stretch your arms,
rotate your wrist,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
lift your legs up, bend
the knees up to the chest,

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:90%
rotate your ankles.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Get some chi
flowing around, huh?

00:15:08.232 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You only do that for
one or two minutes.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Then get out of bed.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And you watch what happens to
your emotions within just two

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
or four days of
doing that each day.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people don't
even have a clue anymore.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Wouldn't even
consider doing that.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are the
things that I support,

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
things that are not invasive,
that actually lift the human

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:90%
body--

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
love, intimacy, sexuality,
hugs, healing, healing.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Affection and affection.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Too many couples
get up in the morning,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're so busy.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, bye, see you later.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Gah, and it creates distance and
a failure of the relationship

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:10%
through emotions that
are stressed and empty.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.782 align:middle line:90%
>> When there's no need for it.

00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Hug.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands on
somebody's face

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that you love and
look in their eyes.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are the
window to the soul.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Heal each other.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Even children, come on.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Don, there's a lot of people
that I meet who are suffering

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
from fatigue.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.474 align:middle line:84%
Just they're down,
adrenal fatigue.

00:16:26.474 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
we can easily overcome?

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there some-- say,
in a nutshell, what's

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:90%
a quick way to get around that?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Again it's fast,
faster, and fastest.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the things people
need to understand is how you

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
shut down the adrenals to
where you don't have adrenaline

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:90%
pumping and giving you energy.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline, a lot of
people don't understand.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
pancreas, which

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
produces two mega hormones
that they know of.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
One is insulin, which makes
you tired and lethargic

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and lay down layers of fat to
protect the nervous system.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The other mega
hormone is glucagon.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Glucagon is produced
by the pancreas,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and it produces in the
adrenals, "adrenaline."

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
So you feel energized.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all of that comes
from what today in studies

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
of "chemistry" calls
carbohydrates or sugars.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
There are fast
sugars, and there are

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%
slow sugars that they know of.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Fast sugars come
from refined sugars,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
synthetically, artificially,
commercially manufactured

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:90%
sugars.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Then artificial chemical
sweeteners, like aspartame

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Deadly poison.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Those are fast sugars.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:90%
They are toxic and even deadly.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
They are neurodegeneratives
and shut down

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:84%
the production of glucagon,
and therefore, create fatigue.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They give you a sugar
high, and then you crash.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a big
percentage of fast food.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the
biggest things out there.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You get a high,
and you crash.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So you have more,
high, crash, have more.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Large molecules of sugars
come from fruits and things

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:90%
like sweet potatoes.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
A sweet potato looks
just like the pancreas.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We've had people that were
diagnosed as type 1 diabetics

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and type 2 diabetes.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They throw the insulin
in the garbage.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Or they take baby
steps and cut down

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
dosage, whatever they're
mentally and emotionally

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
capable of.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready for, yeah.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And they go on nothing but
a fruit and sweet potato diet.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Within 30 days, we
have over 1,000 people

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
who were type 1 diabetics,
no longer diabetic.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Damn.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And fatigue, adrenal fatigue,
fruit is the number one healer

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:90%
of that problem.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Fast sugars cross the blood
brain barrier so quickly

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:90%
it gives you a spike.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But the brain knows
you're in danger,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
so it causes the pancreas
to produce insulin

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to make you tired and
fatigued, slow you down.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know what, fruit,
and you hear these girls, oh,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat fruit.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It puts on weight.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:90%
It puts on weight.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.644 align:middle line:90%
There's so-- oh, man.

00:19:17.644 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's such a scam.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, watermelon, it
has 45 teaspoons

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:90%
of sugar just in one piece.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.487 align:middle line:90%
People are so--

00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Conditioned, huh?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Conditioned and blind, they
believe all of the "bought

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and paid for" pharmaceutical
crap in order to sell aspartame

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:90%
and refined sugars and insulin.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
If you'll just go on a fruit
diet, it will blow you away.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Healed.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.448 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people,
when they start getting

00:19:47.448 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
into the fruit and vegetables,
they're a bit scared about

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:90%
pesticides, herbicides.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Say we can't find organics,
or we can't afford organics.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Can we quickly make normal
vegetables OK to eat?

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing
that kind of crushes me

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
in the organic movement.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the organic foods
they buy in the United States

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and some other countries
has been in cold storage

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
for upwards of
three to four years.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.214 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
fresh in this season.

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean, frozen?

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they set them
out on the shelves,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
squirt them with water
so they look "fresh."

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The nutritional components
of the cells of those plants

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:90%
are diminished.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you have locally grown
farmers markets organics,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
fabulous.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can't get organic,
what we did at Arizona State

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
University, a good friend
of mine, Norman Walker--

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:90%
he's gone now.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:84%
He was told by doctors he
would be dead at age 52,

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and he was 50 at the time.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:90%
He walked away from that.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Didn't do it.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:90%
He and I were neighbors.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
He decided to go with juices.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
He died at age 109.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No shit.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Never went to
the doctor's again.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
We went into the
lab, because he was

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:84%
a professor of
agriculture and chemistry

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:90%
at Arizona State University.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
He had a spectral
analysis machine equipment

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:90%
He said, come on with me.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you something,
because in the future,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
important to the people.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And I said, yeah, let's go.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We went down into
Scottsdale at Fifth Avenue,

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.820 align:middle line:84%
went to the farmers
markets, got organic food,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:84%
went over to a store
called Alpha Beta, which

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.744 align:middle line:84%
was not organic food,
just a regular produce--

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Kroger or whatever.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And we went in
there, and he got that.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
We went into the lab, and
he chopped up the inorganic,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.695 align:middle line:90%
chopped up some of the organic.

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
The inorganic, he put it
into spectral analysis,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and it showed over 30 to 35
toxic poisonous chemicals that

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
were insecticides, pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
It was not good.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, now watch this.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
He took the organic
food, put it in.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but here's what
people don't understand.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
All of the plants, from grass
to trees to fruits to vegetables

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to all of them, produce
allele chemicals

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.379 align:middle line:84%
that will not allow inside
the food any toxicities.

00:22:15.379 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's how they survive.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And I said, OK, wow, huh.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, watch this.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:10%
He goes over and gets the
inorganic food, the other half

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:10%
that he hadn't chopped
up, chopped it up,

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:10%
and put it into one cup,
because we had so much of it.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
He did one cup of apple cider
vinegar, two liters of water,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and he put it into there
and swirled it around

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and then rinsed it off.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Put it in spectral analysis.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It was as clean as
the organic food.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't have
to chop it up first.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:84%
He said I'll just keep
some of this whole,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:90%
and he set it over there.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He just did that, washed it,
then put it in-- nothing.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And so people need to know that.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's important information.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.064 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely important.

00:23:02.064 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And the cost of organic
food is a financial scam.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oof.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It costs less to grow that
than all of the herbicides,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
pesticides, fungicides,
and all of that.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can easily
get around it.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Get around it.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Apple cider vinegar.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Apple cider vinegar.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> A couple of extra minutes
in preparation, boom.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a
lot of the food to do,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
just put in four or five
tablespoons in a half

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
a liter of water, swish
it around, rinse it off.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
You're good to go.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.054 align:middle line:10%
When the pharmakeia, the
poison makers, went in--

00:23:34.054 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Who are the
poison makers, man?

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:10%
>> --to Alexandria--

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.285 align:middle line:10%
>> What was the poison marker?

00:23:38.285 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The poison makers all
throughout history have hated

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:10%
scholars and healers.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They wanted people
to have poisons

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and to have to come
to them to get it.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The word pharmaceutical
means poison maker.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It's that industry.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So it goes back way, way--

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the earliest dynasties
of Egypt, the pharmaceuticals,

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
the poison makers,
murdered the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
the lady healers of
Egypt, murdered them all.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:90%
They wanted them gone.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And so then you come
down through time,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.446 align:middle line:90%
it happened again and again.

00:24:12.446 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It happened in 600 BC.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They went into the
Pythagorean Academy

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
where they embraced
scholarly genius and healing.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras and all the ones
there, they murdered them,

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:90%
burnt the records.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, as far as records
show, Pythagoras escaped.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
In 326 AD, all of the scholar
healers from around the world

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
gathered in the
Greco-Roman Empire

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and built a collection
of stones so they

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
could keep the records
from all the cultures there

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:90%
called the Alexandrian Library.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The pharmakeia heard
about it, went over there,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
murdered all of them,
and burnt the records.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
They found out the
scholars and the healers

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
had built a backup
collection in Ephesus.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So they went over there and
murdered them and burned it.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes on and on.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But finally, the men and
women scholars and healers

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:90%
had to go underground.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
When the new America was being
put together, they came there.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The Wicca, the women
of wisdom and healing,

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
genius female scholars,
and then the powers

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of Europe and the
pharmakeia and everything

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
came over there, found them,
burnt them, murdered them,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:90%
got rid of all of them again.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Again.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient scholars,
which means observers--

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:84%
scholar is anyone who naturally
observes out of interest.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Every child born on
the face of this Earth

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
is a natural scholastic genius.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Kids are on fire.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:90%
They're interested.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to observe.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:90%
They use their senses.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll pick stuff up and
taste it and say, oh, yuck.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And they go on.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they're shoved into
brick and mortar buildings

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:84%
to sit in neat
little rows to chant

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
memorized, preselected
answers on curriculum that

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
are put into place by
multinational corporations

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to gain control and to get you
to get a career to help them.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go worker bees.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's go worker bees.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And these little kids--

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
and I'm thankful.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been barking this
for over 40 years.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But just in the
last seven years,

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:84%
documentaries and others
are now coming forward

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and exposing formal education
is ruining the creative genius.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
They master language
on their own.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
They know hundreds of words
by age one and a half,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and they've mastered
that language

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:90%
typically by around age five.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They know thousands of words,
and they can speak any language

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:90%
that they have been exposed to.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go to school.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't chant,
memorize anything.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:84%
They didn't sit in
neat little rows.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
They weren't put on Ritalin
and all the other drugs.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
They master the ability to speak
and communicate on their own.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is they
lose the scholastic genius

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:84%
by having to chant and memorize
these preselected answers

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to put in blanks to get
a "grade that is good."

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And they're not even interested.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of young
children lose their love

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
of learning, their
confidence, their self-esteem.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:10%
But the worst thing is
they lose who they are

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:10%
and who they were coming
into the world on fire.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:10%
You get into the ancient
records of communities

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient world,
they have records

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:10%
that show the
measures of distance

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth to the
moon and to 13 planets.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Look up Haumea, and Eris, and
Ceres, and all the others.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Look them up.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
13 planets, and they wrote
and recorded the distance

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth to those
planets, all of them.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And today's
astrophysicists agree

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:middle line:90%
that that's exactly right.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
How did they know
that back then?

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So the 13 on the body,
the 13 points, what is it?

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, because
anciently, they knew.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And they taught it.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And even at medical
university studies,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the researchers
know it's correct.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.602 align:middle line:90%
There is only one disease.

00:28:33.602 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
You can look up on
the internet, how many

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:90%
human diseases are there?

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And it'll show 16,024,
36,000, all this stuff.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
There's only one-- chaos
at the atomic level

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of the body that leads
to molecular chaos that

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
leads to cellular chaos.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:84%
There's only two causes of
any discomfort or disease

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:90%
They knew it.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Toxicity and
deficiency, that's it.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no mystery here.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You're either toxic,
or you're deficient.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They knew there were doorways
into the body for toxicities

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:90%
to enter and to also be removed.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Today, in the
medical world, it's

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
called enterologies, doorways
to enter and to remove.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
The 13 enterologies
was the sacredness

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
of the teachers of
the ancient world.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
You have 13 doors into
and out of the body

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that creates disease and
clears and heals disease.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, and the skin is number 12.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Poisons and toxicities
can go through the skin,

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and they can come
out of the skin.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the modern
world, you would not

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.167 align:middle line:84%
believe the toxic chemicals
people put on their skin--

00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Moisturizers, shampoos.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --on their hair, all
this stuff, exactly.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And the 13th was called
the always seeing eye.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, we know it as
imagination, thoughts.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts can
be toxic or healing,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and your thoughts
create your emotions
