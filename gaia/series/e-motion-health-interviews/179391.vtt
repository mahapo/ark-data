00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, folks.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:90%
This is Ty Hungerford.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And today, we have
something super special.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
We have an amazing,
beautiful man.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton is
here with us today.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
He wrote these two
wonderful books,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
"The Biology of Belief"--
this is a bestseller--

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and his latest book,
"The Honeymoon Effect."

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Folks, if you read
these books, they

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
will empower every aspect of
your life on a cellular level

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
onto what you produce, money, to
love, and everything you have.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.774 align:middle line:84%
You really digest these
books and go through.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's got all these
different healing modalities.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Take it on board.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Work on your subconscious.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.928 align:middle line:84%
Get the negative energy
out of your body,

00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:07.537 align:middle line:84%
and these will actually
totally change your life.

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.745 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, thank you so much
for coming on the show, man.

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Ty, thank you so
much for this opportunity.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I so appreciate
everything you guys

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
are doing in changing
our world for the better.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, thank you, sir.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a few questions
for you today, obviously, Bruce.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The first one, say if someone
hasn't read these books.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.921 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe they haven't
come to that point where they

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.974 align:middle line:84%
realize they are a co-creator in
this magnificent life of ours.

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Where is a nice place
for them to start,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.042 align:middle line:90%
like a good starting point?

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing is
to really understand that

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:90%
we've been programmed.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And most people have seen
the movie "The Matrix."

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, "The
Matrix" is a science fiction

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
movie, but it's
actually a documentary.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.429 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is that
our lives are really

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
coming from the program and
not from our deepest wishes

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and desires.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So once we understand
the difference

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
between the programming
and our conscious mind,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
which is really where
we live, then we

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
begin to take an opportunity
to let go of the program

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and start to live from your
deepest wishes, desires,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and aspirations.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can change your
life instantaneously

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching in
a medical school.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching the
concept about genes.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.377 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, of course,
has heard about genes.

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
genes control their lives.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So running in my family is
diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, my goodness,
I'm a recipient of such genes,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:90%
and this is going to be my life.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is a belief
of victimization,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.387 align:middle line:90%
a victimization of heredity.

00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's running in my heredity, and
I'm going to get these genes.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And I can't control it.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a new biology that
switches this whole thing

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
around, because it reveals that
genes don't control our lives.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's our perceptions and our
response to the environment.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.785 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment
that influence the genes.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the relevance
about that is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
since we can change
our perceptions,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
so we can change
our environment,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:90%
then we're not victims.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.619 align:middle line:90%
We're actually masters.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:90%
But we have to know that.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to really come
from an understanding

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:90%
that we are creating our lives.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if your belief
is you're a victim,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
its belief is
translated into biology.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You become a victim if
that's what you believe.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of prove
scientifically and biologically

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.567 align:middle line:84%
that the proof of
that, that we, in fact,

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
are in control of our
genes, that our genes aren't

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.681 align:middle line:90%
controlling our lives.

00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a brief,
sort of bird's eye view

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:90%
of how you prove that, Bruce?

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
simple experiment.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
About 47 years ago, I
was cloning stem cells.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, back 47 years
ago, there was only

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.736 align:middle line:84%
a handful of us
in the whole world

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
even knew what a stem cell is.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.714 align:middle line:84%
A stem cell is an embryonic
cell in your body.

00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we have
all these embryonic cells

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.671 align:middle line:84%
is because cells have
a life, and they die.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.414 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't
replace the cells,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
then it won't be very long
before all our cells die,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.413 align:middle line:90%
and then we're gone.

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So a stem cell is a
multi-potential embryonic cell.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's the work, simple.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I get one stem cell,
put in a dish by itself,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and it divides every 10 hours.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So first 1, and then 2, 4, 8,
16, and the cells keep going.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
After a week, I've got 50,000
cells in the Petri dish.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But here's the most
important point.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:90%
They all came from one parent.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are 50,000
genetically identical cells.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, now here's the experiment.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I take that community,
and I break them up

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
into three different
Petri dishes.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I change the environment
a little bit in each dish.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Now, cells are like fish.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:90%
They live in a fluid.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.331 align:middle line:84%
So I create like an
aquarium with all the things

00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:90%
they need to live in it.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:90%
That's called the environment.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
And I change the composition
of the environment a little bit

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:90%
in each dish.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, what happens is in dish
one, I get muscle cells.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
In dish two, I end up with
a different environment--

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
get bone cells.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
In dish three, yet a
different environment,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I end up with fat cells.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, the whole point was this.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.064 align:middle line:84%
What controls the
fate of the cells?

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And you say, well, genetics.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
I go no, no.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.746 align:middle line:84%
They're all
genetically the same.

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fate of the
cell wasn't determined

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
by the genetics.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It was determined by
the environment, OK?

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the information
in the environment

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.369 align:middle line:84%
is really what's involved
with selecting our genes.

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So people will say, well,
OK, that's really nice.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.929 align:middle line:90%
You got cells in a plastic dish.

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
What the heck does that
have to do with me?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
here's the fun part.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
You look in the mirror.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Ty, you look.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You see this handsome
guy looking back.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
You say, that's Ty.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a single human
being and a single organism.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I go, a slight misperception,
for this reason--

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:90%
you're not a single entity.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
You're made out of
50 trillion cells.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:90%
The cells are the living entity.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
You, by actual biological
definition, you're a community.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So you're a community
of 50 trillion cells.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the fun part is you're
a skin-covered Petri dish

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.104 align:middle line:90%
with 50 trillion cells inside.

00:05:27.104 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have an environment,
a culture medium,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's called blood.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And the chemical
composition of the blood

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
determines the
fate of the cells.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
in my plastic dish.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.186 align:middle line:84%
So to a cell, does
it make a difference

00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
if it's in the plastic
dish or the skin dish?

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
No, it's still going to
read the environment.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So I say, ah, then the
blood is the culture medium,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and the composition of the
blood controls the genetics.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.145 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, yeah, now
here's the cool part.

00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I say, but as I showed
in the Petri dish,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.007 align:middle line:84%
if I change the composition
of the culture medium,

00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I changed the fate of the cells.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, who
or what controls

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.571 align:middle line:84%
the chemical
composition of my blood?

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:90%
So we go up to the next level.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I say the brain is the chemist.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The brain is what releases
the chemistry in the blood.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.907 align:middle line:90%
And then you go one more step.

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You say, but what
chemicals should the brain

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.698 align:middle line:90%
release into the blood?

00:06:12.698 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I go, next
level up, the mind.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
What do you perceive?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So I say, for a person,
I say, here we are.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I stand here.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I open up my eyes, and
I see someone I love.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, my mind perceives
love and translates that

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
through the brain
into chemistry,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
such as dopamine, the pleasure
chemical, oxytocin, the bonding

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
chemical, vasopressin,
attractiveness, growth hormone,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
which enhances the
growth of the cells.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So when a person sees love,
experiences love, the brain

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
releases a cocktail of
these wonderful chemicals.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.249 align:middle line:84%
When people are in
love, they glow.

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:51.048 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> They're healthy.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:90%
They have so much energy.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, how?

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.164 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they get that from?

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
The culture medium, OK?

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.961 align:middle line:84%
If I say, look, same
person, opens her eyes,

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
instead of seeing
someone they love,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
they see something
that scares them.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I say, do you release these
same chemicals in love?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, no,
when I perceive

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
the world as threatening,
were I living in fear,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I release stress hormones.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I release
hormones that control

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
my immune system,
inflammatory agents,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
these things that get me
ready for fight or flight.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, here's
the interesting part.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the fate of the
cells is based on the chemistry.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If I take the chemicals
released by the brain in love

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and put into a plastic
dish with cells,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:90%
the cells grow beautifully.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.737 align:middle line:90%
And I say, OK, wait.

00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
What about the
chemicals that come out

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
of our brain of someone in fear?

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I take those chemicals.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Put that in the culture dish.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.915 align:middle line:90%
The cells stop growing.

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:41.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And they get into protection.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Protections close yourself down.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is this.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.154 align:middle line:84%
When you're in growth,
you're open to the world.

00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And you say, come
on, bring it on.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But when fear or
something comes in there,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
you close it down.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And the chemistry of the fear
is what shuts down the cells.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Fear kills, basically,
is what it's all about.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So basically, it says this.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:90%
We always talk about mind body.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And those strict
fundamental scientists go,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, mind body, what's
that, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And I go, it's not a mystery.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The mind is an
interpretation of the world.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It causes the brain
to release chemistry

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that matches the interpretation
to coordinate 50 trillion cells

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to live in that world.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
It's your emotions.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:90%
It's your perceptions.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:90%
It's your beliefs.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
These are the sources
of the chemicals that

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:90%
end up controlling the genes.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is a new science
that's called epigenetics,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.896 align:middle line:84%
because epigenetics
is a revolution of all

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of our understanding of science
for a very simple reason.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
When I was a professor
in a medical school,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
we were teaching the
concept of genetics.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And genetics, most everybody
knows, yes, we have genes,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and the genes control
our traits and that we

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
get the genes from our parents.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.554 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, the traits
that are running in our family

00:08:51.554 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
are passed down to us.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's a good thing,
and sometimes it's a bad thing.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got diseases
in your family.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Last thing you want to know,
oh, geez, everybody in my family

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
got cancer.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, am I
going to be next?

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got the genes.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
So that's our belief system
that we've been teaching,

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
that genes control us.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
That makes us
victims, as I said,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't pick the
genes as far as we know.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:90%
We can't change the genes.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they
are, they make us.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so people walk around going,
oh, my life is not so good.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I got these genes.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:90%
"Epi" means above.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I say
epigenetic control,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally saying
"control above the genes."

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment
that controls it.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.492 align:middle line:84%
Well, that includes not
just the real environment

00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:32.074 align:middle line:84%
but our perception
of the environment.

00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you could live in the
healthiest of environments,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
but if you perceive it to
be a threatening world,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
then your cells
receive the perception.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't read
the direct world.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
In genetic control,
you're a victim,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
because the genes control you.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is as a revolution
because it says, look,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
if the environment or my
perception controls genes,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that can
change my perception.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that can
change my environment.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
I'm not locked in.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I am free to change
the way I live

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
in the world, which in
turn comes back and changes

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:90%
the genetic readout.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what's
so profoundly important.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot of people
talk about the placebo effect.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.841 align:middle line:84%
>> And they say, well,
what's the placebo effect?

00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this pill is
going to cure you.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest new
science in the world.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.672 align:middle line:84%
And I take the pill,
and I get better.

00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell me it
was just a sugar pill.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So then the truth is,
well, what healed me?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't the sugar pill.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It was the belief in the pill.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So everyone says, oh,
yeah, placebo effect,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.955 align:middle line:84%
that's how you have
this wonderful thought,

00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:32.755 align:middle line:90%
and you get better.

00:10:32.755 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, but
here's the problem.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We've only talked about
the placebo effect.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There's another thing
called the nocebo effect.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
The nocebo effect is,
what is the consequence

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%
of a negative thought?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out it's equally
powerful in controlling

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.735 align:middle line:84%
your biology and your
genetics as a placebo,

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:90%
a positive thought.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about, oh, yeah,
placebo, good thoughts

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
create good health
and good life.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, yeah, and a bad
thought, a negative thought,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
a nocebo effect, can
actually kill you.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:90%
It can cause a disease.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
you're going to get

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
this cancer because
everyone says

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get this cancer,
and then your perception is

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
sending cancer thoughts
into your body,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry that
comes from the thoughts

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
to the brain to the
body is a chemistry

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't support
health but will actually

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
lead to your own death.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
it's the power

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:84%
of your perceptions,
positive or negative,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:90%
that overrides your genetics.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is most amazing,
because all of a sudden,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:90%
you look around.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And you say, but look at all
those wonderful happy people.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:90%
They're not only just happy.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
They're also healthy.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And the fact is, yes, they're
sending in a chemistry that

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the cells will
really thrive with.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is how we should be.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's our
intention, isn't it?

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we want.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But then we've been programmed
to believe other people's

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:90%
stories about us.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is especially true in
the conventional medical world.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.315 align:middle line:90%
You're a child.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:57.565 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about health?

00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
When you're not
well, the parents

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
say, look, you got
to go to the doctor.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Daddy is sick.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.305 align:middle line:84%
He has to go to the
doctor, et cetera.

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Why is that relevant?

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Because as a child,
we are learning.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What are we learning?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
If I am sick, it's not me
that takes care of my health

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I go to this person
called the doctor.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
what I've done

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
is I've given power
over my health

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:90%
to the opinion of the doctor.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I buy the opinion
of the doctor's truth,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
he's the one that knows.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And he says I'm going to die.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that says
I have this illness,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to have
all these problems.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Then I take his
belief, not my belief.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:90%
That becomes my perception.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I take his statement, turn
it into chemistry in my head,

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and manifest what he said.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So I gave away my
power to what I

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
thought was the professional
who knows better.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctor's orders,
that kind of stuff.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're turning
to we're beginning

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.095 align:middle line:84%
to find out a very
interesting thing is

00:12:53.095 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that in the conventional
Western world right now,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
the AMA gave us what they call
conservative data about what

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is called iatrogenic illness,
which is illness related

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%
to medical treatment.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Iatrogenic illness means as I
go to the doctor with problem A,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I get a treatment.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I get sick or die from
problem B, which is actually

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:90%
the result of the treatment.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's the treatment
that caused the problem.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The American Medical
Association published a paper

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that the data they
gave put them that they

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.757 align:middle line:84%
were the third leading cause
of death in the United States.

00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
There are other
people that say, wait,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
the AMA's data is based on
conservative suggestions,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:90%
more or less, not the real data.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So they said, give
us the real data.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they actually went
down and actually selected

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and collected all the data about
how medical involvement has

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
been deleterious, it turns
out that medicine has then

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
become the leading cause of
death in the United States

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what it
really comes down to

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
is an understanding
that they were still

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:90%
locked under genetic control.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're treating you as an
automaton, a robot, your genes.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:90%
You're sick.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's your genes at the
center of the problem.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And the new biology says,
no, you're the one that controls

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:90%
your genes.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And so you can even
have a mutant gene,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
but with a proper vision and
understanding of the world

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
or an openness to the
world, you can actually

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.904 align:middle line:84%
cover up the deleterious
effects of a mutant gene.

00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
it's like, no,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
we're not controlled
by the genes.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We're controlled by the way
we respond to the world.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people say, it's
probably safer to walk across

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the motorway with a blindfold
on than to go to the doctor.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Bruce, the subconscious
mind, we know it's been proven

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:40.466 align:middle line:90%
in different areas.

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a million times stronger
than our conscious thoughts

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%
or our conscious mind.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It's running like
90%, 95%, if not more,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.675 align:middle line:90%
of our everyday activities.

00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:50.675 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these programs
in our subconscious mind

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
are from our childhood
that maybe not necessarily

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
serving our life well.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to reprogram
our subconscious mind?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there some tools or
some good quick places

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:90%
where people can go?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.085 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important things,

00:15:02.085 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious
mind really has

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
fundamental programs
of life that we acquire

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
from our parents, our
family, our community

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
between the last
trimester of pregnancy

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and the first seven years.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is why nature
created the first seven

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:84%
years of a child's
life to download

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:84%
how to be a member of a family
and a society and a culture

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.439 align:middle line:84%
by strictly observing
other people.

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a brain function.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's equivalent of hypnosis.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the fundamental
programs in your subconscious

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
are not yours.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:90%
The conscious mind is yours.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the creative mind.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the issue is
that the conscious mind

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.512 align:middle line:90%
can travel in time.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing next week?

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Your mind let's go of the
moment, goes to next week.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.585 align:middle line:90%
What'd you do last week?

00:15:43.585 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It lets go of the moment,
and you move into last week.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Or I say, Ty, think of
something in your head.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you're thinking,
you're not paying attention.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what the function
of the subconscious comes in.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:84%
When you're not paying
attention, you go to autopilot.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you're
walking down the street,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and you have a thought
and stop like that.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.427 align:middle line:90%
No, you continue walking.

00:16:03.427 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you're not
paying attention.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a subconscious that
does all the jobs from walking

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:90%
to driving the car.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And so why is this relevant?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
not paying attention,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.657 align:middle line:84%
and we default in
the subconscious,

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:84%
we play the programs that
are in the subconscious.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but the
programs in the subconscious

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:90%
are primarily not yours.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:90%
They came from other people.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And most of them, as
psychologists tell us,

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
most of the programs we get are
disempowering, self-sabotaging,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and limiting.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And the relevance
about that is this.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to play those
programs, then by definition,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be shooting
myself in the foot.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you play
the subconscious programs

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.671 align:middle line:84%
is because the conscious mind
is engaged with thinking, which

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:90%
is 95% of the time or more.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that means 95% of your
behavior is invisible to you.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And why I really
want to emphasize

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:90%
this so much is this--

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:90%
because we believe were victims.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I really wanted
to be successful.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be healthy.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a
great relationship,

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's not working out.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And they say, well,
that was my intention,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.209 align:middle line:90%
and it's not working.

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
world's against me.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.695 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into victims,
like god, I really wanted it,

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
people to wake up,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.286 align:middle line:90%
because it basically is this.

00:17:13.286 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
It's not the world
against you at all.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The world will give
you everything.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The issue is you're
not operating

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
from your conscious mind
except 5% at the most.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And so your life is really a
reflection of your subconscious

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you say to me, well, I
got programmed from the last

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
trimester of pregnancy
to first seven years,

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.546 align:middle line:84%
so I was being programmed when
I was one and two and three.

00:17:33.546 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And I go, absolutely.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And you say, but what
were the programs?

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.546 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what the
hell the programs are.

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And I go, here's the neat part.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
95% of your life is coming
from the subconscious.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.127 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do
is look at your life.

00:17:50.127 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And just look at it.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.876 align:middle line:90%
And you say, for what?

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what comes
to you that you want,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and it comes to you easily.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You have programs to
allow that to happen.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But what you struggle with,
what you work hard on, what

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to put a
lot of effort into,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:90%
why are you working so hard?

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is simple.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you have an
invisible program

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that is sabotaging
you from that point.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, all of a
sudden, you say, well,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.241 align:middle line:90%
what do I need to change?

00:18:13.241 --> 00:18:14.607 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, look at your life.

00:18:14.607 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And tell me what you're
having trouble with.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's the direct
expression of a program

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:90%
that's not supporting you.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.428 align:middle line:84%
There's always been a
belief that the conscious

00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious minds
are one and the same.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So if I educate
my conscious mind,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.666 align:middle line:84%
then my subconscious
mind should automatically

00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
know what the heck
I just did, right?

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well,
yeah, guess what?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
How many self-help
books did you read?

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh, I read
all these self-help books.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I say, now that you read
them, did your life change?

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
no, not really.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really
smart, because if you

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
ask me any questions
about the self-help book,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I can answer it.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, what's the issue?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
And the issue is this.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
The conscious mind is creative.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I could read the book.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I could watch this
video with you in it.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I could even just go, a-ha,
and the conscious mind

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:90%
could accept that and learn it.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious mind
does not learn that way.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And that has been the problem.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Because we educate.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind's
getting really smart.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And our life stays
exactly the same as it is.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And the issue is why?

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
translate from the conscious

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.905 align:middle line:84%
to the subconscious,
because the subconscious

00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
learns in, well, three
to four fundamental ways.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the first way
it learned seven years

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
was hypnosis,
because the brain was

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
operating in a low
vibrational frequency

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and just downloading
what it saw.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
After you're seven,
how do you learn?

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Habituation.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
How did you learn the
ABCs or the times table?

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
You had to repeat it and
repeat it and repeat it.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And finally, you got it.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And then you know how to do it.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:90%
You want to drive a car?

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice
and practice,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and then you learn how to do it.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to change
the subconscious mind,

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis is number one.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.057 align:middle line:84%
Number two, repetition,
habituation, create a habit.

00:19:45.057 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it
seems like a struggle

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's new to
the subconscious mind.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But hey, you didn't learn ABCD
the first time you said it.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You had to do
it again and again.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But after you do it for
a repetition period,

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
it will be so natural that
if you're not doing it,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious mind will
go, hey, what's happening?

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing it.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's really good.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:90%
We overcome that.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
A third way-- which
is some people get it,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's very powerful, but
I wouldn't recommend it--

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous emotional shock.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Something happens to your
life, and it's so dramatic

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.444 align:middle line:84%
that after that
moment, you're not

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:90%
going to be the same person.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious got
it right there, OK?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the newer one
and the better one

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.229 align:middle line:84%
is a whole new field of
belief change modalities,

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
which are also
associated with what's

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
called energy psychology.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are wonderful,
because basically,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.759 align:middle line:90%
it's a form of super learning.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And what's neat about it,
the conventional things

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
like hypnosis or
habituation, there's

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
a time element that
takes a long time.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But these new beliefs
change modalities,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
like a super
learning experience,

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you can change a belief you've
had your whole life, 50 years,

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
and change it in 10 minutes.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really a new type
of psychology that's coming in.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's really necessary,
because as they say,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
necessity is the
mother of invention.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.935 align:middle line:84%
>> We're running into a world
that has a lot of necessity

00:21:05.935 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to change very, very quickly.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're really happy
to see that there

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
are ways of changing without
going through all that anxiety

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.694 align:middle line:84%
and stress, and we can
do it really quickly.

00:21:14.694 --> 00:21:16.734 align:middle line:84%
My favorite one is the
one that I use because I'm

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
most familiar with it.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:90%
But there's many of them.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
In my books, I
give a whole list.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But the one I use
is called Psych-K,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
like the abbreviation
of psychology.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It actually represents
psychological kinesiology.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's an exercise
where you get

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
your right and your
left brain hemispheres

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.355 align:middle line:84%
to work in harmony,
which they don't do

00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:34.772 align:middle line:90%
on a normal day-by-day basis.

00:21:34.772 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you get them
to work in harmony,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that's called brain
synchronization.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:90%
A window opens up.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can drop in a new
belief in five minutes.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm a devotee of that,
because I wouldn't have written

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:90%
my book.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.561 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't write my book.

00:21:48.561 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I tried for 15 years
to write the book.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And every time I'd get
halfway through the book,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
it would peter out.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize it because
my subconscious had a fear.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- at the time, was
a respected scientist.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you
write this book,

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and you bring in consciousness
and spirit into the book,

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.284 align:middle line:84%
all your colleagues
are going to shun you.

00:22:08.284 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So my subconscious
was doing me a favor.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It says, you don't
want to do this,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because this will
invalidate you.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like kill you.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So my subconscious programming,
working 95% of the day,

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:90%
would sabotage the writing.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
What I ended up doing was
changing the belief about that.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%
And then the book came out.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It was just like--

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:90%
it just flowed right out.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Within a few months, the
whole thing was really done.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you say, well, what if
you can release these programs?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story of
"The Matrix," where I say,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
well, I take the red pill.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I get out of the program.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.214 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, yeah, but in
real life, every time we've

00:22:43.214 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
taken that red
pill, I say, what's

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:90%
the red pill in real life?

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.631 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
falling in love.

00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Falling in love
with either a person

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
or falling in love
with your creativity

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, falling in
love, because when you fall

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in love, what you're doing
is so captivating and so

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
engrossing and so desirable, you
don't let your conscious mind

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:90%
wander.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.115 align:middle line:84%
So the first time in your
life, your conscious mind

00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
is staying present.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, why
is that important?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.502 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind, wishes,
desires, and aspirations--

00:23:10.502 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
if you're operating
from that mind,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you manifest your
wishes and desires.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So my conclusion for
all of this blah,

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah that I'm
giving you is simply this.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
What if you go into
the subconscious mind

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and change the programs
in the subconscious mind

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
so they reflect the wishes and
desires of your conscious mind?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.087 align:middle line:90%
What would that mean?

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you what it means.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll live in a honeymoon
for every day of your life

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.939 align:middle line:84%
on this planet for
a simple reason.

00:23:36.939 --> 00:23:37.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:37.738 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If my conscious mind with
wishes and desires begins

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to wander, and I default
into the subconscious,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's playing my
wishes and desires,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.412 align:middle line:90%
I never left the honeymoon.

00:23:46.412 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And following
on in the Psych-K,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
you were saying something
about a gentleman who gets up

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
on stage and actually proves
it with watching the actual

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
frequencies change
in the mind, right?

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, absolutely, because a
lot of people beforehand would

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:58.106 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, that's
just a new age idea.

00:23:58.106 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
know you've really

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
changed just because you
got finished with the belief

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, I
feel so much better.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that real?

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, now Jeff Fannin, a
neuroscientist whose expertise

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is called brain mapping, and he
puts wires all over your head

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and can read three dimensionally
what's going on in the brain.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
The moment the
brain has changed--

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.760 align:middle line:90%
the program has changed--

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:90%
you can see it on the screen.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So he generally puts a
person up on the stage

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.471 align:middle line:84%
and puts the wires on and says,
OK, now we tested your belief.

00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
a belief in this.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Now let's put in the new belief.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because the audience

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
can see the change before
the person actually

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:90%
says, yes, now it's done.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe a few seconds,
but the audience can see it.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So why is this important?

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.647 align:middle line:84%
Because this sounds
miraculous, yes.

00:24:43.647 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
You mean you can change your
beliefs in 5 or 10 minutes?

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And see the
results in an instant.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> But you can see it instantly.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you can
experience instantly

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
if it's a phobia,
for a simple reason.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Because a phobia is a certain
stimulus, like height,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
or I'm afraid of spiders,
or I'm afraid of dogs.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, good, let's
go through the belief change.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:90%
You come out.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, am
I afraid of spiders?

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And I can show you instantly.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Here's a spider.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, 10 minutes
before, it freaks you out.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now it's like, oh,
all of a sudden,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:90%
your complete biology changed.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:90%
So you can see that.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But a lot of people's beliefs
involve something dynamic.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They have to do
with relationship

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to others and people or jobs.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:90%
So they actually have to go out.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they look
back and go, whoa,

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
this is so different
than it was before.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Most people's stresses are
not real immediate emergency

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:90%
stresses at all.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.646 align:middle line:84%
They're beliefs of a fear that
they won't have something,

00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:90%
that they won't have a job.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:90%
They won't have food.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
They won't have a friend.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that they
don't have them right now.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.546 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking about,
oh, if that happens,

00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
stress comes from.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why 90% of
the people are in fear,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
because they recognize that
their future is uncertain.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But rather than seeing
it in a positive way,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.325 align:middle line:84%
they have this
image of a negative.

00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Trying to work
it all out and get--

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's really interesting
because, remember when you fall

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
in love, and you get
out of the programming,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.765 align:middle line:90%
you create heaven on Earth.

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it wasn't
for the programming,

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
everybody would have
heaven on Earth.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we can change
the programming,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
then heaven on Earth
is available to anyone.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.234 align:middle line:84%
If you take a tuning fork,
you have two tuning forks,

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're tuned to
the same frequency.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:90%
You hit one tuning fork.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
The other one vibrates as well,
because the vibration from one

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.189 align:middle line:84%
is the same resonance
harmony of the other one.

00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that's called
the harmonic resonance

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
when two things vibrate at the
same vibration of frequency.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
interesting about that is

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
the brain takes in data,
but the other thing

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
know is the brain

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
is broadcasting
that data back out.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh, yeah, I can
put wires on your head

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and read your brain activity.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah,
people, well, that's

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
just a connection to the skin.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a new way
of reading brains.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The one with wires is called
electroencephalograph, electric

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:90%
reading of the brain.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
The new one is called
magnetoencephalograph,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:84%
so it's reading the magnetic
fields generated by the brain.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:90%
But here's what's critical.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The probe isn't even
touching the head.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:90%
The probe is out here.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the point?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:90%
The point is this.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is a tuning fork.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
If I send out a bad
vibration, a bad vibe,

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.652 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to resonate with
anything that's good out there.

00:27:23.652 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
If there's something
out there that

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
has the same vibration as
the bad vibe, which is really

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
the image of bad
vibe, it will cause

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that to move, just like
two tuning forks, right?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So interesting point,
what comes into my life comes

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
into my life not by accident
but through harmonic resonance.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
What I'm sending out,
I will bring back in.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm afraid,
then guess what?

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I find reasons to be afraid.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:84%
They find me,
actually, because I'm

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:90%
broadcasting that frequency.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So then you say, well,
what's the resolution?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
you're the one that's

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
broadcasting the frequency.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Recognizing them in a moment
of fear and go, wait, stop.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.164 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that can push
the stop button and say,

00:28:03.164 --> 00:28:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather think of
something different.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you do, it's
the most fabulous thing

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
in the world, because now
you're the one that says,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a victim of these things
that I was attributing to other

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one that's creating it.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.481 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're the
one that's creating it,

00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
then you're the one that can
change the creation to anything

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:90%
you really want.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Go out there and love
the world, and it

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:90%
will feed you all this stuff.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is the nature
of heaven is to, what,

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
go out and experience
this planet.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so cool, Bruce.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.127 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:28:36.127 --> 00:28:37.081 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Ty.

00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:39.153 align:middle line:84%
>> You're such a
cool human being.

00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Aw, you have blessed work.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
All right, folks,
we've run out of time.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton has given us so
much beautiful information.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So much stuff has
passed through us.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
We've got these two wonderful
books, "The Biology of Belief"

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and "The Honeymoon Effect."

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:84%
If you read these books and
make them become part of you,

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
do the work on your
subconscious mind.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Get the negative energy out
of you, out of your body.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And really, you got to
think about it all the time.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, and you
really commit to it, folks,

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.849 align:middle line:84%
you can be, do, and
have anything you want.

00:29:08.849 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
You can be so much
more than you are,

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can have love and that
honeymoon effect in your life

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe in you.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Bruce believes in you.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:90%
[KISSES] Thanks for tuning in.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.693 align:middle line:90%
See you later, guys.

00:29:19.693 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.
