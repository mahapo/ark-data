00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, folks.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.124 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know what
you're thinking.

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:40.092 align:middle line:84%
What is Ty doing with
a sports coat on?

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually winter
and I'm a little bit cold.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
But forget about that.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We have another amazing
man on the show--

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.899 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Dain Heer.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
giving you some time.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.195 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Another amazing human being
who's doing his best to elevate

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness and the
vibration of the planet.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:10%
Access Consciousness--
I suppose there's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people out
there who may not

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.113 align:middle line:10%
be familiar with the term.

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you bring us up to speed
on what it actually is?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.614 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Access Consciousness
is basically a set of tools,

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:10%
techniques, information, ways of
looking at the world that allow

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:10%
you to change anything
you've ever wanted to change.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:90%
And it can be in your body.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.687 align:middle line:84%
It can be in your
emotional health.

00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It can be in your mental health.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It can be in your relationships,
your sex life, your money

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And literally anything
you want to change.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on the idea
that consciousness includes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:90%
everything and judges nothing.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
who used to sort of talk

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:90%
about spirituality.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're talking
about consciousness,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:84%
but they don't actually
have a definition of it.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Our definition of it is
where everything exists,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and nothing is judged.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you never had to
judge anything or anyone

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and you could undo all
the judgments you've ever

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
had in the past, your life would
become this miraculous place.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Talking about judgments,
is judgment something that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.884 align:middle line:90%
energetically holds us down?

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the thing is, see,
judgment is one of the biggest

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.105 align:middle line:90%
killers there is.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you look at it,
you can either have judgment

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
or you can have gratitude.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And we can't help ourselves.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.218 align:middle line:84%
We just do it
automatically all day long.

00:02:04.218 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well-- and that's
the thing is we--

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> We can't.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.105 align:middle line:84%
>> --don't know that
we can help ourselves.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:08.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But once we realize we can,
we can start changing this sort

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of tidal wave of yuck that's
been in our lives in whatever

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
area it's been and actually
start creating possibilities

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is, judgment
is sort of the biggest killer.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can either
have judgment or gratitude.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:90%
You can have judgment or love.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.789 align:middle line:90%
You can have judgment or joy.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.246 align:middle line:84%
You can have judgment
or happiness.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You can have judgment
of wrongness.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Or you can have the joy of
knowing that there's actually

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with you.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what ends up happening
is if you can ask yourself,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:90%
hey, you know what?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.314 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have any judgment
of this person or this thing,

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
how would it look
different to me?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.387 align:middle line:84%
How would it feel
different to me?

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of been picking
up everybody else's judgments

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
around us about what's
right, about what's wrong,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
about who people are, about
how they are, about how we are,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and how we can and cannot be.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And we've adopted all these
points of view energetically.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.254 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really have
very much to do with us.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to ask
ourselves, you know what?

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
What's my point of
view in this situation?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And if I had no judgment in this
situation, what could I choose?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you start by
asking questions--

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
see a question always empowers.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.352 align:middle line:90%
An answer disempowers.

00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything we're willing
to ask a question about,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:84%
we can have a different
possibility with.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you start
asking those questions

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.929 align:middle line:90%
that we just talked about.

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there are a few others
that if you start instituting

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.928 align:middle line:84%
them, what they do
is they take you

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:90%
out of the judgment of things.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.324 align:middle line:84%
So a question such as, how does
it get any better than this?

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:10%
You want to ask it when
something good happens

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:10%
or when something bad happens?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.576 align:middle line:10%
In a bad situation,
it'll make it better.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
In a good situation
it'll make it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.269 align:middle line:90%
even better than it just got.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
found in Access Consciousness

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
is that 98% of your
thoughts, your feelings,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and your emotions don't
actually belong to you.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
You literally pick them up like
a big psychic radio receiver.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been
around somebody who's sad,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
do you notice how
you start to feel sad

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know why?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.643 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're thinking,
wait a minute.

00:03:52.643 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the sad one
here, except that's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
got such an intense resonance
to it that we end up

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
vibrating like that.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of like tuning
forks to other people.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.277 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a clearing
statement you call POD and POC.

00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about how

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that clears negative
energy out of our bodies

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
or if that's, in
fact, what it does?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Basically, it's like this.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Our judgments and our
points of view that we use,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.099 align:middle line:84%
that we stick in place are the
things that end of sticking us.

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
The way I put it is this.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Your point of view
creates your reality.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.797 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't create
your point of view.

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can have two
totally different people

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
who respond to the
same situation in two

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
totally different ways.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.324 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get two
totally different outcomes

00:04:33.324 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
as a result of it.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.956 align:middle line:84%
What this does is when you're in
a place where you feel like you

00:04:36.956 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
don't have a
different choice, you

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
can use this to actually
create a different choice.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:10%
The short form for
it is POC and POD,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.614 align:middle line:10%
which stands for going back
to the point of creation

00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:10%
or wherever you locked this
limited point of view in place

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.682 align:middle line:10%
and think there's no other
choice and undoing it.

00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And literally, you're asking
the consciousness of you

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.877 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness of you
actually knows where it is.

00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
So here's the thing.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So this POC and
POD is-- literally,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
you can use it to change
any area of your life.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it's short
form for a very somewhat

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
long clearing statement,
which is right and wrong,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, POD and POC, or
POC and POD, All 9, Shorts,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.947 align:middle line:90%
Boys, and Beyonds.

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
use the whole thing.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what all of that
whole thing is designed to do

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
is to take every piece of a
limitation that we now have

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and undo it.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Basically, dismantle
the limitation.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And so with this POC and POD
thing, what you want to do

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
is you can do something like
ask a question like, hey,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
everything that
doesn't allow me to be

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:90%
as joyful as I can be today--

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to now let that go.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.207 align:middle line:84%
And you go, OK, POC
and POD it, which

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
means go back to the point
of creation of whatever

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
is creating you not being
as joyful as you are

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Or POD, which is the
point of destruction.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in order
to create any limitation,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
we've either got to have a
germinal point of that creation

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:90%
of that limitation.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Or we destroy something
that's a possibility

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and put limitation in
its place by buying

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
a more limited point of
view than we actually

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:90%
have as beings.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like it's
a modality that where

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:90%
you're giving people--

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:90%
here's the tools.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Go empower yourself.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't need me.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't need anything else.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You just need to start asking
yourself the right questions,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and be open, and be
open minded about it.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And watch the
miracles that occur

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Dain, I know you've written
that the truth will make us

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
feel instantly lighter.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that a lie actually
holds us down and gives us

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.729 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a heavy feeling.

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate on that
sensation a little bit?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's
this-- truly, what

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is true for you will always
make you feel lighter.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.785 align:middle line:84%
What's not will always
make you feel heavier.

00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And the thing you
want to realize

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is what's true for you may
not be true for anybody else.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So you might be in a
room full of 50 people.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And somebody presents a piece
of information and says,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:90%
hey, we can really change this.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And 35 of those people
are like, yes, we can.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And 15 are like, uh-uh.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because for the
15, it's not true for them.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.709 align:middle line:90%
For the 35, it actually is.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And the difficulty
is what we've done

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
is we've spent so
much of our lives

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
trying to make what feels
heavy to us somehow come

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
to some sense of lightness,
rather than going,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.635 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's just not true for me.

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, listen, so
talking about relationships

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and caring--

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.235 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure-- yeah, whenever
we get someone on the show with

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
such great insight,
we always wonder, hey,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.404 align:middle line:84%
what's the secret
to relationships?

00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Can we attract a better
partner into our life?

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Or can we improve on the
love that we're experiencing

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:90%
with our current partner?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is a big one.

00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:90%
But basically, it's like this.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.296 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have been looking
for the, quote unquote,

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:90%
"love of our lives."

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And what that entails is
so many points of view

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
about what they should be,
and who they should be,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
and who we have to be.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we have so much judgment
of us, that we think no one

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
would love us.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And really what it
entails is getting out

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.412 align:middle line:84%
of the judgment of us
and the other person.

00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love the
person you're with,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.869 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have total
gratitude for them

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.789 align:middle line:84%
exactly as they
are, it's not going

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
to be something that's working.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you're always
going to be putting energy

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:90%
into trying to change them.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
be with is somebody

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that you love and adore and
have total gratitude exactly

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:90%
as they are right now.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So my suggestion is
write down everything

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to have in a partner
and everything you would not

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:90%
like to have in a partner.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And then ask the universe
to allow it to show up.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is if you write down

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
just the list of everything
you desire, you'll get it.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But you'll get this entire
other list of things

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:90%
that don't really work for you.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But you won't be able to
see it until it's too late.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so obviously, we're
hoping everyone is going to tap

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:90%
into the book.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there any little
cutting-edge bits

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom that you've
come across lately

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
that you'd be willing
to share with us, Dain?

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the big things that
I found is we talked earlier

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:84%
about 98% of your
thoughts, feelings,

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
and emotions don't
belong to you.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
things that I found

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is that what most
people have done

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
their entire lives
is actually mimic

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
their friends, their
parents, their family,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
and all the people around them.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it's actually something
called biomimetic mimicry.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.599 align:middle line:84%
Biomimetic-- it's like
now what science is doing.

00:08:57.599 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like if they want to
build a better airplane wing,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
they study how a bird's
wing actually works.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they mimic it to
the best of their ability.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've done the same
thing with everything

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
we didn't understand with our
parents, with our friends,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
with our relationships,
with our lovers,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
with everybody who's
ever been in our life

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't get
what they were doing.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We literally would
mimic it energetically

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and try to somehow in
that way understand it.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I've
asked people to do is ask.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
When they feel like they're
around somebody and not

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
being them, just say, how
much biomimetic mimicry

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:90%
am I doing here?

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.694 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can POC and
POD it, basically.

00:09:35.694 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
I suggest people do.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
People who have this tool sort
of have an edge up in a sense.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.864 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
do is you go, OK,

00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
am I willing to let this go?

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, POC and POD it all.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And literally, you'll notice.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to
realize that you start

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to have a greater sense
of lightness, a greater

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
sense of joy, a greater
sense of possibilities.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start to
go, wait a minute.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.527 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been mimicking
the people I work with.

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been mimicking the people
I'm in relationship with.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been mimicking the
people I'm in love with.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been mimicking the
people that were my family.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
reasons why so many people--

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.872 align:middle line:84%
they get to midlife, where the
supposed midlife crisis idea.

00:10:13.872 --> 00:10:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is
they get to this point.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
They realize my life has
nothing to do with me.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been living for
everybody else around me.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And in essence,
what really creates

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that is this mimicry
that we've learned to do

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:90%
since we were little kids.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.986 align:middle line:84%
So anybody you think
about, anyway in which

00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
you're around somebody and
you feel like you're not

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
being you anymore, you want to
go all the biomimetic mimicry

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
or BMM for short.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
All the BMM.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:90%
POC and POD all that.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:10%
Literally, if you
ask, who does this

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:10%
belong to, to every
thought, every feeling,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.374 align:middle line:10%
every judgment, every heaviness
you have for three days?

00:10:46.374 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
At the end of three
days you walk around

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.499 align:middle line:84%
like you're in a walking,
talking meditation.

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:52.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, man.

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:54.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's the book, folks--

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
"Being You Changing the World."

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
If you've just
tuned in, you just

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
see we've just had some amazing
insights directly from Dain.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that's probably
got your curiosity spiked.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.494 align:middle line:84%
Get the book and
empower yourselves.

00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm guaranteeing
there's going to be

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.534 align:middle line:90%
a million little tools in here.

00:11:10.534 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can start asking
yourself the right questions

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and start clearing
yourself up energetically

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and literally
empowering yourself.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:90%
You have the power.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Don't be looking
outside for all this--

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:90%
No, it's you.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.221 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
like this man here

00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:90%
who just say, look, here it is.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Go use it, and empower yourself,
and build up your momentum,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.616 align:middle line:90%
and be everything you can be.

00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for tuning in, guys.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.
