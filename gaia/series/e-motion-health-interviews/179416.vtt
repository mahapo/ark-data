00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:90%
This is Ty.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.357 align:middle line:84%
We have been brought out
here to an amazing location.

00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little bit of
rain, but it's just so serene.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a real magic spot.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
If you look around
the background,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.304 align:middle line:84%
it's just a real
special place to be.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
real special topic

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.303 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk about
today, and it's called fasting.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Fasting is basically
going without food.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
giving your body a break.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about not
eating food, and letting

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:90%
your body heal itself.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I am 150% convinced that
every single disease

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.044 align:middle line:84%
and every ailment in your body
is from overeating and eating

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:90%
too much of the wrong foods.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it
starts to build mucus

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.587 align:middle line:84%
and the cell
communication breaks down,

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you're
sick and you don't know why.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell
you that fasting is

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
unbelievable ways

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that you can transform
any disease, any problem.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Like there's been guys that
have done 90 day fasts--

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
under supervision, 90
days, no food, no nothing--

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and they've healed
themselves with bone disease,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.296 align:middle line:84%
anything degenerative like
eyesight or hearing loss.

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And these are guys
like 70 years of age

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
have healed like five or
six ailments in one fast.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's an extreme case.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do that.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.288 align:middle line:84%
But what we need to do
is we need to understand

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:90%
a few things, guys.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.525 align:middle line:90%
As soon as you stop eating--

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
like for instance, when
you wake up in the morning,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.669 align:middle line:84%
maybe you've had a light
meal the night before.

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You wake up in the
morning, use the toilet.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You use the toilet
and you'll notice

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.914 align:middle line:84%
that your urine is really sort
of yellow and really smelly.

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because
your body overnight

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
in the early hours in the
morning has started to detox.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got no
digestion going on.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So all the energy that's
always constantly going

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
around inside of you
that you're unaware of,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
going to digestion

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.014 align:middle line:84%
is now getting toxins out of
the tissues, out of the bone,

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:90%
out of the ligaments.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:84%
It's putting them into
your urinal canal,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up in the morning,
you're dumping them out.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
When you get sick, like really
sick, like a cold or a flu,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
you know how you
lose your appetite?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That's mother nature saying,
stop, just let me fix you.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Just stop eating.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You watch a lion,
you watch a dog,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.527 align:middle line:84%
someone-- a dog or
an animal gets sick

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
or they get an injury,
the first thing to do

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
is go crawl away into some
nice little quiet spot,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.025 align:middle line:84%
and they stop eating
and they stop drinking.

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And in a three, four day, maybe
it's a week, a week and a half,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
they heal themselves
naturally, and that's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
what our bodies want
to do too, guys.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it, trust me.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
As soon as your body
has no digestion going

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
on at all, the energy
that's constantly

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
flowing around your body,
it then goes to detoxing.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is your liver

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
has basically put-- all this
stuff, all this mucus creates

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
toxins, and then
stows the toxins away

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.185 align:middle line:84%
in your bones and
your ligaments,

00:02:58.185 --> 00:02:59.935 align:middle line:84%
anywhere where it's
not in your blood were

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:90%
it's not poisoning yourself.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
This is going on
constantly inside

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
without you being aware of it.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
stop digesting,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
all that energy goes
back, it gets those toxins

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
in those deep dark places.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It puts them back
into your bloodstream,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and you get them out.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
You get them out
through your tongue,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
you get them out
through dandruff,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
you get them out
through your skin,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
you get it out
through your feces,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.946 align:middle line:84%
you get it out through your
urinal canal, and you'll know.

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:22.766 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting yourself
under nature's operating table.

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get a
little bit discouraged.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever gone a
couple of days without food,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
they think it's like
starving yourself.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Or they get a sensation of they
wake up and all of a sudden

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
they're dizzy and they
feel absolutely terrible.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
What's actually happening
is your liver is overloaded.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.889 align:middle line:84%
Because you've stopped
eating, all this energy

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that's normally
digesting food is now

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.002 align:middle line:90%
going to eliminating toxins.

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And when your liver gets
overloaded, all of a sudden,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
it's in your bloodstream,
it's going through your brain,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.284 align:middle line:90%
you feel absolutely terrible.

00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And you go and eat,
and you feel better.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
You go, ooh, I'm never
doing that again,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.233 align:middle line:84%
but you don't realize
you were just so

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:90%
close to having a breakthrough.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Guys, you know, when
you have a fast, yeah,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel not so
good for a couple of days,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
but the end result,
you can actually

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
start feeling good every
day and your energy levels

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:90%
get consistent.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
You sleep better.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You have more clarity, because
your blood slowly but surely

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.680 align:middle line:90%
begins to purify.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.159 align:middle line:90%
This is not a quick fix.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to the pharmacy
and getting some drugs, guys.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you a secret of
how do you really heal yourself

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%
on the cellular level.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
You could go from having this
diet of all this complex foods

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.105 align:middle line:84%
and mixing all
this food together,

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're kind of stressed
and you're not sleeping well,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and you you're not functioning
the best and you're

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
having problems in all
different areas of your life,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and start looking at
fasting and stuff.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you have this clarity.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like your former life
is like a blur to you.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.434 align:middle line:84%
Once you get all that stuff
and all the mucus out,

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
your energy starts
flowing through

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and your blood purifies.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.341 align:middle line:90%
It's like the blood goes into--

00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
it's going into your
brain is more purified.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And your thoughts are
better and you're clearer,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
and it really is amazing.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%

You can start to look better.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes will be white.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.649 align:middle line:90%
Your skin will start to glow.

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Your hair, all of
a sudden, you won't

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:90%
be getting gray hair anymore.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:90%

It's not going to
happen overnight,

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
but it will if you just
stick with it, guys.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It is such an amazing process.
