00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, folks.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to do
the bedtime qi gong.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
This would be done right before
you go to sleep, literally

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of your bed.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And as T.J. is
going to explain it,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
it'll be a way of gathering all
the thoughts and all the mind

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
racing and all the stuff,
condensing it, boom.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.897 align:middle line:84%
And I'll let T.J.
run us through it.

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But it'll just be a way
of putting that all to bed

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and getting the best night's
sleep that you can possibly

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, T.J., let's do it.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So exactly, the
bedtime qi gong starts

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
by sitting on the
side of the bed,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
going into your sleep space.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's important that you
use your sleep space just

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
for sleeping.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't do your work,
don't do your homework,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.014 align:middle line:84%
don't do your processing
in your sleep space.

00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Your sleep space is
just for sleeping.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So you go into your
sleep space, and you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:90%
sit on the side of the bed.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And you just think
about all the activities

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
you've done in the day, all the
projects that are not finished,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
everything you're going
to have to do tomorrow,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.241 align:middle line:84%
everybody you've
got to connect with,

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
everybody that's
connecting to you.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.673 align:middle line:84%
And sit on the side of the bed,
and just think of all of that,

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and just see all that
swirling above your head, all

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:90%
the action, all the activities.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, shake your
hands to activate

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:90%
the action in your hands.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And reach up like you
can gather or connect

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
all of that activity,
all of those actions.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:90%
And think of it as yellow.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Once again, that's
an active color.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And bring your right
hand down in front of you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
like you can hold
a bowl or a vessel,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and bringing your left
hand into this a-OK symbol.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And imagine with these
fingers that are pointed up--

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes
now, because we're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:90%
trying to shut the body down.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Imagine with these
three fingers,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you've got a rope that you can
tug all this yellow activity

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And slowly bringing that
energy down, filling this bowl,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
imagine you can just draw down
into this bowl or this cup

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're holding.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale
slowly, imagine

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
you're drawing that whole
cloud of yellow energy

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
slowly down into this bowl.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And see the bowl filling
with this yellow fluid,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:90%
yellow action.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.687 align:middle line:84%
Put the tongue to your
roof of your mouth.

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:42.895 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in through your nose.

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.379 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Breathe out through your mouth.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, slowly just tug,
and just fill this bowl

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
with all the activity.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And bring it down,
slowly, slowly,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
breathing in through your nose,
out through your mouth, tongue

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:90%
to the roof of the mouth.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to about
the level of your heart,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
pause, and look up
to see if there's

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
any little last yellow
energy up there.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Are there any little
activities, any tendrils

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
left that you need to do,
and gather all of them

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
until there's no more
yellow cloud above you.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It's all in this
bowl in front of you.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And just see, like, a
ball of yellow energy.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And once you've gathered it
all, release your left hand,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and imagine you can cap
the top of this bowl.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.055 align:middle line:84%
And now bring your
hands side to side,

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
as though you've got a
yellow ball of energy.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
All the activity that you're
going to need to do tomorrow--

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:90%
not now-- it's all right here.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And then slowly bring this in.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Bring it into the lower
belly, into your belly.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you bring this
ball of yellow energy in,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
imagine it displaces
the white energy that we

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:90%
gathered in the morning.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're turning ourselves
into the hard-boiled egg.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have a ball of
yellow energy surrounded

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:90%
by white energy, stillness.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So the activity's in the
middle, and the stillness

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
is on the outside.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And just pause here
for several breaths.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And with your eyes still
closed and the tongue

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
on the roof of your mouth
and your hands on your belly,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.725 align:middle line:90%
fall over to the side into bed.

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:34.684 align:middle line:90%
And go to sleep.

00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I guess it worked.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.249 align:middle line:90%
Now, we've got that filmed.

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Watch that over and over.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And remember that the
power of the visualization

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
that, folks, that's

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
where you're going
to have so much fun,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
because the better
you get at that,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.396 align:middle line:84%
and the more you
expand your imagination

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and start to have
those visualizations,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:90%
that will give you real power.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.035 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be something
you'll always work on.

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And it just really is powerful.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And that'll put you into such
a beautiful, deep little sleep.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And you'll wake up popping.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And before long, you'll have
this massive energy, all right?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:90%
We've given it to you.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye for now.
