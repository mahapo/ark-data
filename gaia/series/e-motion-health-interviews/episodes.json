Every time we judge we create a tidal wave that crushes our opportunity to grow and thrive in happiness. But so often our judgement is not even our own. It’s judgement accumulated from those around us, society and old beliefs which are no longer a true reflection of your inner state of health. \r\n\r\nAsk yourself, “If I had no judgement in this situation, what could I choose?”  Then let us know what you are ready to let go of in the comments section.","teaser":"In today’s episode of E-Motion Health, Ty is talking with Dr. Dain Heer, founder of Access Consciousness.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/3ff81f5f-2e35-43a1-ad07-046827c46646/181315-emotion-health-s1e8_Access-Consciousness_w_Dain-Heer_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/19579662-e5a2-4d4a-bd58-0bddc49307f5/181315-emotion-health-s1e8_Access-Consciousness_w_Dain-Heer_16x9-clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/19579662-e5a2-4d4a-bd58-0bddc49307f5/181315-emotion-health-s1e8_Access-Consciousness_w_Dain-Heer_16x9-clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/19579662-e5a2-4d4a-bd58-0bddc49307f5/181315-emotion-health-s1e8_Access-Consciousness_w_Dain-Heer_16x9-clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":180847,"seriesTitle":"E-Motion Health Interviews","seriesPath":"series/e-motion-health-interviews","seriesVoteDownCount":55,"seriesVoteUpCount":479,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/f940580f-72e2-4934-8b05-270c1104236f/181357-emotion-health-s1e9_Ty-Hungerford-on-Earthing_cvr.jpg","created":"2019-02-26","episode":9,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/276ad8a4-1372-4bc3-826c-c43f4a2242be/181357-emotion-health-s1e9_Ty-Hungerford-on-Earthing_16x9.jpg","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/80d94585-473a-4e8f-839a-3ad97ef2a738/181357-emotion-health-s1e9_Ty-Hungerford-on-Earthing_hero-clean.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/earthing","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/f940580f-72e2-4934-8b05-270c1104236f/181357-emotion-health-s1e9_Ty-Hungerford-on-Earthing_cvr.jpg","published":true,"season":1,"title":"Earthing","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":28,"voteUpCount":367,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":11,"seasonCount":1,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":478,"mediaId":179406,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":179406,"isFree":false},"id":181357,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"In many ways the Earth is a six-trillion-ton battery.

Water, bugs, viruses, animals and humans – everything in and around us is in electrical energy and communication with the Earth. \r\n\r\nAll energy, all movement, all the emotion, all behavior comes from electrical energy.
