00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey guys, I'm Ty.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to
talk about muscle testing.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Muscle testing is basically
a skill or a tool that you

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
can use, and overtime, when
you develop confidence with it,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
it's basically a way to bypass
your conscious thinking mind

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and get into your
body, and find out

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the real truth
about any statement,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether it's
whether job is good for me,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
whether this girl
is good for me,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.896 align:middle line:84%
whether this food
is good for me.

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.811 align:middle line:84%
You can ask yourself
questions about your body

00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and find out the truth
about what's going on.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Anything that comes
inside your energy sphere,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and we all understand that
everything is energy, guys.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%
You've got to understand that.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
If you break it down
to an atomic level,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:90%
everything is energy.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So when something comes
into your energy sphere,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
in and around your body, your
body has a reaction to it,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system
has a reaction to it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle movement
is a neurological event.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Basically, information
is sent through the body,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
into the nervous system, up
the spine, and into the brain.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And there, from
the brain, dictates

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.367 align:middle line:90%
the movement of the muscles.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's something
that's good for you,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:90%
the muscles are strong.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
If it's something that's
weak, the muscles go weak.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The kinesiology was
adopted by a guy

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
named David Hawkins, who wrote
a book called "Power Versus

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Force."

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
What he did to basically
prove to the world

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
that this is a science--

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
this is not just some, you
know, hoochie, groovy, mystical

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
stuff, this is a dead
set science-- was

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:90%
he got 1,000 people in a room.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
He gave them all
a white envelope,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.482 align:middle line:84%
an enclosed white envelope that
you couldn't see in, right,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and he got every single
person to come up

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
on stage, one at a time, and
they'd hold that white envelope

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:90%
to their chest.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And half the people had
organic vitamin C in there,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and the other half had
an artificial sweetener.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And every single person
that got up there and had

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
the artificial sweetener,
and held it to their chest

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
and held their arm out,
while the other person tested

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.904 align:middle line:84%
whether the muscles went
strong or weak, went weak.

00:02:11.904 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And every single person
that had the organic vitamin

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:90%
C, when tested, was strong.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind is
like 90% of your brain power.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like 1,000 times stronger
than your conscious mind.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.346 align:middle line:84%
You get into your subconscious
mind and your nervous system--

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're doing
when we're muscle testing--

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
you can get to the
truth of things.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, guys.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.885 align:middle line:84%
Now we can actually
physically show you

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
how to do four different
types of muscle testing.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.999 align:middle line:84%
Now, one type might
work better for some guy

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and one type might work
better for another.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first one we're
going to talk about

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
is the double ring test.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So we get the left hand
and we make a ring.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We get the right two fingers
here, we make a ring.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And just start off by making
a statement, my name is Ty.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I test that,
it tests strong,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:90%
because that's the truth right.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I can do the same test
and say, my name is Justin.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have an
immediate response,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because I'm basically saying
a lie, so my muscle goes weak.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not about squeezing
your fingers as hard you can

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and pressing, and all this.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
find what works for you.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
A second type of ring test
a lot of people like to use

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is basically you get your two
fingers squished up like this,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.944 align:middle line:84%
and you get your left hand
which creates that circle.

00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And you get inside there and
you ask yourself the question

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
or make the statement,
my name is Ty.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And try and break that,
and it's strong, right?

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.301 align:middle line:84%
And I make a false statement
like, my name is Justin,

00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's much more easy for
me to open that circle up,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:90%
because I basically told a lie.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.687 align:middle line:84%
My nervous system
has picked up on it,

00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and it makes my muscles go weak.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But I can think of someone
that I really love,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
and I can't break that, right?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can think of someone
that's aggravated me

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or someone I might have
some bad feelings about,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy for me to do that.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing
these muscle tests,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
it's important you don't
try and over think it.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't try and think about
a million different things

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:90%
or try and really make it work.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.555 align:middle line:84%
The best thing you can do is
just kind of have a blank mind,

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and let it make the answers for
us and let it get to the truth,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.995 align:middle line:84%
You can't use this to
predict the future,

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's no point really
going into the past too much.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
You really want to
make statements.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Just make clear cut, concise
statements about what's

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
going on your present life.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.234 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
to use this material.

00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The third technique that
I'm going to show you

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:90%
is using the elbow.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It's called an elbow technique.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
You basically hold your
arm here at 90 degrees.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.074 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna apply pressure.

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Just give me an absolute yes.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
It's strong.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Give me an absolute no.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's not as strong.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It goes weak.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it's a gift
that we all have access to,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.577 align:middle line:84%
So the more you use it,
it's like a skill set.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
begin to trust in it,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and the more that part of
your psychology or your brain

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:90%
will evolve.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:84%
A fourth method
that we can use is

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:90%
called the swaying technique.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine that your
head was like on a pendulum.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
If you sway forward, is
it a positive response?

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
If you sway backwards,
it's a negative response.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And one way we can use
this, guys, is to test food.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We can really use it to test
whether food is good for you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
You can get an apple
that's an organic apple

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and hold it to your body,
and you'll sway strong,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
you'll sway forward.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get an apple
that's genetically

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
modified with pesticides
and herbicides,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it,
hold it to your body,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and you'll sway back.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Make a statement that's true.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:90%
My name is Ty.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that little
subtle movement forward.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:90%
It's weird how it works.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I have no real--

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
understand how it works,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
it works, right?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I stand in the same
position, but focus.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING]

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
My name is John Diggler.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.017 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's obviously a no.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
who John Diggler is.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
OK guys, just to recap
those individual--

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
those four different
steps that we used.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
We've got the double
ring technique,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people
love to use that.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
We've got the open
pinch technique.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.073 align:middle line:90%
| got the elbow technique.

00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Pushing down, finding out
the truth and the validity

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of any statement.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've got that
swaying technique.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.351 align:middle line:84%
Swaying forward is a positive,
swaying negative is a negative.

00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Have a look, and
start experimenting
