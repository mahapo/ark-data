00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.974 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, everyone.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.845 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to learn
some QiGong from T.J.

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's got some
super special tactics

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that he's learned from
two Chinese masters.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do a morning
routine and an evening routine.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:90%
They're quick.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:90%
They're sharp.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you do
this, folks, you'll

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
find your energy levels
increasing so much more.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's such-- it's
real energy work.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're so lucky to have
T.J. because he's been

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:90%
doing this stuff for so long.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.124 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to give
us secrets that just,

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
you just couldn't
learn overnight.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.165 align:middle line:84%
So, TJ, really looking
forward to this.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
have to do this.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> We really appreciate it.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.443 align:middle line:84%
The more people that do it,
the better world we'll have.

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's three elements
to combine to really get

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:90%
the most out of QiGong, right?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So QiGong is energy
work, or energy exercise.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Qi is energy.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Gong means work.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We talk about energy
workers in the West.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
QiGong is doing energy
work on yourself.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Assuming you just wake
up in the morning,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
stand up on the
side of your bed.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Get really nice and relaxed.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Connect to that yin still
space that you just woke up.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And just like a cat, when
you wake up open your eyes,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
stretch your body,
wiggle your fingers.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Bring your hands down.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Shake your hands
to activate them.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And now come up to the
center of the chest,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
percussing the
center of the chest.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And use a tight fist,
a clenched fist,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
pinky side down, and
percuss your skeleton.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Wake up your bones.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Open your right arm and
percuss down the bone.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And look to your bone.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Where the mind goes,
the energy follows.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you can bring the
blood, the life force energy,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:90%
into your bone.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And come up the outside of your
bones, and look at your bone,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and percuss the bone.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Go over to the skull.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Percuss the skull.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Go down the vertebrae, the
collarbone, the arm bones,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:90%
the forearm, the hand.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And just percuss the bone.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Look at your bone and imagine
you're invigorating your bone.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Center of the chest, around
the ribs, down the spine.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Tight fist now, you want
to really percuss bone.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Pull in your navel to
support your low back.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Now would we use a
yellow energy here T.J.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we're visualizing
at the same time?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a deeper
visualization.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
For the simplicity, you
can just think of blood.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you want
to make it deeper,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
imagine you're drawing
yellow sunlight, the birth

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:90%
of a new day, yang qi.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the side of
a loosely clenched fist,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
finger side down, bring that
yang qi, yellow light, or blood

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:90%
into your muscles.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And do the same sequence,
looking at your muscles,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and imagine you can
invigorate your muscle layer.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yellow energy,
yellow light, or just blood

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
if you prefer--

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:90%
yang energy into your muscles.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel a sticky muscle,
spend a little more time there.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Then switch up at
the top of the head.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Go to the other side and go down
the outside of your left arm

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
with a loosely clenched
fist, finger side down.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, come up.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Open your breath.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding your
breath, you hold the qi.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
have an open breath.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And invigorate your muscles.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:90%
And go around the back.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And go up and down your spine.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Go along your back,
up and down the spine.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And that tongue thing, too.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about that tongue
thing that you told me to do?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>> There's another trick you do.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
layers to QiGong.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
It could be done really
simple or really complex.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
If you want to bring the
corner knuckle of your fist

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and fluff
the muscles of your hips.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Typically QiGong,
you'd have your tongue

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to the roof of your mouth,
breathing over your tongue.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Now come up the
inside of the legs.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Squat to open up
the inguinal pocket.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
This helps protect
people from hernias.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And this next one's really
tough, but it's really helpful.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Soften your abdominal wall.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And now open up and
invigorate the visceral organs

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
of your abdomen.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll see as I
percuss my abdomen,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll see waves move
through my belly.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And this wakes up your guts.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It wakes up all the organs
so that they function well

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Back up to the chest.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Last time through,
with an open hand,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%
slap the surface of your skin.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Visualize your pores opening,
and visualize the blood

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.525 align:middle line:84%
coming to the lymphatic,
and the endocrine,

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and the superficial
layer of the body.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You go over the shoulder, up
under the jaw, over the top,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
switching, down the opposite
arm, down the outside

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
of the opposite arm.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Slapping the skin,
bringing your energy,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that yellow light, the
yang qi, to your surface.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Center of chest, around to
the back, over the kidneys,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:90%
waking up the kidneys.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Down the legs.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Up the inside of the legs.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Over the belly.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Three breaths through
your nose over the chest.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And then come to a
complete and abrupt halt.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all your pores
can open and imagine

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.745 align:middle line:84%
bringing in fresh air through
every pore of your body.

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And imagine releasing any of
the stuck, gray, turbid energy

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
as you exhale.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We've dispersed the yellow
energy, the yang qi,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
to the outside of the body.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel your yang qi
on your surface right now?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my whole body
is absolutely buzzing.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome, man.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So now visualize there's
a white energy as well.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:90%
A yin, a still energy.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And now gather the
yin, the still energy,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and bring the yellow
to the outside

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and the white to the inside,
like an inverted boiled egg.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to have
the white in the center,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
the stillness in the center.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And leave the yang.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tingling on your skin.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the yellow.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And this will allow us
to be still in our mind

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and in our hearts
through our day,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
but still allow our bodies
to be dynamic and active.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Rub your belly.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready to
go out onto your day.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
You've woken up.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:90%
That easy, huh?

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That easy.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Three tools.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
First tool, tight fist, pinky
side down, percussing the bone.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Next tool, loose hand,
finger side down,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:90%
percussing the muscle.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.441 align:middle line:84%
Last tool, open hand,
slapping the skin.

00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So there'll be
the physical side.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.033 align:middle line:84%
All of us are going
to be to get that.

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Combine that with the breath.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:90%
That's another element.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you
start to visualize,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:90%
remember that yellow light.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.796 align:middle line:84%
And then doing the three things,
going from bone to muscle

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to skin, that's the side that
you'll always be working on.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And the more you visualize,
the more you'll get out of it.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'll realize
the power of the mind

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to move the energy around
your body, so you wake up--

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:90%
boom!

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.856 align:middle line:90%
Ready to take that--

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
because when, you said
we're in the sleeping state,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:90%
we're in the egg state.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, all the energy is in
here and around the organs.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we're trying to get
that, take it to the outside.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we're about to go into
the nighttime QiGong, which

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
actually reverse that.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What I just showed
you, do not do at night.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:90%
You'll have very restless sleep.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So we just learned
morning QiGong folks.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.108 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- what
did it take us?

00:07:49.108 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:90%
2, 3, 4, 5 minutes.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
ideal way that's come

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
from thousands of years from
Chinese mastery to you from TJ.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:90%
So implement it into your life.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do it, I'm
going come out there

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get you
and I'm going to find you.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to
be doing this QiGong.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change
every aspect of your life.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:20.246 align:middle line:90%
