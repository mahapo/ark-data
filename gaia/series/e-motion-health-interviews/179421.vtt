00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I know
what you're saying.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
What is Ty doing with a
black shirt and jeans?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you what.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We have a very special guest
with us today, Miss Inna Segal.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for coming
and saying hello to us.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Very nice to meet you.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice to be here.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you come about
your healing technique?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And could you maybe tell
us a little bit about that

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and what it's called?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called visionary
intuitive healing.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
And I really started
from when I was about 19,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:90%
and I was in a lot of pain.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I could hardly walk,
so my back was degenerating.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I was going to see
everyone you can imagine.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.425 align:middle line:84%
I had really bad digestive
problems, psoriasis all

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:18.225 align:middle line:90%
over my skin--

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.925 align:middle line:84%
>> --and anxiety
from all of that.

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And I just--

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I got to a point where I didn't
know if I could continue.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I woke up,
and my back was twisted.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I told my partner to take
me to the chiropractor's office.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there, the
chiropractor had heard,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and he came out of his
office into the foyer,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
just took one look at me, and
told me that my body was stuck.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
I know that part.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
What can you do about this?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was very relaxed
and silent, and then he said,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:90%
"Nothing."

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you mean nothing?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your body
wants to be stuck.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So on the way home,
I was pretty angry.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And at one point
it occurred to me

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that I had been to
everyone by that stage.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It was literally
to a point that I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
was going to see someone
five days a week at least.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, you
know, my body has a language.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I don't know it.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.146 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's
speaking Japanese,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't learned it yet.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
realization was

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to heal
myself, because no one

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:90%
else has done it.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only way
I was going to progress.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know how to do it.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:90%
So I went home.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when you're in
a lot of pain, the way you do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
things is a lot
stronger than when

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:90%
it's coming through your mind.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me that maybe I
really need divine intervention

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:90%
for this to actually work.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, God, I'm
talking to you.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And since I--

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I was open minded,
but I was skeptical

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.257 align:middle line:84%
that it could actually work
physically on any level, kind

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:90%
of asking for divine help.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, look, if there
is something divine out there,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I need help, and I
need it right now.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And I wasn't expecting
anything, but all of a sudden,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this warmth and
tingling through my whole body.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And because I had
my eyes closed,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I just kept seeing
this gold light.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all right,
something's happening.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And the next thought
that I had was,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to see into my body.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
where that came from.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, it felt like a switch
had gone on, and I literally--

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I could literally
see into my body.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was scary,
I have to say.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It was not a nice experience.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I saw all the inflammation.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I actually saw my spine.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was just saying, why?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have this?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was really the
turning point, I feel,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
for my healing
journey and my work.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a
sudden, I realized

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that my body was
intelligent and that I

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:90%
could access information.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a
sudden, I started

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of the fact
that I had been incredibly

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:90%
negative for a lot of my life.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:90%
I felt like all the emotions.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was very interesting,
because I thought,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.252 align:middle line:90%
I've done acting.

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:25.335 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do emotions.

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And so as I was breathing, I
just kept going into this layer

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:10%
after layer of emotions that
I had never really recognized.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it was rejection
and a huge anger and fear.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all right, OK,
I'm willing to let this go.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm just-- I'm letting go.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I let myself feel instead
of controlling it.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I ever--

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, I might have left
my bed for a few minutes

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
here and there, but it
was a real exploration.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- because I
just felt, I'm connecting.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I'm
going to connect in a month.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm connecting now, so
I just need to keep going.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had no clue
what I was doing,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
except that I was
listening to my body.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of this
three weeks, I had no pain,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and I could walk
with no pain at all.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And my psoriasis had
pretty much cleared up.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:90%
My anxiety went right down.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I could eat food that
I couldn't eat before.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So I was fascinated.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And then by default,
I realized that I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
could see into other people's
bodies and their energy field

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and what was going on with them.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
began the journey, of I

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:90%
want to help people.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm here for that.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like you had a
massive emotional shift which

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
led to this enlightenment
and your whole career path.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.692 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that all of us out
there are so oblivious-- well,

00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us out there are so
oblivious to our own emotions?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Is there a-- are we trying
to protect their own selves?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Are we so unaware of--

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
do you have a way of
explaining that to us?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that it's
almost as if when we're born,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:90%
we enter this castle.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And this castle has so
many different rooms.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And each room represents a
creativity or our passion,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
our joy, our anger, our
fear, but with our ability

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:90%
to express it fully.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But as we get older, people
around us will tell us,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:90%
don't cry.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't be a baby.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't be a girl.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't be this.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel that.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:90%
You have to be a man.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Or you have to be stronger.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have thick skin.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
that we're told,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:90%
so we start shutting down.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we're told, you can't
be as good as that person.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It's too hard--
all of this stuff.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's literally we
end up living in this one

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
or two-bedroom apartment rather
than this castle with all

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of these opportunities and
that creativity and ability

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to feel, because we're told
that you're too emotional.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:90%
You're too sensitive.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And you should be like that.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.949 align:middle line:84%
You should be somebody
who is able to deal

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with things without feeling or
without showing your feelings.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:90%
So we shove them down.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize,
because we want to be strong.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We want to appear that
we've got it all together.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%
But most of us don't.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's that poise,
business man and woman

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
are so still and confident.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.949 align:middle line:90%
In reality, so what--

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:84%
you think that after
you've been practicing

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that for a while, all of a
sudden there's these walls,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and they've become trapped.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get
into depression,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because we can't express
ourselves and taking medication

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and shutting ourselves
down even more.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just
into survival.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even OK
to look after yourself

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:90%
until you're sick.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because who has the
luxury to do that?

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
finding, that now

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
what was seen as a luxury
before is a necessity.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
We need to connect.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we become totally
disconnected with our bodies.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we
think that we can heal

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
is through taking pills
instead of the fact

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that a body is
actually-- we're actually

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
created to be intelligent
and amazing and wise,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and not only to give
us advice or, I guess,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
a way of being healthy, but
also to allow us to open up

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
our intuition and to guide
us to where we need to go

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and to take us into
these amazing experiences

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.645 align:middle line:90%
of expansion of consciousness.

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So with these
techniques that you use,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
is there anything that could
help build our own intuition

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:90%
up?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And in my new book, "The
Secret of Life Wellness,"

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I begin with that.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that
intuition is so important.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But intuition happens when
we connect to the heart.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So even though often we
can get intuitive messages

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
from our solar plexus
or from the sacral.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the sacral is
that instant hit.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:90%
This is when you know.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And the solar plexus
is when you have

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to work through your
emotions, and often you

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
need maybe 24 hours
to figure out,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
what's my intuition
really telling me?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And people need to understand
that some things take time.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I found that
when we open the heart,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I think when we let go
of all those barriers

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
that keep us locked up
inside, then our intuition

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%
can just flourish.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So talking about the heart,
I know a lot of people out there

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
are wondering when they're going
to find their soul mate and is

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that possible.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know I find I
fall into that category.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure there is--

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is there parts of
your intuition tactics

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that can help us with
that scenario that

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
help to bring and attract
that soul mate into our lives?

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, when the heart
opens and we feel--

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
we start to feel
good about ourselves,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
there is an energy
that is attractive one.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But also, when we are
working on ourselves,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
we start to become very clear
on what kind of a person

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
we want to attract.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is a difference
between attracting

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
a partner that could be a really
great partner and a soul mate.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Because from my exploration,
massive exploration

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
of soul mates, they're
not necessarily here

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:90%
to make life easy for you.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They're the people that
challenge you the most.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you have them as
partners, you really better

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:90%
be evolving.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they will push
every button you have.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not just all
beauty and love.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to open
up our ability

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:84%
to love to such an
incredible extent

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
like we've never felt before.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going to bring
up the pain that we have not

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:90%
processed like never before.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Every part of
you is on the line.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to give us
some more of your secrets.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things
that you incorporate

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
into your daily
routine that maybe we

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%
can steal off you that
would help increase

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:90%
our energies on a daily basis.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
My first big thing is intention.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've discovered

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
is that your first thought--

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and literally your first
thought when you wake up

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
can either re-energize you,
or you can lose about 70%

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of your energy,
depending on what it is.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's time we
move on to a little healing

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:90%
for Tyzee.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
During the exchange,
we've magically

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:90%
changed some things around.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We thought we didn't want
to show all her powers,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.111 align:middle line:90%
so we took that off the camera.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But now we're facing
each other, and we're

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
about to begin a
healing session.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So I have no idea
what's going to happen.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Inna, you take charge.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first part, the
first thing that I'm seeing is

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
actually your heart is coming
up really strongly for me.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
I guess protection--

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:90%
we'll call it that--

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:90%
around the heart.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost like I feel--

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the protection is
very, very strong.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
If I had to choose
an element, it

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
would be like it's
inside a metal.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And if I want to use my x-ray
vision and go beyond that,

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:90%
then I see the heart inside.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like in this metal box.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's little.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's vulnerable.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's definitely hidden.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand what
I'm talking about?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And the heart does want to
grow, and it wants to come out.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:90%
But there are so many barriers.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the heart
is of a little child.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm seeing.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It definitely connects
back to you as a little boy

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:90%
not being seen.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And I can see the image.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I can actually see you as
this little boy and just so--

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
very innocent, very,
very, very innocent

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and asking to be recognized.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense,
just acknowledge me.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge that I'm here.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And no one's there.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.205 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the word again
that I'm getting is ignored.

00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I see you as this little
boy just going into this ball

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and just hiding.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually if I work
like this, I play

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
music, because it makes--
it allows me to get in.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Let the emotion, whatever
you haven't cried or spoken

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Just wanted to be
acknowledged and loved

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.658 align:middle line:90%
and caressed and feel safe.

00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
[SNIFFS] All right,
everyone, we've

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
just had an amazing experience.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We actually turned
the cameras off.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.865 align:middle line:84%
It went on longer, and
it got quite personal.

00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's
appropriate for everybody.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:90%
But I can tell you something.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We've had a lot of special
people on this show,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
but Inna and her
level of intuition

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is just something
that you can't learn.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just a magical thing.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.422 align:middle line:10%
So this book, if it has any
of what I've just experienced

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:10%
or anything that
I've just learned,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:10%
you definitely
need to read this.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Because she is a magical woman.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
"The Secret of Life Wellness"--
