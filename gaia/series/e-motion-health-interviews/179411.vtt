[music playing]

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:33.728 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:90%
This is Ty.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Today we're down the beach.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.671 align:middle line:84%
We just saw some dolphins
out to our right.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:90%
There's surfers here.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.506 align:middle line:90%
I've got my shoes off.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm down in the sand.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm soaking up the
energy of the Earth.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to
talk to you about EMFs.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:90%
What are EMFs?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
They're electromagnetic
frequencies.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:90%
They're invisible.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't know much about them.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:90%
We can't see them.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:90%
But we know that they're there.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And before all the mobile
phones and before all the Wi-Fi

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and all that technology,
all we had was natural EMFs.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And one man that
worked all that out

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:90%
was named Winfried Schumann.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
He basically worked out
that the Earth is constantly

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
letting out a frequency
into the ionosphere.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Those frequencies can
be measured in hertz.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth's frequency
as measured at 7.83 hertz.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is constantly
beaming out a frequency

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
into the ionosphere, right?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, guess what else
they worked out?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.702 align:middle line:84%
The brain lets out what
we call alpha waves.

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And guess what
they're measured at?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:90%
7.83 hertz.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I think what it means is, over
hundreds and thousands of years

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
we have come in
sync with the Earth.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
That we vibrate a frequency
that matches the Earth.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
when you go outside

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.139 align:middle line:90%
you feel really, really good.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to test it guys.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Be indoors, be in all
the artificial light

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest
of it, walk outside

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
and you instantly feel better.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's a really
cool experiment

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
they did that kind of
proved all of this.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
These bunch of scientists
got all these students

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and put them in these
underground bunkers.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And these underground
bunkers, it blocked out

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.651 align:middle line:84%
all the natural EMFs that
the Earth emits, right?

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.337 align:middle line:84%
So after one, two, three
hours, after a few days,

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden every
single one of those students

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.567 align:middle line:90%
was getting headaches.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
They weren't being
able to sleep well.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't focus.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
They were just
basically feeling down.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And then what the
scientists did is

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
they had a little made
transmitter in there.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
They started sending
out all these EMFs

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
at the same hertz, the 7.83,
the natural reoccurring

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:90%
hertz of the Earth.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.205 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden
within minutes,

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
within hours, every single
student was feeling better.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:90%
They were able to focus.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.049 align:middle line:90%
They were able to sleep.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:90%
They were able to read.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
we're in sync.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Even though we
can't see it, guys,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
we're in sync with the
frequencies of the Earth.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take it
another step further.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
In 2006, we lost in
some countries 70%

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:90%
of all their honeybees.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was trying
to work out, what's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:90%
happened to all our honeybees?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honeybees are
essential for life.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:90%
We know this, guys.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
They pollinate all our
nuts and our seeds.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.126 align:middle line:84%
What one guy worked out, he
set up these eight beehives

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and he put a deck phone
in five of the hives.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.184 align:middle line:84%
Now, a deck phone is
like a cordless phone,

00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
like in your home when you're
talking on a cordless phone?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.247 align:middle line:84%
So he put these deck
phones in five hives.

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And those five hives
that had the deck

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
phones, 90% of the bees did
not return back to the hive.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the hives,
not one single be returned

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:90%
which is very alarming.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, next to that was
another three hives.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And in those three hives,
all the bees came back.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Bees basically navigate with
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In the last 30 years we
have flooded this planet

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.292 align:middle line:90%
with man made EMFs.

00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
All these new electromagnetic
fields in the air and the bee

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
can't navigate back
to its little hive

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and the bee doesn't
know where it's going.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.353 align:middle line:90%
Who knows where the bee's going?

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But the bees aren't
there anymore.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we know it's
affecting nature.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take it
another step further.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
We know that EMFs are
affecting our bodies

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
because the microwaves
that are being sent

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
from the mobile phone tower
to your phone that are then

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
going through your skull
and affecting your brain

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:90%
are affecting your melatonin.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is the body's
most powerful antioxidant.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:84%
It's five times more
powerful than vitamin C,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
it's twice as powerful as
vitamin E. What melatonin

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
does in your brain is, when
it detects that you're asleep

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.241 align:middle line:84%
and there's no light around,
when your cells are recreating

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
at night there's a waste
product called free radicals.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.156 align:middle line:84%
And the melatonin
basically goes through

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
and flushes all your
free radicals out so

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have healthy
cell reproduction.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.647 align:middle line:90%
That's what melatonin does.

00:04:22.647 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
on your phone all the time

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.402 align:middle line:84%
and you got this phone on
your head day in day out,

00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you're actually affecting
your melatonin, guys.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very serious thing.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are in sync with
the natural EMFs of the Earth.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now we've introduced all these
men made EMFs with all the cell

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:84%
phone towers, radio waves,
microwaves, wireless,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:90%
satellites.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.731 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
satellites are doing?

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:90%
They're beaming down EMFs on us.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid it.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
We're actually being saturated.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:90%
We've got a way around that.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got what we call
electromagnetic chaos devices,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and we've got all sorts
of them, something

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.735 align:middle line:90%
that can neutralize these EMFs.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
them in pendants,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:90%
you can wear them on your body.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.993 align:middle line:84%
This is one that I wear, if you
can have a quick look at that.

00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I wear that on my
chest at all times.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really cool.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been really,
really good for me.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.925 align:middle line:90%
Makes me feel better.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And just basically
like I said, it just

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
neutralizes all
those man made EMFs

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
from just bombarding my body.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
This one here, this one here is
kind of cool and interesting.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
This one protects your whole
home from Wi-Fi, everything.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.364 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can get them
for your mobile phone.

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:90%
See these little ones?

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.904 align:middle line:84%
They just stick onto
your mobile phone.

00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
There's one there and
there's another one there.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
All right, team, now we're
going to do a little experiment.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
This is super cool.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.446 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
grab a phone that's

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%
got a chaos device on it.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold it to my chest
and do a little muscle test.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to grab a
phone that doesn't and we're

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.564 align:middle line:84%
going to see if I test
strong or if I test weak.

00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll really put it
to the test for you.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
All right, Fritz, come
on, jump on in here.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.075 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can see this
phone has clearly got

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.261 align:middle line:90%
a chaos device on there.

00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to hold it on.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to focus on the phone.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.615 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell myself that
this phone is good for me.

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:54.715 align:middle line:90%
How'd it go?

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't do it.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't do it.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Test is super
strong, super strong.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.248 align:middle line:84%
You just can't handle
my strength anyway.

00:05:59.248 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:90%
All right, next phone.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
All right, this phone
is almost destroyed

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have a
chaos device on it, OK?

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.864 align:middle line:84%
So right now I'm just
getting bombarded by EMFs.

00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't have my
pendant on either.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, this phone is strong for me.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Pinky finger.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Pinky finger, pinky
finger, pinky finger.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:90%
This phone is good for me.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.115 align:middle line:84%
You could see then, somehow,
someway-- and I don't know.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
how muscle testing work.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But my body detects
that there's EMFs

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.667 align:middle line:84%
bombarding my chest which makes
my muscles instantly go weak.

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try
something new here.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.625 align:middle line:84%
We're going to grab this phone
which doesn't have a chaos

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
device on it, and we're going
to add our little magic dome,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.408 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
put the dome on there.

00:06:42.408 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm going to put
the dome on the inside.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going
to test again.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
All right, this
phone is good for me.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't do it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:90%
So, all we did--

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't walk
around with this goofy thing

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:90%
stuck to your phone every day.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be the
super cool thing to do.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Use your electromagnetic
chaos devices, guys.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Go to Alternate Health.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.385 align:middle line:90%
We've tested a lot of these.

00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We've got the best
ones on there.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You can go on there
and be confident.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.120 align:middle line:90%
We know which ones are good.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Put them on your body,
use the pendants,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
put them on your mobile
phones, get the ones that

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
neutralize your whole house.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And watch over time you'll
start feeling better.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll balance out your
own natural frequency

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and you'll notice over
time you'll feel stronger,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll sleep better, you'll
be able to focus more.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.213 align:middle line:84%
And you be able to do what
we're trying to do here

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
at Alternate Health every day
is bring your vibration up

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and be able to transmit
into the cosmos

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
your dreams and your desires
and feel good and just

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.182 align:middle line:90%
be balanced in your body.

00:07:36.182 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it for me today.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:90%
It's super windy.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.343 align:middle line:84%
I think we're about
to get blown away.

00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:90%
We had so much fun.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:90%
We've been out here in nature.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about one
of the most coolest things

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that we know about.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Mwah.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Love you guys!

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for listening to me.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.478 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you next time.

00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:08:03.798 align:middle line:90%
