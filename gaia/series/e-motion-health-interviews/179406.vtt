00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:33.695 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, everybody.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
This is Ty.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And you'll never guess
what I'm doing right now.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I have got my
feet planted in the Earth.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing
is I'm focusing

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
on creating a communication
between my body and the Earth.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
There's actually electrical
energy flowing up into my body.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's called earthing.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:90%
That's called getting grounded.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
The Earth can be seen
as a massive battery.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.389 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
sextillion-ton metric battery,

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
which is constantly
being replenished

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
by lightning and
solar radiation,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and the molten core
from the Earth.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And just like a
car battery would

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
be in charge of the
electrics for your car,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is in charge of all
the animals and all the living

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
things that are on the
surface and in the water.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
All the bugs and all the
viruses and all humans--

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:84%
everything is in electrical
energy and communication

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
All energy, all movement,
all emotion, all behavior

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:90%
comes from electrical energy.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
get grounded, when

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
we get earthed, what
comes from the Earth

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is the magnetic fields floating
up from the Earth's surface.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And the molten core,
that heat that constantly

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
comes up from the surface--

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.926 align:middle line:84%
well, that's what
regenerates us from our feet

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
up and feeds the 50
trillion cells in your body

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
that are totally reliant upon
electrical and magnetic fields

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.504 align:middle line:84%
to communicate, to pass on
nutrients, to pass on water.

00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:90%
We've always known about it.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
We've always walked and
talked and played and knelt

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and laid down in the Earth.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And now it seems like in
this new industrial age,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
we've lost that connection,
everybody, with all

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
these insulated shoes and
insulated beds and insulated

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:90%
lives in concrete jungles.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
All the soles of your
shoes are made of rubber,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
like an insulator.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
All our beds are elevated-- not
only elevated off the Earth,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:90%
they have insulating mattresses.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And what happens,
without us even knowing,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
is we start to have
all sorts of problems--

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.897 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of problems
like accelerated aging,

00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of problems like
all sorts of stress disorders

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and dysfunctions, and
all the diseases that

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
come from inflammation, like
cancer and diabetes and lupus

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:90%
and allergies.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.026 align:middle line:84%
All these things are related to
the inflammation of the body.

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you haven't got your
feet in the Earth at some time

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
during the day, you're not
getting that natural energy

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
source that comes
through the body.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's all it takes, folks,
is just 20 minutes a day,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
getting the shoes off, and
going for a walk on the Earth.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.622 align:middle line:84%
Or they've got these
bed plates that you

00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
can get that have a copper
wire attached to it,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.163 align:middle line:84%
something you can
stick in the ground,

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:58.264 align:middle line:84%
and you can literally sleep
on a bed that is earthed.

00:02:58.264 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Or you can get
little mats you can

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
put under your computer at
work so your feet are attached

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
There's so many health
benefits that we know about.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It reduces stress.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It does that by
calming the body out.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It actually cools the
immune system down.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.207 align:middle line:84%
It actually cools the stress
hormones down when you get out,

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and you get earthed.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the magical things it
does for me-- every time I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
go traveling, I get
a bit of jet lag.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
You get down, take
your shoes off,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.605 align:middle line:84%
go stand in the
grass or any dirt

00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:90%
that you can get for 20 minutes.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.989 align:middle line:84%
And literally, bam, it's
like your polarities

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:90%
have been all evened out.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:90%
You're energetically balanced.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you're feeling good.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
You're like, OK, I'm going
to go down to the bar

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and have some
margaritas or whatever

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.758 align:middle line:84%
it is you're planning
to do on that trip.

00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's one of the easiest.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And that works 100% of the
time to get rid of jet lag

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
is earthing.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Another great thing
it does is for EMFs.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talked about
electromagnetic fields.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly being bombarded
by all these man-made EMFs.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, by taking your
shoes off and grounding,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the electrical energy that's
coming up from the Earth

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.949 align:middle line:84%
counterbalances
all the other EMFs

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:90%
that are coming into your body.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
amazing health benefit.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things it
does is it reduces

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
menstrual and hormonal stress.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.132 align:middle line:84%
So all you ladies
out there, when

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it's coming that
time in the cycle,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting to
feel a little bit edgy,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.556 align:middle line:84%
take your shoes off, if
you're not doing it already,

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and go for a walk on
the grass, and just

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
notice how it'll reduce that
feeling and those emotions

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:90%
when they come up.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly helpful
for you fellows, too.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
When that time's
coming about, look,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.202 align:middle line:90%
let's not get in an argument.

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for a walk, sweetie.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you know what?

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.051 align:middle line:90%
Let's not wear the shoes.

00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to mention why.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
bring this stuff up.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
trigger something.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You just really want to get out
there and get those shoes off.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish I would have
known this stuff two years ago.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.564 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't
be some single man.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I could have maintained
my relationship.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
cool stuff to know.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It dramatically reduces,
if not eliminates,

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
chronic pain-- you know,
the aching and that pain.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize that
all your body really

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:90%
needs is just to get earthed.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
It just helps out sleep so much.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who's
ever used earthing

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
will find that their
sleep patterns just

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
become consistent, and you
get that really deep sleep.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It helps with your energy flow.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not like you
going to jump in and go,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
wow, all of a sudden,
I feel like Superman.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it constantly,
days and days and days,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that your energy
flow will be much, much better.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the most amazing things
it does is with blood flow.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy who was having
serious problems with his feet.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
He had no nerve
feelings in his feet.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
He'd literally go for
a walk on cold tiles,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't even feel
the temperature of the tiles.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying all
these different things,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.136 align:middle line:90%
and he found out about earthing.

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And he got one of
the bed plates.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.172 align:middle line:84%
And the first day he sat on the
bed plate, after 20 minutes,

00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
he had intense pain in
his feet, and he's like,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm not doing it.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
He went back to his guy and
said, look, that's normal.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Stick with it.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Stick with it.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
So he stuck with it.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And after a month, he started
to get feeling back in his feet.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And he had terribly
bad varicose veins.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.067 align:middle line:84%
It was almost purple and black,
really terrible to look at.

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And after two months, his wife
kind of looked over at his feet

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
one day and went, you know what?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Your feet look beautiful.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.168 align:middle line:84%
He's like, yeah, well, I've
been doing this earthing.

00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
There was another guy with
chronic heart problems.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:90%
He had bad chest.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
He had rapid heartbeats
and irregular heartbeats.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And he tried every
single medication.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.152 align:middle line:84%
The guy was a top lawyer, so he
had that real business stress.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And some of us, we can't
avoid business stress.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:90%
We're making big decisions.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.266 align:middle line:90%
We're making a lot of money.

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
He started using
earthing, and he

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
found that over
one to two years,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:90%
he stopped all his medication.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
All the drugs and all the
stuff and all the doctors

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and all the thousands of dollars
that he spent was unnecessary.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
All he needed to do
was take his shoes off

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.802 align:middle line:90%
and go for a walk in the grass.

00:06:18.802 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for people to even
comprehend that-- well, no no,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking this.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking-- no,
forget taking that.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Just take your shoes
off, and go for a walk.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.325 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh,
well, what do you mean?

00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're talking
about, earthing-- so simple.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It's so simple,
but it's so true.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And once you get out,
and you start trying it,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.288 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
notice a difference

00:06:35.288 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:90%
in your overall energy.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's kind of become
aware to all of us

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
with this amazing
book called Earthing.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been co-written by Clinton
Ober, Dr. Stephen Sinatra,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and Martin Zucker.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Stephen Sinatra
is a top cardiologist,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and he's now using earthing
in so many of his patients

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.044 align:middle line:90%
now and finding amazing results.

00:06:55.044 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you get this book
and have a look through it,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
cool testimonies.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.557 align:middle line:84%
And there's too many
for us to talk about.

00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you get the book,
you'll just see it.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.015 align:middle line:84%
And that'll really
give you confidence.

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It'll give you inspiration.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And it'll get you to
just go, you know what?

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Stop this.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting my shoes off,
and I'm going for a walk.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that's what
we're going to do right now,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%
folks.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
We've had enough
of looking at me.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I've had enough of
talking about this.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You're going to experience
it for yourself.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get your shoes off.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Go and get your shoes off,
and go for a walk right

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.644 align:middle line:90%
now on the grass, on the dirt.

00:07:21.644 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And keep doing this day after
day, and you're going to go,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.535 align:middle line:84%
That Ty from Alternative
Health, he was right, man.

00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I feel so much better.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:90%
What have you been doing, man?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Have you been going to doctors?

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
No, I've just been going
out and getting earthed.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:90%
All right, guys.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Go get earthed.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Take your shoes off.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:90%
See you.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Love you.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:90%
