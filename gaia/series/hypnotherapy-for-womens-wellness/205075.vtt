[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the "Falling
Pregnant Hypnotherapy" audio.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But for now, there's
nothing at all

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.055 align:middle line:84%
And concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune into
your body-mind system.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain
to relax, the left

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and the right lobes of
the brain just releasing,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
just letting go completely.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around
your eyes and eyelids,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
down into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
You make better decisions.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.275 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more in
control of your days.

00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So noticing, now,
how your neck feels,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.055 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension and you may
be holding in your shoulder

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.902 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your
shoulders now as you

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
take the relaxation down, now,
into the tops of your arms,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
letting any tension you may
be holding just drain away.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your wrists
and into your hands and way

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.365 align:middle line:84%
down into the very tips of
your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself just

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
relaxing even more
deeply, allowing

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area,
now, to simply drain away,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.705 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination, you
send the sunlight out, now,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.561 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It knows what to do as
you take the relaxation

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
round into your back muscles.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And from your back
muscles, it relaxes

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
those muscles, either
side of the spine,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
releasing, relaxing,
and just letting

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:90%
go now, deeper and deeper now.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your waist and
the muscles of your lower

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
stomach and down into the
pelvic area, all the way

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
down through the
large thigh muscles,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
just to allow all those areas
of the body to relax and let go.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles and to your feet,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
all the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.205 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So 8, 7, 6, 5.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Deeper now.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:90%
4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.715 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in a
deeply relaxed state,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to focus
on your desire

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.395 align:middle line:84%
to successfully conceive and
give birth to a healthy baby.

00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It may be that, in
the past, you may

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
have felt anxious or perhaps
even desperate to conceive

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and to enjoy healthy pregnancy.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And if so, I'm sure you've
heard this lots of times before.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Couples who try can
be trying too hard.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of others who,

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
after trying to conceive for
years upon end, stop trying

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and either resign themselves
to a childless life,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and then just a
few months later,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
their first little
miracle's been conceived.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
In hypnosis, we refer to this
as the law of reversed effect.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can use this technique
to your own advantage

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.055 align:middle line:84%
by learning how to
let go and to relax.

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So by listening to
this audio, you'll

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
be learning how to do just
that, to let go, to relax,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and to go deeper and deeper
into gentle hypnotic rest.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The law reversed effect
states that, the greater

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.455 align:middle line:84%
the conscious effort, the less
the subconscious response.

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Or understood
another way, whenever

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
the will, your conscious
mind, and imagination,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
mind, are in conflict,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
it's always the imagination,
the subconscious, that wins.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So from now on in, you will
imagine and visualize yourself

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:90%
falling pregnant.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, you will
train your subconscious mind

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that it is indeed
easy to fall pregnant.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You no longer use
the word "trying,"

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:90%
as this means failing.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to try because
you're not going to fail.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
You're going to succeed and
to conceive and give birth

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to your own little
bundle of joy.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You instinctively know
that, from now on, you

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:90%
are not going to try.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.945 align:middle line:90%
You are going to succeed.

00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're deeply relaxed
and feeling so sleepy,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
drifting deeper and deeper
into gentle hypnotic rest.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine,
now, that you're

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in a garden or a
field or a space where

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
you've decided that you
want to plant some seeds.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a glorious day.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It feels warm on your
skin, and that pleases you.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:84%
You feel calm and relaxed,
enjoying this brand-new day.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You freshly dig
and prepare an area

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
especially for your new seeds,
giving them the optimum space.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They're ready to grow.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
As you plant the seeds,
you can see everything.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see deep inside
the soil and high above it.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And in hypnosis, there's
no such thing as time,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and weeks and months can go by
in just a fraction of a second.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can see and
enjoy the process

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of those seeds that you've
planted, starting to grow.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
You watch as you lovingly
water and nurture your seeds.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Through the days
and seasons, you

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
keep caring for your
plants, feeding them,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
ensuring they're protected from
anything in the environment,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
watching the germination stage
as the shoots begin to appear.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And when the
conditions are right,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
the plants seem to
spurt up immediately.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You realize the conditions
are just as they should be.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
The soil is perfect, and
they have food and water,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to grow and
produce this healthy crop.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious mind
understands everything

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that it hears, and it
understands the metaphor

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:90%
here today.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Just allowing yourself
to completely enjoy

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.735 align:middle line:84%
this feeling of freedom
and relaxation today.

00:17:40.735 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you even forget about
the thought of having a baby.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
You just know, in the
back of your mind,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that it will happen whilst also
recognizing that it will only

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
happen when you let
go, when you trust,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
when you remember
that everything

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:90%
is just as it should be.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Your seed will grow.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Your conditions are perfect.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You're learning to thoroughly
relax now, to let go,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:90%
and to believe in yourself.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself with
your partner now.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
You set the scene for some
special time together.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful atmosphere,
and the conversation

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
is flowing about ideas and
interests that you both share.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
The setting is right, and
the last thing on your mind

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:90%
is the thought of having a baby.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
All you want to do is enjoy the
quality time with your partner.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
After a perfect evening
together, you eventually

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
retire to bed.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious
mind instinctively

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
knows the right time for
you to conceive without even

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.885 align:middle line:90%
knowing that it knows.

00:19:08.885 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
What your mind believes,
you can conceive.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And a successful conception
is your new reality now.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So imagine yourself and
visualize yourself, now,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
in nine months'
or a years' time,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
perhaps just a little
longer or shorter,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:84%
holding your newborn
baby in your arms,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
feeling its tiny hands wrapped
around one of your fingers.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Do this now whilst I'm
quiet for a moment.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And now that your baby has
been conceived in your mind

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and that you believe
this process will happen,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you can allow your
conscious thinking mind

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to forget whatever
it is that you

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
need to forget as these
suggestions merge and weave

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper level
and prepare your body

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to receive what you
need in order to achieve

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:90%
a successful conception.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm
going to count from 1 to 5

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, feeling

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:84%
confident knowing
that whatever happens

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
you have the resources within
you now to cope and to manage

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:90%
with any situation.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Bringing back with you, now,
all the wonderful new feelings.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:90%
