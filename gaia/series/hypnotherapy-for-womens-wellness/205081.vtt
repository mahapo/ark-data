00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
the House of Wellbeing.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:10%
In our "Women's Wellness Guided
Meditation and Hypnotheraypy"

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:10%
series, you'll
find audios to help

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:10%
you deal with all kinds
of different issues,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:10%
including falling pregnant,
managing pain, and having

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:10%
a positive birth experience,
as well as coping

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:10%
with a menopause,
period discomfort,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:10%
and premenstrual syndrome.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.804 align:middle line:10%
All of our audios are slightly
different to just meditation

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:10%
alone because we use
powerful therapeutic tools,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:10%
including cognitive
behavioral therapy,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:10%
neurolinguistic therapy,
visualization, and of course,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:10%
hypnotherapy.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.115 align:middle line:84%
And it's the combination of
all those tools put together.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
That means that
our audios are so

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
powerful in getting rid of
any negative thinking patterns

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.518 align:middle line:84%
and replacing them with
positive, empowering changes.

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And that state is
really familiar to you.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
state of relaxation

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:90%
you go into as you fall asleep.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really natural
state to be into,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:90%
and it's really safe as well.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
lovely relaxed state,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
your brainwaves change into
the threat of brainwave state.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's important because it
means that any messaging will

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
bypass your conscious
mind and instead

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:90%
go into your subconscious mind.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:10%
The reason we want to access
your subconscious mind

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:10%
is because that's where your
permanent thoughts, beliefs,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:10%
habits, and memories live.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
So by talking directly to
your subconscious mind,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:10%
we're able to make real changes.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We can reframe, rewire,
and retrain your mind

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate any of those
negative thinking patterns

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and instead replace with
empowering positive changes

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:90%
once and for all.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you listen to
our audios at least four times.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
In that way, you're
able to override

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
any of those negative
thinking patterns

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and really compound the
positivity again and again

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and really make those changes.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be creating
new positive neural

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:10%
pathways within your mind
each time you do that.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's really important.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.117 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to our audios
at any time of day or night.

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But we suggest that
you listen to them

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
when you're not too tired.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fall into a
deep, deep state of sleep,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
then your subconscious mind
just won't be listening.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So do make sure that you're
listening to our audios

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're free from
any distractions.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to them when
you're actively doing anything

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
like driving or
operating machinery.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's an
emergency and you need

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to come out of hypnosis
before we awaken you,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely fine.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.545 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will allow you

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So it will be just like waking
up from a nap or from a sleep.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So have a good look
through the series.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
click on any audio you think

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is relevant to you.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable position
where you can relax

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and let go, whether
it's a bed or a chair,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and close your eyes to begin.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:90%
