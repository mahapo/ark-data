00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the
managing pain hypnotherapy

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.317 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure
that wherever you're

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
listening to this audio, you in
a safe and comfortable place.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.003 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and enjoy
all those peaceful feelings

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits that
come from this audio.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine that
you're in a beautiful garden,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.465 align:middle line:84%
with colorful flowers and
immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.275 align:middle line:90%
And there's a cool breeze.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You're calm and relaxed here.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.885 align:middle line:90%
And you feel safe and secure.

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle
walk around the garden

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.485 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you get nearer, you can
smell their beautiful fragrant

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%
scent.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:90%
The colors are magnificent.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And they grow brighter
as you approach them.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And now take in another
long, deep breath.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich fragrance scent,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.715 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And it has a golden sound.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Like a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft
powdery sand beneath your feet.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.135 align:middle line:84%
And you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:90%
roll in and out, again.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:90%
One after the other.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Gentle, rhythmic waves
rolling towards the beach

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and back out, again.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently
shines down on you,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
with a warm sea air
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
sinking further into the sand.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Leaving a delicate footprint
behind you as you walk onwards.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing deeper and deeper
with every step you take.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink deeper than

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:90%
before into the wet sand.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.275 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles.

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the
water with every wave that

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%
rolls in and back out, again.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:90%
you walk back up the beach.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lovely deck
chair waiting just for you

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:90%
on the sand under an umbrella.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Offering just the
right amount of shade.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat and
you relax deeply now.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath and take

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea, again.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And you notice the sky.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.685 align:middle line:84%
A clear blue sky,
without a cloud in it.

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
to imagine a staircase.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful staircase with
polished, ornate banister

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
running down alongside
a deep, rich carpet

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps
leading gently down.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.505 align:middle line:84%
10 steps leading
gently down and down.

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:90%
into deep relaxation.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Giving you access to that
powerful subconscious.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Allowing you to
make those changes

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.985 align:middle line:90%
that you want to make today.

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.501 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to one.

00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.728 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Nine, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Eight, more and
more relaxed now.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Sinking even further
into relaxation.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Seven, deeply comfortable.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Feeling every muscle release
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.113 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.113 --> 00:10:05.913 align:middle line:90%
Six.

00:10:05.913 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Five, even further into your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Four, allowing
your mind and body

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to fully relax as you sink
further into deep relaxation.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Three, comfortable, heavy.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Any tension completely gone now.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Two, almost at the bottom now.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Just one more step to go.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And one, going deeper and
deeper down now to hypnosis.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
All the way down to that
deeper healthier level of mine.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Deeper than you've ever been.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the banister.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You let go of any
worries or concerns.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed, and at peace.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
that ordinary everyday wall

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away further
and further away now.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
As you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
mind still fully
alert and aware,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
but you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you know to keep that
sense of relaxation with you.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Feeling safe and secure now.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And just for a moment, I'd
like you to focus on the pain

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:90%
that you've been experiencing.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
All pain, no matter
how pain originated,

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
is comprised of some
muscle tension component.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the natural tendency
of the body is to hold

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.385 align:middle line:84%
the painful part
rigid and still.

00:12:51.385 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And whilst that may
help, it may also

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:90%
contribute to one kind of pain.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:84%
With some pain, there is often
more tension than with others.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So by relaxing as
you are right now,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll find yourself much more
comfortable, much more at ease.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more you listen to
this audio, the more comfort

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.005 align:middle line:90%
you'll find from it.

00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It's actually your
brain that tells you

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
how much pain you're
in and how to react

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
to the sensations in your body.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to help
your mind to send

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
different signals so your
body can become much more

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.101 align:middle line:90%
comfortable.

00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You have a gateway at
the base of your spine.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in pain, the
impulses from pain receptors

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
travel through the
gate into your brain.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Telling you that you're in pain.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.405 align:middle line:84%
But we're now going to
gently close that gate.

00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
See that gate at the base of
your spine gently closing.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Firmly closing shut now.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
That means that
those pain receptors

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:90%
can't get to your brain.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And your brain can't
send out those signals.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel much more
confident, much more ease, much

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
more relaxed from now
on knowing and feeling

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
that gate is firmly shut now.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to think of
your sensations or discomfort

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:90%
as a color.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps a deep blue or purple.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps your favorite color.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Now imagine that color.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see that color
each time you breathe out.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing out tension
and pain in the form of a vapor,

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.755 align:middle line:90%
the color of your tension.

00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:84%
With each breath
you take, you're

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
breathing in comfort
and relaxation.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And with every
exhalation, you're

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.475 align:middle line:84%
blowing away some of the tension
in the form of that color.

00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And as that color, that
vapor leaves your body,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
so does the pain
you feel inside.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in peace and comfort.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And exhaling tension
and discomfort and pain

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
in that color.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
See that color
leaving your body now.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Drifting away each time.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Feeling more and more
comfortable as you

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
exhale that vapor, that
color leaving your body.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Discomfort leaving
your body now.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, you use
your breathing techniques

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:90%
to help push the pain way.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in for four,
holding for four.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Slowly breathing out for six.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
out, remember

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
it's that tension leaving your
body in that color, that vapor.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in for four, holding
for four, and exhaling for six.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Breathing out that color.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Breathing out that tension,
that pain, or discomfort.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.949 align:middle line:84%
Feeling comfort and harmony
and warmth and peace.

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:90%
Remember the gateway is closed.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Signals aren't able
to get to your brain.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
Feeling much more comfortable
now because the gate

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.889 align:middle line:90%
is firmly shut.

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine
that in the corner of the room

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:90%
is bucket of ice.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk
over to the bucket,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
you slowly place your
hand in the bucket of ice.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it's
your left or your right hand.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
You put your hand in the
water and feel how cold it is.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It's freezing cold, but
you leave your hand there.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%
As you do, you slowly feel your
hand getting colder and colder.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Your muscles and nerves
starting to become numb now.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hurt you at all.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Just a numbing sensation.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
You feel calm and relaxed.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Just numbing your hand.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to lose
sensation in your nerve endings

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
as the numbness
reaches your wrist.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not uncomfortable,
but you can feel

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
your hand beginning to go numb.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Nerve endings losing
all sensation now.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.165 align:middle line:84%
Your hand is feeling
cool and tingly.

00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The numbness of the hand
is called hypnoanesthesia.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And now that you can produce
that numbness in your hand,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you can use it wherever
your body needs it.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you feel
pain or discomfort.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So from now on in, when
there's pain in your body,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:90%
you close your eyes.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that your hand is
back in that ice cold bucket.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.085 align:middle line:90%
Numbing sensations in your hand.

00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And you simply touch
your icy cold, numb hand

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:90%
to the area that needs it.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Where your pain is.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be numbing
that area, too.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And that part of your body
losing all sensation now.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Becoming cold and tingly.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Nerve endings losing
their sensations.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
You remember that feeling.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you experience that
sensation whenever you want to.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.280 align:middle line:84%
You're now able to transfer
that numbness at will and spread

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that numbness to any
part of your body.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.365 align:middle line:84%
Making you feel much more
comfortable and much more ease.

00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
ready, you can simply

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
allow your hand to
return back to normal,

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
but the feelings
of comfort remain.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
The more you listen
to this audio,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the more you're teaching your
mind to ease any sensations.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Through breathing out
tension, breathing out

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:90%
that color of tension.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Closing that gateway,
stopping those pain signals.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, numbing
the area of pain.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to feel
so much more comfortable.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to notice
that you have more energy.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel happier.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Feel much more in
control as you know

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
how to manage any sensations
calmly and quickly.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.832 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%

to awaken you.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five,
you'll be wide awake.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Fully refreshed, alert,
and feeling fantastic.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Feeling confident.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%

whatever happens, you

Eyes open when you're ready.
