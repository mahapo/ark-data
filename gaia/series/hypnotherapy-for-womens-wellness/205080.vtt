00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to House of Wellbeing.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
premenstrual tension MindTALK

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.643 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.128 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax, and let go,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
In this deep and special
sleep, your subconscious mind,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
for your safekeeping
monitors everything

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:90%
that's happening around you.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So these suggestions, because
they're for your benefit,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.865 align:middle line:84%
go directly to your subconscious
mind, where they're accepted.

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts
become established,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
firmly fixed deeply in
your inner mind, embedded.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So these suggestions
remain with you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
long after you open
your eyes, helping

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
you to change those
things you want

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:90%
to change for your own sake.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And these new forms
help you begin to change

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.245 align:middle line:90%
the things you want to change.

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And these changes allow you to
enjoy your life more and more.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
imagine that you're

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
checking your body to ensure
you become totally relaxed.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
As your muscles relax, just
let your mind relax also.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Beginning with your
feet, feel your toes.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Stretch them, and feel
the texture of what

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:90%
your feet are resting on.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.075 align:middle line:84%
And now, begin to
tighten your calves.

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And allow them to relax now.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Allow that relaxation to
spread past your ankles,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.265 align:middle line:84%
up your calves, to the
back of your knees.

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And feel those muscles
easing, resting comfortably.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the large muscles of
your thighs, pull them tight.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.075 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of those
large muscles tensing.

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, relax those muscle.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Feel them lengthen
resting comfortably.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Feel your legs as they sink even
deeper as you relax even more.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And notice how rhythmic
your breathing is becoming.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, your stomach muscles,
pull them together gently.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, let them expand
and relax comfortably.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders and
the back muscles.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Flex your shoulders.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.395 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
pull across your back.

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, let your
shoulder slouch

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:90%
as you relax the muscles.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And notice how your spine
sinks deeper into your chair

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
as you relax even more deeply.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.385 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy and regular
your breathing has become.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, your finger tips and
fingers, clench them now.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.495 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And now, allow them to relax.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation
to spread up your arms,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to your neck.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And make sure your neck is
comfortable with your head

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:90%
in an easy position.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Tighten up your neck muscles.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, let those
columns of muscles

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
loosen as the muscles relax
and you allow your neck

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to sink into the cushions
into a comfortable position.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Your facial muscles are flat
and stretched comfortably

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:90%
across your face.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.885 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze up your face.

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:18.685 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, relax those
muscles and feel

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
the lengthening and softening,
relaxing more than ever before.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
You can now feel the air
temperature against your skin.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And it feels smooth
and comfortable.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can
allow the relaxation

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to spread onto your skull,
knowing that you relax

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
throughout your body,
from the top of your head

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.355 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Your body is now loose, and
limp, and heavy, and relaxed.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Notice how your body
is sinking deeper

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation
as your breathing

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.305 align:middle line:90%
becomes more regular and easy.

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'll
count slowly from 1 to 10.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And with each number, you
drift deeper and deeper

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:90%
into peaceful relaxation.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Now feeling deeply relaxed.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And you find it easy to
focus your attention.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine
things very clearly.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
standing on a balcony,
which has steps leading down

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.455 align:middle line:90%
to a beautiful garden.

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
into that garden,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you see it surrounded
with lovely trees,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
ensuring the garden is private,
secluded, and peaceful.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
There are flower beds
set in the lovely lawn.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And further along
is a waterfall,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.175 align:middle line:90%
flowing into a stream.

00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
sound of the water.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
As you look around
you, you see the trees.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And you hear a faint sound
of a bird in the distance.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Adding to the feeling
of deep relaxation

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:90%
through your entire being.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look more
closely, you'll see

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that there are five
steps leading down

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to the garden and
then a small path that

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:90%
leads to the waterfall.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, we'll
walk down the steps.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And with each step, you
go deeper and deeper

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
As you put your foot
on the first step,

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you feel yourself going
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Down onto the second step.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
As you feel your foot
firmly placed onto the step,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
you feel a wonderful relief
as you drift even deeper

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation now.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Down onto the third step.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Feeling wonderfully
free and so, so relaxed.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
As your foot reaches
for the fourth step,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:84%
another wave of relaxation
drifts through your whole body.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Down onto the fifth step now.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.605 align:middle line:84%
Feeling even more deeply
relaxed than ever before.

00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And now as you find yourself
standing on the lawn,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:90%
you see a little way ahead.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
A waterfall.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.975 align:middle line:84%
And you listen to the water
as it gently splashes.

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You can notice the birds singing
in the distance and the sound

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of the trees gently swaying.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And a little to the side is
a comfortable garden bed.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.004 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
color of the bench.

00:11:50.004 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'd like
you to walk over to the bench

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and sit down on the bench
and now you sit down

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and you surprised at just
how comfortable it is

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
even more relaxed.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
As you sit down on the bench,
you take a deep breath.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
feel a wave of relaxation

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:90%
go through your whole body.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing every
muscle, every now.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe in, you
breathe in positive thoughts.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
breathe out negative thoughts,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
leaving room for more positive
thoughts on this journey ahead.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to use your
wonderful, rich imagination now

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a control
room of your mind.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So create a mental
image now in your mind.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Worth knowing which appears.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.615 align:middle line:84%
You just allow that
feeling to develop.

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So in your mind, imagine now
that in front of you is a door.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It may be a white
door, or a wooden door,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:90%
or even a glass door.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't matter.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine whatever
is right for you.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
reach out for the door handle

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and just feel your hand
on the door handle now.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And it feels cool against your
palm as you open the door.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:84%
The door to the control
room of your mind.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now walking
into the control room,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're suddenly surrounded
by panels of switches,

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and buttons, and knobs,
and colored lights

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of different shapes and sizes.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
higher control room,

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
which can be reached
by climbing five steps,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and the door is closed.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You climb the steps to the
higher control room now,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
and you push open the door.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You're now in a similar
room to the one below.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But here, it's much more like
a laboratory with rows and rows

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of taps and tubes carefully
labeled and pushed

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:90%
into alphabetical order.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:90%
All very organized.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And you look around until you
find the letter P and a round

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
dome.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And you notice now in very
large print of the words,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:90%
premenstrual tension.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And just think about
those words for a moment

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and what the words
PMT mean in your life.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, PMT causes
you to become angry.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, it gives
you mood swings.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it makes you feel
low or anxious at times.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps, it's even
unreasonable and irrational

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
about things when
normally, you aren't.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you
notice that the dial

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:90%
is turned up way too high.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
The dial on the word,
premenstrual tension,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
is turned all the
way up to the top.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know you need
to turn down the dial.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So just gently take hold
of the dial right now,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and slowly begin to turn the
dial down one notch at a time.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And feel or hear it click
as it turns down your desire

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:90%
to be in absolute control.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So right now, turn it down to
a much more acceptable level.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
A level that you
instinctively know

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is right, allowing you
to feel in control.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So just gently
ease back the dial

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:84%
to a much more
comfortable level.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Feeling a sense of
relief now of being

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
able to go with the flow to
adjusting to changes in life.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Turning down your PMT and
being much more in control,

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:90%
allowing hormones to adjust.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.815 align:middle line:84%
Taking in a deep breath
and letting it out slowly.

00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know that by being
in this calming state,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
you're allowing your hormones
to settle and to regulate.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you're much more
able to be relaxed in life.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And far less likely to lose
control of your emotions

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.505 align:middle line:84%
at the time of your
menstrual period.

00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, amazing
things begin to happen.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals in your
brain become regulated,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a warm inner
glow deep within you.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:90%
And you can really feel it now.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
You can feel and experience
that warm inner glow.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Small at first, but then
spreading within your body.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to
find that now every month,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
you are much more relaxed
than you've ever been before

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
in your monthly cycle.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to relax,
your mind becomes clearer.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.125 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so calm
inside and in control.

00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And your real personality
starts to shine through.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:84%
How you feel the
majority of the time,

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
feeling normal
throughout the month.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to
feel more relaxed,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
you automatically feel happier.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Happier in general and much
more relaxed to laugh at life,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.145 align:middle line:90%
to feel lighter.

00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
To be able to laugh
at yourself sometimes.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this frees you
up to have fun.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And others enjoy your company
for the wonderful person

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So every month, you simply
adjust that switch in a way

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious
mind automatically knows

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:90%
is correct for you.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, you
soon begin to notice

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that you feel more relaxed
and calm than you ever have

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
before in your monthly period.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And you feel in control in
a much more flexible way.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can scan your body
for any chemical imbalance

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that may have contributed
to your mood swings.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know that there's
an area in your brain, which

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
controls the hormones and how
urothelial body can gently

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.935 align:middle line:84%
persuade those hormones to
balance much more evenly.

00:19:30.935 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:84%
All higher vibrations can
influence the lower ones

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.050 align:middle line:90%
in a positive, healthy way.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.015 align:middle line:84%
Helping them to function
with one another.

00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So go deeper now, taking
another deep breath.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You are free.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:90%
You are in control.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Hear those words in your mind.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And repeat in your
mind, I can be free.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.215 align:middle line:90%
I can be in control.

00:20:10.215 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
You may want to practice saying
those words in different ways,

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
placing emphasis
on different words.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Listening to them spoken
by a different voice.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you like hearing my
voice in your mind saying,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.945 align:middle line:90%
I can be free, I'm in control.

00:20:28.945 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps in the past, your
personality may have changed.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
How you gave in to
your moods and felt bad

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:90%
for the next few days.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:90%
But this time, you're prepared.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
your body needs

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:90%
to balance those hormones.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
You know you can dial down
your PMT in your control room.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
so should you notice
any change no matter

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
how slight you now
know you're in control

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.465 align:middle line:84%
and you repeat
yourself, I can be free.

00:21:04.465 --> 00:21:05.265 align:middle line:90%
I am in control.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can be free.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Free from discomfort.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Free from those mood swings.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Free from any negative thoughts,
or feelings, or emotions.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You are free, and
you're in control.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Notice at first how
much calmer you are.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So calm, and so relaxed,
and at peace with yourself.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And the calmness extends
and radiates out from you.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And you surprise the
people around you

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
with your newfound
ability to relax.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.185 align:middle line:84%
To feel good in the lead-up
to your monthly period.

00:21:49.185 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And you really don't need
those old premenstrual symptoms

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:90%
You're free.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Free from the old you.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:90%
The happy you.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
In control, always
rational and reasonable.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with one,
two, three, four, and five.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Allow your eyes to
open when you're ready.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:90%
