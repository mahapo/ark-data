00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Hypnobirthing Hypnotherapy

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure you're in
a safe and comfortable place,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the peaceful feelings and
benefits that come with it.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.165 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.039 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you get nearer, you can
smell that beautiful fragrant

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
scent.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And now taking another
long, deep breath,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and as you inhale the
rich fragrance in,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.395 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale, gently now.

00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.115 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and it has a golden sand,
like a fine powder underfoot.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.835 align:middle line:84%
and you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one after
the other, gentle, rhythmic

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with a warm sea air

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.285 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.245 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you walk back up the beach,
and there's a lovely deck chair

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
waiting just for you on
the sand under an umbrella,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
offering just the
right amount of shade.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat, and
you relax deeply now.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath, and take

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.255 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the sky, a clear,
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:84%
with polished ornate
banister running down

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep
rich carpet that

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.065 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:07:55.065 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.225 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.715 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.208 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to 1.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:19.414 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Ten, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Nine, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Eight, more and
more relaxed now,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
sinking even further
into relaxation.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Seven, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.805 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:09:58.805 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Six, five, even further into
your deep state of relaxation

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Four, allowing
your mind and body

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to fully relax as you sink
further into deep relaxation.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:32.005 align:middle line:84%
Three, comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Two, almost at the bottom now--

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:90%
just one more step to go.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And one, going deeper
and deeper down now

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.705 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
that ordinary everyday world

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
As you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
mind still fully
alert and aware,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
but you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're in
this deeply relaxed state,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
we're going to focus
on your feelings

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:90%
about the birth of your baby.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.832 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you
to see yourself,

00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
birthing process.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
You're relaxed and happy, and
your baby is soon to arrive.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
As your labor
advances, you go deeper

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:90%
into your sense of relaxation.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper you relax,
the more your muscles

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
can release, allowing your
body to do what it's designed

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:90%
to do with much more comfort.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Each contractional surge will
bring you deeper and deeper,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
allowing your mind to
shut out all distraction

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and to drift into that place
where your body and your baby

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:90%
are working in complete harmony.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Muscles releasing
with this relaxation,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
allowing your muscles to work
together much more comfortably.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
You have the
ability to stay calm

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and relaxed as your
mind is relaxed

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and your body is relaxed.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
You allow yourself
to focus solely

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:90%
on your body and your baby.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You remember to
breathe correctly,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.365 align:middle line:84%
depending on what stage you're
at within the birthing process.

00:14:00.365 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and
out, between your surges,

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
between your contractions,
and during your surges,

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
long breaths in,
filling your abdomen,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and long, slow,
gentle breaths out.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Long, steady, powerful
breaths in and out.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Controlled focused breathing.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, long,
deep breaths down

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
when you're birthing, powerful
breaths nudging the baby down

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
further and further with
each downward breath,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:90%
with each expulsive surge.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You trust that your body
knows exactly what to do,

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and you remember that your
body's designed to give birth,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:84%
your muscles working
in complete harmony

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.835 align:middle line:90%
to make birthing easier.

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Remembering your
breathing techniques

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
again in between
your contractions,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:90%
just gentle breaths in and out.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
During your contractions,
long, slow breaths

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in, long, slow breaths out.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you're fully
dilated, and you're birthing,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
long, powerful,
deep breaths down,

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:90%
focusing on down breathing.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Trusting in your body to
know exactly what to do,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
remembering that your body
is designed to give birth.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
listen to this audio,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the more you're practicing
being able to get

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
into this relaxed state
and the more you'll

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
be able to relax during
your labor and birth,

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
allowing the muscles to
work in complete harmony

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
to make birthing much easier.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You have complete
inner calm, and you're

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.065 align:middle line:84%
able to maintain this throughout
every stage of your labor.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You stay focused and
calm on your journey

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.235 align:middle line:84%
to hospital, confident and
excited that your baby is soon

00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:16.035 align:middle line:90%
to arrive.

00:16:16.035 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of the
support around you,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you can
trust in your birthing partner

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to care for you at
this special time.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
You allow each surge,
each contraction

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to take you deeper and deeper,
long, slow breaths in and out.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps to encourage
your cervix to dilate,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:84%
you visualize a flower
opening slowly and gently,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
opening outwards,
just like your cervix,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
one petal at a time, slowly
and gently, one by one,

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.785 align:middle line:90%
wider and wider.

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You allow and understand
that your body is designed

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
to give birth the
way nature intended,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and you trust in your body
to work just as it should.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:84%
You're relaxed and happy that
your baby's coming to you,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to meet
your little one eagerly

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
waiting for you.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
You give yourself time to
rest in between surges,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
meaning you have renewed
energy and stamina for as

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
long as your body needs.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
By breathing deeply, as
you've been practicing,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll be providing your baby
with plenty of healthy oxygen.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Your body will
know when the time

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is right to move, breathe,
and rest, and provide

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.025 align:middle line:84%
just the right
support for your baby.

00:17:59.025 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Each surge having a purpose,
each surge taking you deeper,

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
each surge bringing
your baby closer to you,

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:84%
you allow yourself to drift
off into your special place

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
in the quiet of your mind, your
special safe, private place

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
where you feel comfortable,
deeply relaxed and at ease.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
you've made preparations

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
so that your muscles
are soft and flexible,

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
pliable and loose,
meaning your baby emerges

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
smoothly and easily, just
as you've visualized.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
You trust in your body
to know what to do.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:84%
You visualize your cervix
opening like a flower,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
gently opening outward,
getting larger and larger,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:84%
gently opening, allowing
your baby to ease down.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You've chosen to birth in the
most calm, serene, and natural

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:90%
way that you can imagine.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And your imagination is more
present now than ever before.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And you see your
birthing play out now.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, see your cervix opening
more and more, wider and wider,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
opening the way to a
gentle fluid calm birth,

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
just like a flower with the
petals opening wider and wider,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
getting larger and larger,
allowing plenty of room

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:90%
for your baby to emerge.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
In this very deep
state of relaxation,

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
your body releases
endorphins much more easily,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
releasing, breathing with each
slow downward breath, your body

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
slowly and gradually opening the
way to a welcoming birth path.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident,
safe, and secure.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You see your baby
positioned perfectly

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
for a gentle, comfortable
birth, and your baby

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
emerges easily and gently, and
you're excited and confident.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:84%
As a result of this birth
preparation experience,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
you feel much more
confident now.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You feel mentally and
physically prepared and excited

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.565 align:middle line:84%
that your special day
is soon to arrive.

00:20:38.565 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You're positive and optimistic
about the birth of your baby,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and every day, your nerves
become stronger and steadier.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling
strong and empowered

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward to
a wonderful, calm, safe,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and gentle birth.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now
with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:90%
