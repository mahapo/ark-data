00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.255 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Menopause Mind Talk Audio.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
powerful, hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and enjoy

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible, and listen

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.725 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.575 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.745 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs as much as
you can, and let it out slowly.

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in a long, slow
breath, and when you're ready,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:90%
let it out slowly.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can allow
your breathing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal,
gentle breaths in and out,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.005 align:middle line:84%
returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.015 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.772 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:03.775 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.295 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.418 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten
out as they relax,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and you let go completely.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.985 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and happy.

00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders, all the way down

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.595 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.935 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, move that warm light
across and into the chest area,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy down

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, move the light from
the sun down your right leg,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes, and you let go.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:90%
into your life leg.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg from the top of the hips

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your
toes, and your left leg

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.359 align:middle line:84%
relaxes, releasing tension,
letting go now completely.

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.875 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd like you to
use your imagination,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.175 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.405 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.785 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:50.585 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
are listening more and more,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with a beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself, you're

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
going to a very special
place, a place where

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create
some positive, wonderful,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.355 align:middle line:90%
long-lasting changes.

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.865 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:90%
10, 9, deeper and deeper still.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Eight.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Seven, all the way
down to relaxation now.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
3, 2, all the way
down, deeply relaxed.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And now as you begin
to drift deeper

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
into the wonderful feeling of
calm and total tranquility,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to feel your body
working once more in harmony

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
with your mind, because
for a while now,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
you've been experiencing some
of the symptoms of menopause.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And although you're aware that
this is a natural transition

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that your body is
going through, you've

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
also been in discord with your
emotions and the chemicals that

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:90%
have been changing at this time.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But that's all
changing now, because

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
with the use of hypnosis
and creative visualization,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to regain
control of those emotions

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals, not
because I say so,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
but because you really want
to feel better and enjoy

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
your life and your
health and fill it

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:90%
with meaning and purpose again.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
In studies conducted,
reports show

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that women who participated
in organized relaxation

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
saw a 30% decrease in their hot
flashes and a significant drop

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
in tension, anxiety,
and even depression.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They also reported fewer mood
swings and much more stable

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:90%
emotions overall.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is, as you
lie here relaxing today,

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you help to reduce the
small stresses in your life

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
by simply setting aside
some time every day now

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:90%
to relax and unwind.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
You make sure your mind and
body are in a relaxed state

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to help reduce the
effects of the menopause.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
There may be occasional
times after listening

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to this audio when you feel
as though those old menopause

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
symptoms are returning,
but with the use

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
of the self-hypnotic technique,
which you're about to learn,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to make
those symptoms less and less

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
frequent and so much
easier to cope with,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
until, eventually,
in a very short time,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
they simply disappear
altogether by themselves.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself to
drift further down

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
into that calm and
peaceful feeling

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
as you listen to my
voice and my voice only.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Outside sounds or movements can
just dissolve into nothingness

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
as you become
oblivious to everything

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
except for this
wonderful feeling

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're beginning
to experience now.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms of menopause
can vary from woman to woman,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
but the reason for those
symptoms, as you already know,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
are the variations and the
release of chemicals, mainly

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
the hormones, estrogen
and progesterone, that

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
are produced in your
ovaries and regulated

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
by your pituitary gland
found in your brain.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to see or
sense yourself, as you will,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:84%
as someone who is
totally in control

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.225 align:middle line:84%
of the regulation of those
productions of hormones.

00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Visualize now what
this looks like,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
the productive system
of those warnings.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you visualize it
like a network of switches.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's multiple times.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be, look
at them now, and see how,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
firstly, your estrogen
and progesterone levels

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:90%
are registered way too low.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
See the dial or switch, and
visualize yourself putting it

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:84%
at the right level,
doing whatever

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
needs to be done to fix the
problem once and for all,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body to find
the right level of estrogen

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and progesterone,
finding the right balance

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
with your hormones to make you
feel like your old self again.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, find the dial or
switch for adjusting

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
the flow of capillaries
to your skin that make you

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:90%
feel hot and flushed at times.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So now, imagine yourself
adjusting the control

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to actually make you
feel hot and flushed,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like you to
adjust the control,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
but this time, in the
opposite direction

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel cooler
and much more comfortable.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, it's almost
as though a lovely, cool breeze

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is wafting over your
face and your neck now,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
a cool and comforting
breeze that

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:84%
begins to spread throughout
your entire body, making you

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
feel good once more.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Feel it now blowing over you.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.905 align:middle line:84%
You can now feel that
wonderful, wonderful breeze.

00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you're standing
outside on an autumn

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
evening, perhaps a little rain
in the air wetting your skin

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and cooling you down.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
What can also make
everything seem worse

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:90%
is the lack of sleep.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So in future, should
you ever begin

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to experience those old feelings
associated with hot flashes

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
or night sweats, I want you
to find a comfortable place

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to relax and breathe
slowly and shut your eyes,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and visualize yourself outside
in that autumnal evening

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with the rain and cool
breeze washing over you,

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
coolness spreading
throughout your whole body.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get
better sleep, you're

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
also avoiding hot and spicy
foods as well as caffeine,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:84%
at least several
hours before bedtime.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You also have a desire
to naturally increase

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the estrogen in your
body as you start

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:90%
to think about the food you eat.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you introduce soy
beans or flax sesame seeds

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
into your diet, as well
as apricots, oranges,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:84%
strawberries, peaches, many
dried fruits, carrots, kale,

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
celery, dark rye bread,
lentils, peas, olives,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:90%
olive oil, and chickpeas.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
You think about those foods and
how they increase your health.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So go back to your
network or dials

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
now, and readjust other
symptoms you may be feeling,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
such as forgetfulness
or changing weight,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.605 align:middle line:90%
chills, and mood swings.

00:22:12.605 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Look at the dial, and
gradually go along each one,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and change the
setting to something

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that suits you to a feeling
that you want to achieve.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Reset exactly how you want to
feel as you take back control.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a minute
now to readjust each setting.

00:22:41.315 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you find that
your sleep is improving day

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
by day.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
You go to bed at a good
time, and you wake up

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
feeling that you've had a
well rested and full night's

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
sleep, feeling
rejuvenated and refreshed.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Your body temperature
stays the same all night,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as you feel cool, calm,
and relaxed, waking up

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
in the morning having slept
through the whole night

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:90%
easily, peacefully, and calm.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and in control.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You think much more positively
as you feel your hormones

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
balancing in your body, making
you feel more relaxed and calm.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Your memory is
increasing day by day.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
When information is read
or taken into your brain,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:90%
it's retained.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It stays put.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
You remember exactly
what you need

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to remember as your memory's
fresh, sharp, just like it

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:90%
was when you were younger.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and in control.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
You think much more positively
as you feel your hormones

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
balancing in your body,
making you feel much more calm

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Your hot flashes have decreased
more and more each day.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
As you use the techniques
we've learned today,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
closing your eyes,
imagining yourself

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
outside in the rain with a cool
breeze whenever you need to.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.195 align:middle line:84%
Long, deep breaths as you
visualize that cool breeze.

00:24:49.195 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And you also use that technique
to control your night sweats,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and you sleep a long, well
rested sleep with your body

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:84%
temperature staying
at a normal rate,

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
never increasing, just
staying exactly where you've

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:90%
put the dial.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and much more

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
in control.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You think much more positively,
as you feel your hormones

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
balancing in your
body, making you feel

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:90%
much more relaxed and calm.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
As your hormones
balance out, you

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:84%
find, in turn, your
mood swings level out.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You start to think
much more rationally

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
about situations, challenges,
and daily occurrences

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.895 align:middle line:84%
in your life, instead
of thinking emotionally

00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:52.695 align:middle line:90%
about things.

00:25:52.695 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
You know that life
is good, and you

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to be
grateful for, a lot

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to be thankful for, and
you begin to appreciate

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the small things in your life,
the beauty of the world you

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
live in, your
friends and family,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
having a roof over your head,
all helping to lift your mood

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and make you smile
more frequently.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and in control.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.220 align:middle line:84%
You think much more positively,
because you feel your hormones

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
balancing in your body, making
you feel more relaxed and calm.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:84%
You regain control
of your weight

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
by making some
changes to your diet.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:84%
If you've increased
weight, you make

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
sure you cut down on
your sugar, and you

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
manage your portion sizes, and
you eat much more healthily.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you've lost
weight, you ensure

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you eat three
healthy meals a day

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and include healthy
snacks in between.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that you
exercise regularly,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this will help
keep you at the right weight

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and help you
emotionally by making

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
you feel happier and healthier.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and in control,

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and you think much
more positively

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
as you feel your hormones
balancing in your body,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
making you feel more
relaxed and calm.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.485 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you
feel fully in control.

00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You know you can listen to
this audio as many times

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
as you need to, knowing that
you can reset your hormone

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
symptoms each and
every time you listen,

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
helping you to
rebalance your hormones,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.120 align:middle line:84%
take back control, and
feel much more comfortable

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.395 align:middle line:90%
within your mind and body.

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.745 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier, more
confident, and in control.

00:28:09.745 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You think much more positively
as you feel your hormones

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
balancing in your body, making
you feel more relaxed and calm.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and they become more
and more powerful

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one up to five

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to awaken you, and
at the count of five,

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll be wide awake,
fully refreshed, alert,

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:90%
with a wonderful new feeling.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now with one,
two, three, four, and five.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
