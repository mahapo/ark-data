Around 90% of menstruating women get advance warning of an approaching period because of physical and/or psychological changes in the days before their period starts. For most women the symptoms are mild, but many find their symptoms so severe that they dread this time of the month. About a third of women say PMS significantly affects their life and that they feel like a different person at this time of the month. So in this session we will help you remain in control of your hormonal fluctuations and to stop dreading your monthly cycle as you take back control and embrace this time with confidence and calm. We recommend that you listen to our session at least four times so you can really compound the positive messaging, override the old beliefs and help your mind create new neural pathways to managing premenstrual syndrome symptoms. \n","teaser":"This Premenstrual Syndrome meditation & hypnotherapy session is aimed for people who suffer from Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and need help managing and controlling it.
