00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Period-Pain Hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So please, be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and comfortable
place, free from distractions,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
where you can fully
relax and let go.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.299 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy all those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take
in a very deep breath

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
slowly inhaling, filling
your lower and upper lungs,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done that,
I'd like you, once again,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
to take in a deep breath,
filling your lungs.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release as you
exhale gently and powerfully.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal, your
normal breathing pace--

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
gentle breaths in and out,
as you normally would.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
as I refer to it in turn.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.075 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And now as you allow those
muscles to relax and release,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
every nerve, every fiber
in your hands, your wrists,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
and fingers, arms--

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
allow that tension
to flow away now,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to drain down, allowing the
muscles to rest and release.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Lengthen and loosen.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.864 align:middle line:84%
aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of attention
to fade away now,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.821 align:middle line:84%
as you drift deeper into
relaxation, muscles loosening

00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and lengthening as the muscles
relax and release now, legs

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
feeling heavy as you
release completely.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower-back muscles,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
loosening and lengthening
as each muscle releases

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
as you sink into relaxation.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.665 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles
in your neck and scalp,

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
aware of the tension
here, and now, you

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
can release that
tension as every muscle

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
in this part of your body
becomes more and more

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
relaxed so that you can
feel each and every muscle

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
in your body now
loose and limp as

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
that comfortable
heaviness continues now.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in your entire body's
completely relaxed

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.785 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So 1, your entire body's
completely released now,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
every muscle, every
nerve, and every fiber

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
relaxed and at ease, your entire
body feeling completely relaxed

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and comfortably heavy now, and
to your head feeling so heavy

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and you feel safe and
secure, and you're

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
enjoying this state
of deep relaxation

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're now deeper than
you've ever been, so deeply

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that every
word I utter to you

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper--

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Now that you are in a
deeply relaxed state,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.375 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about menstrual pains.

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
those are feelings

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
when your uterus or womb
contract to shed its lining.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite amazing, but for
some, it can be very painful.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So today, I'm going
to guide you and help

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you find ways to loosen up
those muscles, to aid that pain

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.415 align:middle line:84%
relief and give you
a lot more comfort.

00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you start by
exercising and stretching more,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:84%
as you know that this
loosens up your muscles

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.405 align:middle line:84%
and helps to provide the
period pain relief needed.

00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've tried
rubbing your lower

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
tummy to relax the muscles,
helping to ease the pain,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.245 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps taking a warm bath,
or finding a hot-water bottle.

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You know that heat
goes a long way

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to reducing the effects
of your menstrual pains.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You know that all pain, no
matter how the pain originated,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
is comprised of some
muscle-tension component

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
because the natural
tendency of the body

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.335 align:middle line:84%
is to hold the painful
part rigid and still.

00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And whilst that may
help, at the same time,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
it will also contribute
to some sort of pain.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So by relaxing, as
you are right now,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll find yourself much more
comfortable, much more at ease.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And the more you listen to
this audio, the more comfort

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.482 align:middle line:90%
you'll find from it.

00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to think of a
painful sensation or discomfort

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:90%
in your body as a color.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a deep
blue or a purple.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that's your
favorite color.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:90%
But it represents discomfort.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Now that color that
you've imagined--

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine that
each time you have a pain,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
you're breathing out tension,
you're breathing out discomfort

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a vapor,
the color of your tension.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
With each breath
you take, you're

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
breathing in comfort
and relaxation.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And with every
exhalation, you're

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
blowing away some
of that tension

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.375 align:middle line:90%
in the form of this vapor.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
As the vapor leaves
your body, so, too,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.005 align:middle line:90%
does the pain you feel inside.

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And as it drifts away
each time, you're

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
left feeling more and
more comfortable, more

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:90%
and more relaxed.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you want to try
a breathing technique

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
to help push the pain
way, breathing in

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
for four, holding for four, and
slowly breathing out for six.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you breath out
for six, the tension

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
leaves your body in the
color vapor you imagine.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's do this
now, breathing in

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
for four, hold for
four, and out for six,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
feeling peace, comfort,
harmony, and warmth now.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You also know that the
more we focus on discomfit,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:90%
the more discomfort we feel.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So one of the best tools you
have is to distract yourself.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine yourself
in a special place of safety

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
and comfort.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You no longer focus
on the discomfort.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you take yourself
away to the special place

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of safety and comfort.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's in a bed
on Sunday morning,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
either by yourself or
perhaps with a partner.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe wrapped up
warm in a heavy blanket,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
cozy and safe,
comfortable, and at ease.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you feel
happier, more comfortable,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
more at ease in a beautiful
garden or in the sunshine.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Have a think now as to where
your special place of comfort

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:90%
may be.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Try to make it as
real as possible.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:90%
What can you hear?

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
What can you smell?

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Who's with you?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.435 align:middle line:90%
What can you touch?

00:14:05.435 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Create this lovely, safe,
comfortable place now

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And every time you feel any
sensations or discomfort,

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
take yourself off

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to this special place
of safety, no longer

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
focusing on any discomfort,
instead, distracting your mind,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
going off to your special
place of safety and comfort.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd also like you to start
practicing placing your thumb

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and forefinger together
each time you take yourself

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to your special
place of comfort.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
This technique is
called anchoring.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
We want to anchor the feelings
of calmness and relaxation

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.820 align:middle line:84%
when you think of
that special place

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.085 align:middle line:84%
by touching your thumb
and forefinger together.

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice
this, the more

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a
conditioned response

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to this action of
thumb and finger

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
so that after a few
times of repeating

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
this action with your beautiful,
detailed visualization,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
you generate a
conditioned response.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
You've formed an
association now.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You immediately
feel the emotions

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
of calm, peace, and comfort
when you place your thumb

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and forefinger
together, giving you

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
immediate relief, immediate
easing of any menstrual pain

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
or sensations, relaxing your
body, relaxing your muscles,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
allowing any pain to wash
over you, to flow over you now

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
as you breathe
through it, perhaps

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:90%
using the 4-6 technique.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Remembering that the more you
practice placing your thumb

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and forefinger together
whilst visualizing

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
your special place of
safety, the more you're

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:90%
compounding that anchoring.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You're building
that association so

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that every time you feel
discomfort, all you have to do

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is place your thumb and
forefinger together,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and all the feelings of calm and
relaxation come flooding back.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
This may take practice,
but after doing

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
this just a few
times, you'll start

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:90%
to build that association.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice
that technique,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
compounding that anchoring,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.105 align:middle line:84%
compounding those feelings
of calm and comfort.

00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
listen to this session,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
teaching your mind

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to ease any sensations
through breathing out

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
tension and numbing
the area of pain,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to feel
so much more comfortable.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You notice you have
much more energy,

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
you feel happier, feel
much more in control,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
as you know how to manage any
sensations calmly and quickly.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Each time your
cycle comes again,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
you feel more in control,
much more relaxed, calm

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and confident that you
can manage your pain,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
get on with your day,
live a normal life,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and have the tools
you need to relax,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
letting your muscles lengthen
and listen, breathing out pain

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:90%
easily and effectively.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one up to five

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, feeling confident,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
knowing that
whatever happens, you

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
have the resources within
you now to cope and manage

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
with any situation,
bringing back now

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
all the wonderful new feelings
with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:90%
