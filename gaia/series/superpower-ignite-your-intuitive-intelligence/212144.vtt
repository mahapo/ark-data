>> You are an intuitive being.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
That is your birthright

>> Every single one
of us has intuition.

Everyone's intuitive.

Everyone's empathic.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:10%
Most people just
don't listen to it

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:10%
because they don't know
that your intuition is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
like your soul's whisper.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It's sort of like if you
got a brand new car and it came

used any of the accessories.

Same thing here with people

>> Intuition means connecting
with our higher self

and receiving divine messages,
receiving wisdom, inspiration,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:10%
healing, receiving answers to
our questions and concerns.

realizing that the spiritual
is inside the physical.

It's always been
inside the physical.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't been
looking for it.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We've been looking for
it out there somewhere.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's not, it's right here.

about that day when you met

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:10%
or your wife, someone who is
incredibly important to you.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meet my
love of my life today,

I'm going to meet
my best friend?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
No, we were going about
our ordinary business,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
buying our coffee in the
same place we always do.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Or we just happened to go to
some event or party or workshop

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, you just
sit next to somebody

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and you smile and you
just like them right away.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
There's this
sweetness or this buzz

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
between you or this connection.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And it just brings you into
such a beautiful, warm place.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And even though you don't
know any of the details

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
about that person, you
love them right away.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
What makes that so?

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
What moves your
life magnetically

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to that person in that
moment at that time

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:90%
at that point in your path?

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's as if that there's
this force that knows

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.390 align:middle line:90%
what we need better than we do.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Master intuitive,
what does that mean?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, master
intuitive is that I just,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I experience a lot of clarity.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, so a lot
of people get lost

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
in what people call the monkey
mind or the chattering mind.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that in my head.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
talk in my head.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't get stuck in my head.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I only receive intuition.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for me to
know how to navigate myself

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
through life.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Or when I'm helping
someone, I could

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
see what to say without
giving my own opinion or bias.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.222 align:middle line:84%
It's really just what
comes to me through source,

00:03:37.222 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it
source, if you want to call it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
your higher self.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The more open my heart
is, the more available I am

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:10%
to what's going on around me
and the more I know what people

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.785 align:middle line:10%
need.

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:10%
I guess another way
of thinking about it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.055 align:middle line:10%
is what is the intuition for?

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:53.118 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
I have not yet

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
been gifted with the
ability to know what's

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the future.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
My intuition tends to be
more like therapeutic.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, I know what people need
emotionally, therapeutically.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The work that we're here
to do is all about identifying

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
your unique gifts and bringing
them forward and leveraging

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
them to bring a little
bit of Heaven to Earth,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to be in service to others, to
be in service to your own soul,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:90%
to also give and receive--

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
and notice I say receive--

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
give and receive as much
compassion as humanly possible.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And that takes a leap
of faith, unless you

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:90%
tap into your intuition.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You tap into your intuition,
and all of a sudden,

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
there's no longer any faith or
trust required, it simply is.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at those places where
you do things that people think

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
are awesome, but that you
tend to dismiss as trivial.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We think that because
something is easy for us,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
we don't deserve credit for it.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the easier
something is for us,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the
more credit we deserve,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
but the more attention
that deserves.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
That's where your
gift often lies.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So be extra attentive
to those things you

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%
do that are super easy for you.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Because that's magic.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think our intuitive stuff
is really a deep survival

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:90%
skill.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Survival might be
natural, right?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:10%
Going to sleep is natural.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:10%
What do you do when
you go to sleep?

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
You say, gee, I'm tired,
I think I'll go to sleep.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's your intention.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you let
go of the intent.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And you probably think of
something else and fall asleep.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But if I said to you, OK, how
about we put you on TV tonight.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
10 million people
will be watching.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you $1 million if you
can fall asleep in 20 minutes.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:90%
You think you could do it?

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So here's a natural
thing, but now

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
we've loaded it with
self-consciousness, pressure,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:90%
efforting.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when people say
I don't have intuition,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
usually it's because that brain
is so active, that they haven't

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
quieted down, they haven't
opened up their feeling centers

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:90%
enough to be able to detect it.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything that you do
to enhance and practice with

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:10%
your spiritual abilities
has a cumulative impact.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
It all stacks up.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It all adds up.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to the gym.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking the stairs
instead of the elevator.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea with becoming more
intuitive or becoming a master

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:10%
intuitive, if we want
to use those words,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:10%
is I imagine it like an
equalizer on a sound board

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:10%
where you have your intuition's
voice and your thinking voice,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:10%
your limited mind.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And every time you
get that intuitive

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:10%
hit, when you listen to it,
when you choose to act on it,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:10%
you're giving energy to it.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.532 align:middle line:84%
So you're turning the
volume up on your intuition

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're turning the volume
down on the limited mind.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.212 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do that,
eventually you get to a point

00:06:56.212 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
where there's no
voice in your head.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no talking and
it's just empty space.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And all you receive
is intuitive thought.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
our mind is designed

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to be an empty space for our
heart's intuition, our heart's

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.215 align:middle line:84%
visions, just like
when we were a child.

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we were a child,
we didn't have the monkey mind.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see clearly all of
the pros and cons of a decision

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to make.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
You might get a flash,
an insight, a picture.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Just a really simple thing--

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
the other day I had
a picture of myself.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm at home.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
But I had a picture
of looking up

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
at the marquee at the
airport or whatever,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, they put the time
that the flights are going,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:90%
and I saw the word delayed.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just a really quick
little flash of "delayed."

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And so then I take
a pause and go,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, was that just monkey
mind, me imagining,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
oh my flight the next day
is going to be delayed?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Or was that a true
intuitive hit or an insight?

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
How I know that was
an intuitive insight

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
is that it came in unexpected,
it came in very clear.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:90%
It came in neutral.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:90%
There was no excitement.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:90%
There was no fear or anxiety.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:90%
It simply was.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:90%
So I took it very seriously.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the next
day, I checked on the flight.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:90%
It was delayed.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Why did I get that insight?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:90%
But I'll take it.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Opening up your intuition
is stepping into a higher level

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You are literally becoming
aware of more things.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
But it's not everything.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:10%
And there's a trap for
professionals like me

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:10%
who can fetishize our
own intuitive abilities

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:10%
and delusionally
believe that makes us,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:10%
like, gurus or something,
when in reality we just

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:10%
have this one extra capacity.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I have
intuition thus I am a master.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I have intuition
and that's real.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'm even a
master of intuition,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
make me all knowing.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
That just makes me really
good at this thing.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We only have two emotional
states, if you think about it,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
We have ones that
make us feel heavier

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.988 align:middle line:84%
and ones that make
us feel lighter.

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:08.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Whenever we're in a
heavier emotional state,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:10%
that means that whatever we're
perceiving is not complete.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:10%
It's off in some way.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing
the full picture.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.247 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like if
you're looking through blinds

00:09:19.247 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
but the blinds aren't
completely open.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're just seeing
part of the picture.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.145 align:middle line:84%
So you might be
getting a little chunk.

00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in a lighter
emotional state, passion, joy,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
creativity, excitement,
love, inspiration, clarity,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:84%
then you're seeing clearly
from your light body,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:90%
as you might want to call it.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
There is the la-la-land
effect, you know,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
where you meet someone
and you're on cloud nine

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're kind of caught up
in the fantasy of your mind.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, did you
get swayed off of your center?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're just
in this blissful bubble,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
chances are it'll get
popped at some point.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.968 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
living in a bubble.

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And some people want to enjoy
the bubble, and that's OK, too.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It really just depends
where you're coming from.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's having the ability to
get back into your center

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and being like, OK, let me
just look at things clearly.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, yes, this is
an amazing person

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:90%
and I'm so excited about them.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's be over here,
let's be where my intuition

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
lives, if that's your choice.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I still experience emotion.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love emotions.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:90%
But it feels more spirited.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, the emotions
that I experience

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
don't take control of me.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I could feel emotions
without becoming my emotions.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
mastery point.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
become their emotions.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
When they're angry,
they become enraged.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's that blind rage.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, where
the idea is to be

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
able to feel your emotions
without having any judgment

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or resistance to them,
kind of like a dog.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:84%
When you see a dog who is upset,
and dogs feel emotions, right?

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:90%
They're sad.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But how quickly can that dog
go from sad to happy, right?

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
That's because dogs
don't dwell in it.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.145 align:middle line:84%
They don't judge themselves
for their emotions.

00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't resist
their emotions.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They just allow it
to flow through them,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
to the next thing.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're a great
example of how

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
we can learn to better operate
with our emotions in that way.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I was dating a woman
years ago and we

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
were coming towards the
end of our relationship.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And we were fighting a lot.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.995 align:middle line:84%
We were just not
in a good place.

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
She had my keys,
for whatever reason.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had a client
that was coming,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
so I was like, make
sure you come home

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
straight after work because
I need the keys for my client

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:90%
to come in.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, yeah, yeah.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And intuitively I knew
she wasn't going to do it.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But I was just like, in my head,
I was like, she better do it,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And sure enough,
she didn't show up.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
For three hours I could
not get a hold of her,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and so I was getting pissed.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just got to the
point where I was just,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:90%
how could she do this?

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:90%
That's so insensitive.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And all these other
reasons that came up,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.878 align:middle line:84%
only to find out
three hours later,

00:11:55.878 --> 00:11:57.795 align:middle line:84%
she was right down the
street and she was just

00:11:57.795 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
ignoring my calls.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Logically, if I were to
think with the logical mind,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I have every reason in
the world to be angry.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
She said she was
going to do this.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And I could justify every
reason why to be angry.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm just
justifying my heavy state,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
which that's not the goal.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
stay in a heavy state.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And so with the interest of
practicing what I preach,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.233 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, in
some way I'm wrong.

00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
In some way, there's
something I'm not seeing.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine how
I could possibly

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
be wrong in this situation
or misperceiving something

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's very clear that she
just didn't do certain things.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:90%
But let me own it.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped, I took a second,
and I took full responsibility

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:90%
for the emotion.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I said,
"what am I not seeing,"

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:84%
my intuition gave me a download
and immediately what I saw was

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
she's been doing this for
months and months and months.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And you keep choosing
to take her back.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you're
enabling it and not

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:90%
taking full responsibility.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So that only happened because
I realized in the heavy state

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.553 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
I'm not seeing.

00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the ways that we

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
could learn to work
with our superpowers

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
with our intuition
to be masters of it.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:10%
>> What I encourage people to
do is to really explore what

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:10%
brings them into
their deepest center,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:10%
something that helps them
drop out of their mind,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:10%
deeper into their direct felt
experience and helps them

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:10%
to ground in that which
is deeper than their mind.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:10%
So for me and for most people,
that's some kind of meditation.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The most important
thing about meditation is

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
effortlessness,
comfort, just relaxing.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:10%
People think that they
have to do something,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:10%
that meditation is hard, that
they have to control the mind,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:10%
that they have to
blank the mind.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:10%
All these ideas about meditation
are completely erroneous.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The pace of life I think
is really out of step with

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
what's natural and what's good
for our social, relational,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:90%
spiritual well-being.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think we all need to
find some practice that we

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:84%
can do every day to have
some spiritual musculature so

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have a chance to
respond rather than react.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The easiest way to meditate
and to begin to develop

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
your intuition is to
just sit down in a chair,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:90%
close your eyes.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
You take maybe three really
deep breaths like this.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
You can breathe out through
either the nose or the mouth,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But always breathing in through
the nose because the nose

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:90%
is designed to take in air.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%

that you can come back

to in the midst of the day.

important to help you get

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:90%
into that quiet, peaceful state.

>> One of my prayers that
I share with people is,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:10%
"May I ground in the infinite
source so that I can stabilize

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:10%
there and open my heart to
all that arises and become

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:10%
a deeper, more noble,
wiser, kinder human being."

>> It's like Jean-Luc Picard in
"Star Trek" saying, "Engage."

I always picture him.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I picture
him and think, engage.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And instead of, I don't
have to do like 15 or 20

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
minutes of meditation or
anything, it's like a keyword,

or you're having
a conflict at work

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:10%
and you want to know
how to solve that.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask that question and
then take another deep breath

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:90%
and completely let go.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And be neutral, have a neutral
attitude, but open to receive.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the answer
will occur to you.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It will just pop into your mind.

>> I ask students to keep a
diary of the insights that they

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%

what's the outcome.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, I don't want
to write all that stuff down.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't
want to do the work?

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't do the work.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But don't come and
complain to me.

There is no magic

you to turn on your intuition.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to do the work.

So once they start keeping
a log of what happens,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and whether they
followed it or not

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and what the outcome was,
over a period of a few weeks,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
they can look back and
see patterns and trends

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:90%
and how this is happening.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel it this way.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Not beat themselves
up for not trusting

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive
insight, but just use

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
it as a key learning
for next time.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
This is work.

necessarily something you even

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
have to do with your

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, you could
be washing the dishes.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:10%
You could live in
a meditative state.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
For me, meditation
is simply presence.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.675 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot like goosebumps.

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you can
do to make it happen,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%
but you can notice when it does.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
I find that a lot of people
struggle with meditation

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.432 align:middle line:84%
simply because it's
not engaging enough.

00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not because they
suck at meditation.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not because, oh,
I can't quiet my mind.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding a
way to make meditation

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
engaging for you so you really
thoroughly enjoy the process.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I like creating really
passionate, playful,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
creative meditations
that same way

when you're watching a movie.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching
a boring movie,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be talking
in your head the whole time.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.187 align:middle line:84%
But if you're engaged in
it, you're present with it.

00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:90%
That's like meditation.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's about creating
an engaging meditation.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, you could do
that by slowing down.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You could breathe at 12
o'clock, as I like to say,

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
which is breathing right
up your center over there.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.595 align:middle line:84%
And that'll start
to slow you down.

00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get more
present with your spirit.

>> Meditating for 20 years in
an ashram never appealed to me.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:10%
I was in a monastery when I
was 14 for two years in silence

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:10%

my shtick this lifetime.

to quiet that mind.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Binaural beats, it's an
old technology that dates back

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:90%
to the 1830s.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:90%
The idea is really simple.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:10%
So if you're wearing
a set of headphones

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:10%
and you put 100hz into
one ear and you put 104hz

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.333 align:middle line:10%
into the other ear, the brain
tries to equalize the two.

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, it should be
hearing the same thing.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it can't because
they're inherently different.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
unique structure

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that says,
oh, if I'm hearing this

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hearing that
and they're different,

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:90%
it will set up a third tone.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So the third tone is the
difference between the two.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So 100, 104, so it sets up
a third tone, which is 4.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
That tone, which
doesn't exist anywhere

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:84%
except inside the
brain, creates a beat.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that, it
sounds kind of like wah,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:90%
wah, wah, wah.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The whole brain starts to
resonate with that third tone.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
4, as an instance, it's in the
delta range, which is sleep.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you just did those
two tones and the brain

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
starts to follow along, we
call it the frequency following

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
follow along at 4.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:90%
And you would go to sleep.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll introduce 4, and
then we'll introduce 14.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So now you have your body is
deeply relaxed and asleep.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And your mind is bright,
awake, and clear.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The cool thing is that
you don't have to have

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:90%
the tones after a while.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You do it a couple of times
and you go, oh, yeah, I

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%

like and feels like.

It would be difficult.
But if somebody

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
started playing the waltz, we
could catch the rhythm, right?

The hemi-sync binaural beat

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:90%
this is what you want.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And fairly easily, if your
intention is to relax,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
you could relax or to open
your heart or be creative

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%

you wanted to go.

My brother committed suicide
back about 25 or six years ago.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And I got the call
from the police.

died under this circumstance.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
on guard.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And I can see that with my eyes.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
What people are watching is
not me conceptually seeing you

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and making sense of it,
it's me feeling what I feel

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and sharing it.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And before every reading,
I take off this necklace

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
because I use this necklace
to kind of protect myself from

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:90%
people's energy.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And so now I want the opposite.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just
take it off here.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The way my empathic
abilities work

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
is that I find myself
feeling what is going on

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:90%
with another person.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I feel people in layers.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:10%
Like, I can feel what
somebody is feeling

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:10%
right now in this moment.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:10%
And then I can dig
beyond that into what's

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:10%
going on with their
life generally

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:10%
at this point in time.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if I
really concentrate,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I can feel into what are the
driving emotions of their life.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, can I have your left hand?

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Face down.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I often just know what's
going on with a person.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if a fragment of
my consciousness, to the extent

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that I have an
independent consciousness,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
goes off and travels
into the other person

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and then comes back to
me with information.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind likes fancy.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.545 align:middle line:90%
The heart speaks simple.

00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I'm
speaking with my grandmother,

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I love my grandmother.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was living with her,
I would have people come in

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
for psychic sessions.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I would give them the
readings and transformations

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.553 align:middle line:84%
She's very curious
without being judgmental.

00:23:38.553 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret
sauce, you know?

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.928 align:middle line:10%
Because if you're coming
at me with a judgment,

00:23:41.928 --> 00:23:43.711 align:middle line:10%
I don't even want to
explain it to you.

00:23:43.711 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:10%
But she genuinely
wants to understand.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:10%
She's like, what are
you doing, you know?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
you're helping somebody?

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I were to be fancy
with her and I were to say,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, I'm psychic
and I get messages

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:84%
from their spirit guides and
that gives them information.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:90%
That's more for me.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That's me wanting her
to believe in my world.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't need her to
understand my language.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
She's asking a question, and
so she's looking for a clarity.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I just tell her
is, I'm like, I feel people

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel the
truth inside of them.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And I reflect it
back to them in a way

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that they can see
and feel it too

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and that causes
changes in their lives.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.025 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, oh,
that's really smart.

00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:25.825 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:24:25.825 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Start with how you're
feeling right now,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
which is apprehensive,
guarded would be another word.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I feel all this
pressure in my head

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:90%
that isn't mine, that's you.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel you trying to
make sense of the situation.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You're in your head and
you're spinning in there.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling
other people's stuff,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes really
hard to know what's yours

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and what's theirs.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's the challenge.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's just
embrace that challenge.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not always going
to know, and that's OK.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
You're learning.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I meet a lot of people
who are very high empathy.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:10%
They're sort of like sponges,
that wherever they go,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:10%
they will take on other
people's feelings and emotions

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:10%
and experiences and wear
it in their auric field

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:10%
as though it is their own.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:10%
>> People are becoming
ultra sensitive now

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:10%
because of the high
frequency energy,

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:10%
which means often very empathic.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:10%
And then people are
like, I'm overwhelmed,

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to feel all this.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how--

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there are skills for
developing that and working

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
with it, you know,
to keep you sane.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> One way I have gotten better
at distinguishing what's mine

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:10%
from what's not mine is to
get really good at knowing

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:10%
what's mine.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:10%
So I am often checking
in, how am I feeling?

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
What's really
going on inside me?

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
The more clear I am about
my own energy, feelings,

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
what have you, the easier
it is for me to know, wait,

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't feel like me.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.347 align:middle line:90%
That has a different quality.

00:26:09.347 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the first
things I do is ask them,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
do you help a lot of people?

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And they say yeah.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, do
you ask people what

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
help they need from you
before you offer it?

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I just figure out
what they need and I jump in

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and I do it.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I've got to tell
you something clairvoyantly,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can take this
or you can leave it,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
but by just jumping
in and helping

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not taking
care of yourself.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And you may not be doing exactly
what they need at that moment.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:84%
You can expend a lot less energy
just by being a good listener.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, that's going to
catch up with them to where

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not intuitive anymore.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
All I sense now is need,
need, need from people.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's because you've cut
off how you treat yourself.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You are trying to be
precise and get things right.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's taking a lot of
effort to get things right

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't yet
found a flow with anything.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
know how else to deal

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:84%
with things other than to
try to figure them out.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it can
get overwhelming.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you even
get headaches sometimes

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
with that approach.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
below the surface,

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:90%
the feelings are a lot of fear.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
If the fear had a voice,
it would say is this OK?

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Is this OK?

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do feel
like it's OK, you can relax.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this very
natural way of connecting.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
You also, like I
can, feel what's

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
really going on with people, if
you feel calm and comfortable

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and you're very loving.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't feel calm and
you're in the state of fear,

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
then that loving
quality gives way

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to this hyperactivity
where you're just

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure it out.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:90%
How can I get this done?

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:90%
How can I solve this problem?

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And you oscillate
between these two states

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of feeling open and caring and
feeling nervous and hyperactive

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of mental chatter.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> We're very social creatures.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're in fear,
that's contagious, too.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:10%
Watch what you're thinking
and who you hang out

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:10%
with because it will tend to
influence how you're feeling.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But if one person who's in a
deep, deep, wonderful peaceful

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.930 align:middle line:84%
place, I think, can set
the tone for many hundreds

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:90%
of other folks.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Underneath this fear is
a frustration, even a rage,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't yet found
any space for itself.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
The frustration
or rage would say

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:84%
something like, why do I
have to do it this way?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Why is it like this?

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Why am I forced into this?

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>> If the insights that
are coming to you are based

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:10%
in anger or retribution,
revenge, or paranoia--

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:10%
that one's plotting against
me, this one's after my job

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:10%
or whatever--

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:10%
those are the insights you
need to examine very, very

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:10%
carefully.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not coming
in a helpful, hopeful,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:90%
healing framework.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:84%
If the insights that you get are
helpful, hopeful, and healing,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't you
want to trust them?

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You're trying to figure
out how to fit into things.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
When I was your age, I also
was trying to figure out

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:90%
how to fit into things.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But underneath that, there's
some deep essential part of you

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't want to
fit in and it just

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
wants to do things the way
you would want to do them.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't had time or
space yet or enough safety

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to be able to go there.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
anger around that.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:10%
If I'm resonating with
you on some level,

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.700 align:middle line:10%
you're probably already using
your empathic abilities.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.650 align:middle line:10%
We're using them all the time.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:10%
We're using them
to tune into people

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:10%
we're around to make
them feel more safe.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We have an intuition
about what people need.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the thing to
do is just to notice

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
where you're already doing it
and give yourself some credit.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We're not used to getting
credit for being empathetic.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:84%
We're used to getting credit
for coming up with a solution

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:90%
to a problem.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But what if the
best thing we can do

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:84%
is just to be with
someone in the problem.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We tend not to get that
much credit for it,

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:90%
so we can give it to ourselves.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And down there at the
level of the soul,

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
you feel like
somebody who wants to,

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
needs to weave people
together, the kind of person

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:84%
who you want to be in a
group with because you're

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
going to know how
everyone is feeling

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and how to make
everyone feel good,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:84%
like social glue, the
community builder,

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the very gentle and
loving community builder.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I imagine that you're already
playing this role a lot

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:84%
among your friends
and your family.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to validate
that as your superpower,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to encourage you to notice
when you're doing that

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and give yourself
some credit for it.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it might
come very easily.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen
when you feel like you

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:90%
have to get things right.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to go into
this intense, cerebral place

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and your natural gifts
of weaving people

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:90%
together will fall aside.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But as you develop more
and more of that gift,

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
the more that's what
you'll want to do.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:84%
You'll be the one bringing
that peace and connection.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:10%
>> When you establish a
beautiful, meditative field,

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:10%
heart open, grounded
to the Earth,

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:10%
connected to the spirit full
wide so you have a large

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:10%
projection of energy around you,
it tends to influence people.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
They may just say, gee,
every time I talk to you,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel better.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:10%
I come up here to Monroe
Institute often on Friday

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.900 align:middle line:10%
when programs start on Saturday.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Building's completely empty.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And the place is glowing because
people have meditated there

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:90%
all week.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite
of haunted house.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a blessed house.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I consciously do that
to my home in the mountains

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:84%
in North Carolina, where
we extend that energy

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling to have a
beautiful, peaceful place there

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:84%
for the plants to grow well, for
people to feel it very healing.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And that does occur.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I
have for you, Jesse.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to open my eyes.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you pretty much hit
the head of the nail with

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:90%
the hammer right there.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:middle line:84%
That's-- yeah, that's very
accurate to what I'm actually

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
feeling or what I
believe that I'm feeling.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more people are
saying I need to learn about

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:84%
intuition, I want to be
more fulfilled in my life.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Intuition will take you home.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:10%
It's a way to feeling
fully aligned.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:10%
It's a way to feeling
fully in your purpose.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:10%
>> They'll say, I
want to be happy.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:10%
I tell them no, I
can't guarantee that.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:10%
Because happy is
dependent on an outcome.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:10%
I'll be happy when
I get that job.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll be happy when
I finish school.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll be happy when I have
a grandchild finally.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.000 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
depend on an outcome.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's giving away the power.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead of happiness,
shoot for joy.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Just go for joy.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
You can have a joyful moment
at any time, a joyful moment.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Look at this flower
blooming over here.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Look at this nice lady that made
my coffee at the coffee shop

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:90%
today and how she smiled at me.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if she's
having a difficult life,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:84%
but yet she took the time
to smile and be nice to me.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Those moments and
being observant

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:84%
of those moments and
present in those moments

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:90%
create stronger intuition.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start to integrate
those things and bring them

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
in, you'll feel more
and more like yourself.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, if you allow
those things to be your guide,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
you will realize
that you are part

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible
stream of consciousness

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
that just wants to
run through you.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel less
like yourself, but only

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:84%
in the beautiful sense that
you are now part of everything.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Even when you're not
trying to tune into things,

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
if you're taking care of
yourself, if you have prayer,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:54.520 align:middle line:84%
meditation, balance,
centered, good nutrition,

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
drink plenty of water, if you're
as kind to others as you can

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
possibly be, if you're as kind
to yourself as you can possibly

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
be, the intuition
will turn itself on.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Your perception of
where your energy is,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
you could say
feeling pretty good.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.732 align:middle line:84%
That means my
energy is positive.

00:35:11.732 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm feeling really good.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Things are starting to
glow and look beautiful.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting insights.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting more intuition.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And serendipity is happening,
synchronicity is happening.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
That would be a sign of
getting into a higher flow.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Be aware of everyone and
everything, animals, plants,

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.540 align:middle line:90%
people, that are around you.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:90%
See the beauty and see the joy.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:38.395 align:middle line:84%
And listen to the insights
that you get and act on them.
