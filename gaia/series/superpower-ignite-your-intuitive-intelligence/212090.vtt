>> One of the phrases that I
hear a lot is my horse threw me

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:90%
for no reason.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I say to them
is, actually, an animal

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't throw someone
for no reason.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
There's always
something going on.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:84%
My job is to see, first of all,
why did the animal do that?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:10%
Then we build a program
to be able to support

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
both the human and the
animal coming together

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:10%
in how to work with the
situation that we have

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:10%
so it's a win-win for both.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I am an animal
communications counselor,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
which means that I work with
animals and their humans.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm also a medical
intuitive, but for animals.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:10%
So I work under the
auspice of veterinarians.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:90%
What a good girl.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
That means that if you're having
a challenge with your animal,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%
we absolutely ask
the animal directly

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%
why something happened.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Because animals don't do
things, just to do things.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
There's always a reason why.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether we have trained them
inadvertently in our behaviors

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're trying
to get our attention.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But either way, it's
important to know,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.755 align:middle line:90%
and that's where I work.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> We've known her for years.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:90%
We deeply respect her work.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:10%
I think people
really underestimate

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.000 align:middle line:10%
how much our animals can tell
us, if we just really listen.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a value
system that allows

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
us to work in partnership
with our animals.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
We have a deep respect
for their value.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We have a deep respect
for their intelligence.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We always say, take
care of the dogs,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and the dogs will
take care of you.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:90%
- Heaven.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm in heaven.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We were going to make
an amazing service dog.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you are.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> People will say
to me, Miranda,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
my animal is trying
to tell me something,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know what it is.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting
the line, but there's

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of static in
between them and their animal.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I take my shoes
off by the front door.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering why he
walked to the bedroom.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:84%
He grabs one of my
shoes and brings it in.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And then he'll
drop it somewhere.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And when I'm ready
to leave, there's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:10%
usually one shoe,
sometimes, no shoes,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.753 align:middle line:10%
and I have to walk
around looking for him.

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't chew them up.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
He just brings them.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:90%
He'll bring one on the bed.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
When you asked about
why does he pick it up,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:90%
his focus is to protect you.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I ask him,
what does that mean?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:84%
He says, because he
doesn't want to leave

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
your scent that strong, where
someone else can find it.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But then when I ask
him, how about showing

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
your human in the morning
where the shoe is,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:90%
he starts laughing.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
He thinks it's a good
game at that point.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So two levels of what
he gets out of it.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.557 align:middle line:84%
I know most of his
hiding spots now.

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> There's one more thing to it.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when he has it,
and he can breathe into it,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
he actually gets even
more of your scent,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:90%
which is heaven for him.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:90%
You know it's just like, oh.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a scent to him.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the main things that I
teach is to be able to hear.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to empty out.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:10%
You have to make room
to be able to hear.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:10%
So it's all very
good and well to say,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:10%
I want to hear my animal.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:10%
But the question is,
are we actually looking

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:10%
at the culture of that being.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
not understanding

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
the culture of that being, we
are then projecting onto them,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:90%
that they should be more human.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Being able to connect
with those animals

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
requires that we're willing
to open up and look in

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:90%
at a deeper level.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
We take a look at what
stress is in your life.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
We talk about meditation.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We look at co-counseling,
meaning with a partner

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
where you talk
about your feelings

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:84%
about animals you've
had in the past.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that is all
inside of us, too.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes
under the heading

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
of not just I want
to hear my animal,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
but are you clearing
way in yourself

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for hearing animals?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Rio and I are
great companions,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and we travel a lot.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We hunt and fish
and camp and hike.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
But I also am in a program
where I need to attend meetings,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and those meetings are in an
area where an arena or a room

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
with about 35 to 50 people.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And he comes with me,
but he gets nervous.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Which he is now.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Which he is now.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if
there was anything

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I could do to make
him more comfortable.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.974 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the challenges, he
says, is when he's in the room,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
he's very sensitive to the other
people in the room as well.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, they're
all over the place,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and he says he can only do
what he can do with you.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:90%
That's his first line.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But he says, you separate
from him a little bit.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
He's a little confused, as
to whether to follow you

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
into that situation.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
He's not sure if he's supposed
to administer to the others,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.868 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't want any
part of that, frankly.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I can understand that.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.055 align:middle line:84%
>> He's asking me to ask you,
are you supposed to be healing

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.708 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You, personally, supposed
to be healing them.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because he sees you every so
often reaching out to people

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to ground or whatever.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not me healing anybody.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It's everybody.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:90%
They're healing each other.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, it is a lot of
people in one place doing that.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
energy in that room.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Yeah, a lot.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So his focus of what
he wants to say to you,

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:84%
so if you were to ask, is there
anything I can do to help him?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> His focus is that,
that's too much for him.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So he would rather
be sitting with you

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
off a little to the side
or up front or whatever.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he just needs
that energetic separation.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'm
going to pull my leg

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
away just a little bit because
I don't want him to fear.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He says, one of the
reasons he's nervous

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
is that you are a good,
really good pack leader,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
until you start working
with these other people

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:90%
or start whatever.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And then your focus divides.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.496 align:middle line:84%
Your focus not divides
because that infers it's--

00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:07.758 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.280 align:middle line:90%
it's a broader focus.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And then his focus
is, well, I thought

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to follow you,
or I-- so he's questioning,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:90%
is he doing the right thing?

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So he puts himself in
jeopardy about that.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Something to consider
is, if you have a dog,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and you leave your
Dog at home all day,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
and you come home to walk that
dog, what you don't want to do

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is whip out your phone and
start working on your phone

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
while you're walking your dog.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not fair, and
it's not appropriate.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's rude.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Because this being has
waited for you all day,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's only
appropriate that you

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
respect that, being that you
expect to wait in your home,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
not doing what they would
naturally do out in the wild.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come home,
you need to be focused.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:90%
He says people are not focused.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They like to think they
know what they're doing.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
People don't know
what they're doing.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
They act as though they
know what they're doing.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
He's asking me,
why are humans so--

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
my word, scattered.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, well, that's
a really good question.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%
We have that flaw.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.775 align:middle line:90%
And only two legs, I'm saying.

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Archie.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had people ask
me, are you psychic?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:10%
In some ways, I am, but
I'm really more telepathic,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:10%
meaning that I am working
with nonverbal communication

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.085 align:middle line:10%
most of the time.

00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:90%
This cat has lived with you for?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably seven
years, I think?

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and you use him to help
train service dogs to be around

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:90%
cats.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that accurate?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, use would
be a big word.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:10%
He lives with the service
dogs, and he thinks that--

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:10%
I think that he thinks
they're pretty swell.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:84%
It does help them acclimate
to a cat that doesn't run

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So for sure, he does provide
a service to the service dogs.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But I also think
he quite likes them.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we'll see.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
He now has to live
with a Doberman, Tessa.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you let him know that
she wasn't raised with cats?

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's why she's--

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> The way she is.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>> The way she is.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%
She can't help it.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:90%
She's 10 and 1/2.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, hold on.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
He's saying to me,
you're not telling me

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:90%
she's going to stay, right?

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> For a while.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He says she's fast, but
she's not the sharpest knife

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
in the drawer, which
makes her very dangerous.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
All she knows how to do
is react, react, react.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no time for
decision in there.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how can
you live that way?

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's also a
cultural difference.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Cats deal with our
tension very differently.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
They actually do better,
mitigating our tension

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
from their lives,
until they're older.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
not as resistant,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're not as able to
just let it pass through.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But they're better at
withdrawing and ascertaining

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:10%
the human may need
some balancing,

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:10%
but they don't take it on.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:10%
They don't use
themselves as a sponge

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:10%
to mitigate what's
going on with us.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, dogs can have
a tendency to do that.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Horses can have a tendency
to do that as well.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
He wants to give you a rundown
now of what's going on.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
He says that Lear has
been quiet for too long.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Lear would not
admit how much pain he's

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
in because he feels
called to help, as always,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't want to
be missing in action.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But he says he knows that Lear
is going to need more help,

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.785 align:middle line:84%
and he says he, Bliss,
will keep an eye,

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:90%
so you don't have to worry.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
He will keep an eye
on Lear to make sure

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that Lear has what he
needs to be comfortable.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.175 align:middle line:84%
He says, but Lear
needs to slow down.

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Lear is his barn name, but
his fancy name is Liebesprinz,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:90%
prince of love.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
He was a very fancy
show horse, a jumper.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:90%
He's an American Trakehner.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The Trakehners are
a German breed.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
They were originally
from Prussia,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were used
as cavalry horses.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
athletic and very bold,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
but have a good sense of humor.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> He's not sure if he'll
make another winter.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:90%
He's just not sure.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> He says he wish he were
stronger than he is because he

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:90%
feels he could be more support.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But he says, right now,
this is what he can do.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Plenty.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.325 align:middle line:84%
>> When the barometric pressure
changes, weather cold--

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Affects his body?

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> More obviously in the
cold than in the hot.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> He's just not sure that his
body will do enough to warrant

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
his wanting to stay
in a physical body.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But he says, whatever
happens, he's your guy.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> When he fell, did he
fall asleep standing up?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Does he like the shavings?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:90%
To roll in the shavings?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, he says, he hoped
it would bring him more ease

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
in his back.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And it just got too confusing.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
He's not as strong
as he used to be,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
so he couldn't self-correct
fast enough, he's showing me,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
couldn't than yesterday.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember that horses
are prey animals,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
so they are always on alert,
no matter where they are.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:90%
They're on alert.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
They can be relaxed
after a while.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you have your horses
in an area where they're

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
exposed to wildlife, like in
Colorado and just any setting,

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
they're always on alert.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take that
into consideration,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
remembering that the way an
animal, especially a horse,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
sees life is so
different from us.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:10%
We have to join the animal
where they are, and then

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:10%
take it from there, yeah.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, why
would they trust us?

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
He actually is starting
to communicate on his own.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as questions
and things he wants to ask.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that the two
of you share is laughing a lot.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, but you
haven't been laughing.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.967 align:middle line:84%
It concerns him because he
says you have supported him,

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and he has supported
you through everything.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And he wants you to know we
need to laugh no matter what.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he says, that's
what keeps us alive.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.095 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and if you forget,
he will make you remember.

00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:84%
He says, he's
concerned about you.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
He's taking this
opportunity to say to you,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
please walk with
me in the morning.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
He feels that you're
forgetting how

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
to walk with him
in a way that will

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.455 align:middle line:84%
help you release the tension,
the stress that he is feeling.

00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, he's helping to
ground you by walking with you,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
but you need to have
your feet on the Earth

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
because he says that's how he
can get it out of your body

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.845 align:middle line:90%
through your feet.

00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
dogs do is that they're

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:90%
very sensitive to our stress.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:41.455 align:middle line:84%
This is why dogs make amazing
PTSD response service dogs.

00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Please understand,
there's a difference

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
between PTSD response
and emotional support.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Emotional support is
not a service dog.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
However, they are
of great service

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to us because they
comfort us, and they

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
know when we're
uncomfortable and what to do.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Because of our politics
changing so radically,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
there were many people upset
that causes the daily energy

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
Dogs were the first
species that went off

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
in this last four-year period.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Domestic dogs were
very uncertain

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
because they do look
to us, some of us,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:90%
specifically, as pack leaders.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Others of us who are not
as strong as pack leaders,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:90%
still, were in the pack.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
And if the pack starts
weakening that survival,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
so the dogs were
concerned about that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.075 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look at
what is our stress.

00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:10%
He's asking me to tell you,
sometimes, you doubt yourself,

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:10%
and he doesn't want
you to do that.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.048 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:17:46.048 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Never ask an animal a question
that you don't want the answer

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.757 align:middle line:90%
to because they'll tell you.

00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, your
dog is taking you

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:90%
to the woodshed right now.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's understandable.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things he does for me.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They call me the vet
squared because I'm

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%
a veteran and a veterinarian.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the service
from 1966 to 1970.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
At which time, I spent in
Vietnam from '67 to '68.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you mind my asking,
how does he support you?

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> He helps me in several ways.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them is he helps me my
PTSD, where I get to touch him.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Also, I have a very bad back.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:90%
He picks things up for me.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And he gives reassurance
to me when I face issues

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that I push back for a long
time, a long, long, long time.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of the things
that helped me with that.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I've seen animals do
phenomenal healings on humans.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:10%
Cats are absolutely amazing.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:10%
Many times, they will lay
on the part of the body

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:10%
that the human needs healing in.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And the human assumes
it's loving, which it is,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.040 align:middle line:90%
but there's more going on.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Someone came to me and
said, you know, my cat,

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't understand it.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
My cat-- this goes
back maybe 30 years,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
something like that-- can't
understand why my animal is

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%
laying on my chest.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And then checking in with that
cat, that cat said my human

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:90%
has heart problems.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And his heart is not regulated.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
about that comment

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
is that means that
whatever the tempo was

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that the cat was used to
from the human's chest

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:90%
was not repetitive.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So I said that to the man.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't diagnose.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling you what
your cat is sharing with me.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.113 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK.

00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So we went and got
it checked out.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And he had heart
problems big time.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And what's
fascinating, that cat--

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:90%
so he had an in-house doctor.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
He says, sometimes, you
push yourself further.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's my expression
for what he's showing me,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:10%
that you push yourself further
than your physical energy will

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:10%
do.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and then
that gets you into a place

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that he then has to
work really hard.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And he wishes that you would
stop just a little bit sooner.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.357 align:middle line:84%
He says, but sometimes, you're
so focused on what you're

00:20:27.357 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
doing, and you're excited
about what you're doing,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.107 align:middle line:84%
or you're involved
in what you're doing.

00:20:31.107 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
He wishes you knew more about
where it was healthy for you

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:90%
to stop sooner.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.042 align:middle line:90%
Am I saying it clearly?

00:20:37.042 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what he's saying?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, can he help signal me?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, hold on.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> He senses it?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
His question is, will
you pay attention?

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He can smell when your
biochemistry changes way ahead

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
He picks it up and wants to say.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're leaving
or and now we're

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
just going to sit
down and have water.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Or now, we're just
going to dial it back.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He says he's going to do
his best to use his node.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
This is really articulate.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:84%
He's going to do his best to hit
your calf with his nose, just--

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and so at first, I see you--

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that's normal for a dog, or
he's just slamming into me.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:90%
But he'll be looking up at you.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
he's waiting to see,

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
are you getting
this form of intake?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> He does that.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, he's
nudging below my knee.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he wants to
be petted or something.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize he
was signaling me.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I just got you
a raise big time.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> More treats.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, more treats.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Got you a raise.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Birds are very patient with us.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
We think we know all about
them, and we really don't.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They require a certain amount
of flight to be who they are.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And we need to think about that.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have clients
who have birds

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
they dance with so that they can
actually fly on their fingers,

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and they fly in the room.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They'll rent a big space,
just to let their animal fly.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's honoring
who that being is.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> How does he feel about
the motorcycle ride?

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Do I stop often enough?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty hot.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Comfortable?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes, really too hot.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%
He likes it when it's cool.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.925 align:middle line:84%
He loves it, especially when
other dogs see him get out.

00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking him, how does he
feel about moving that fast?

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:90%
He says, it's good.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
He loves the circulation,
the air circulation.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
He says, he also loves the fact
that it's just the two of you.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
He says you only have
two legs, but it's good.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It's good that you do
this because then it's

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:90%
faster than two legs.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's happened that
is stressful for him

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
during the day, he
just comes to life,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.365 align:middle line:84%
if you choose to then let it
out that way, by going riding.

00:23:24.365 --> 00:23:25.165 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:25.165 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you
want to ask him?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm kind of curious how he
got into the feral cat program

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:90%
because that was ridiculous.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
My neighbor wanted a
feral cat for his barn.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
We prepared two
crates in the tack

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:90%
room, covered with blankets.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So when the feral
cat arrived, he

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
would have a safe place to be.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, he called me up the next
day and said, I have the cat.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, we might
not see him for several weeks,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:10%
but we'll have to feed him and
everything, get him acclimated.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when we walked
in the tack room,

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
he was at the
front of the crate.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So we opened up the crate, and
he rubbed against our legs.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, not a feral cat.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, hold on.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'm seeing before this was
that he actually had a home.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
He had people that enjoyed
him, but they fought.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:90%
The humans fought.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it was going to
be OK, but it was too scary.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was
easier to be outside.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
he was scooped up.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't see him being outside
very long, not very long,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:90%
like maybe--

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I keep asking here.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a month, max.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But he also had other
people that we're

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
feeding him, that he would
hide under the porch of.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So he found a way to be safe,
even with all the coyotes.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> He's very savvy, though.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he's very savvy.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his
self-esteem is amazing.

00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:10%
One particular situation
that comes to mind right now

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:10%
is a client of mine who was
a client of mine for quite

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:10%
some time, she and her cat.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:10%
And I was very familiar
with this cat in Texas.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And she called me and said
that she couldn't find her cat.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The cat had not been home
for 24 hours, going on 48.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We were somewhere
in there, maybe 36.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to know, could
I please help in any way?

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I got that this
animal was very close.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe she
couldn't see the animal,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:90%
it was so close.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%
But I said, it's trapped.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, has
someone kept my animal?

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
it's in a structure,

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not seeing someone
as hiding the animal

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:90%
or keeping the animal.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any
humans around at all.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, I don't know.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But that was what-- that
was what I could do.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, I
wish I could tell you.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the best I have.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
She called me back two
hours later, elated,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
because it was her next-door
neighbor's garden shed

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
that had been left open,
and he'd close the door.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And that cat was in there
for almost two entire days

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and so glad to get home and eat.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Those are just
accidents that happen.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a video I want to
show you and then ask you.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, good boy.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I'll race.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
He gets out of the
pool by himself.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:10%
I start swimming,
he'll run alongside me,

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:10%
barking like he's
really mad at me or--

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:10%
>> No, he's tense and very
stressed and his stress,

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:10%
this comes from, he feels it's
not safe for you to be there.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because with
his swimming next to you,

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
you just might as
well have been on you.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And he needs to lose
just a little weight.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
He'll feel better in the pool
when he loses a little weight

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because he's
working really hard,

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:90%
at least from what I'm seeing.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But he's aware of the
fact that once he's out,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
he's now lost all hope
of supporting you.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:90%
For him, it's a nightmare.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:90%
So it makes him crazy.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.122 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>> He chooses to get out.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.067 align:middle line:84%
He likes getting
out on the steps

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and comes in on the
ladder I made him.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you go to a
darker place, which

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.450 align:middle line:90%
is deep, deep water--

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
he knows, it's OK.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a heavy conversation.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you
can try is to spend time

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
with him in the shallow
end inside the pool, so

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:90%
both of you.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're relaxed,
going out ways, and turning

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
right back around, out of
ways, back around, and then

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
a little bit
further, back around.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So that he gets
the idea that to--

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
keep in mind that your
physical presence, when you're

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:84%
in the deep end is
more extreme than when

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:90%
you're in the shallow end.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:84%
He triggers on you, when there's
any physical movement that

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:90%
is extreme.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Now he's seeing you in a
bottomless pit thrashing.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So this may be
something that we could

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
talk further about of
different ways to work with it.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But for right now, we need
to make it safe for him

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
so that he
understands, that's it.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And it can be as simple
as putting a leash on him.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And that when you then swim
out not too far, you have,

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
when you bring him,
you turn right around,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and you turn around,
and you turn around.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But the leash means a lot to
him because you rely on that.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And he relies on
knowing where you

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:90%
are when you're on the leash.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
But he likes swimming with me?

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're in the
water together, we swim.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
He's under my arm,
and I'm stroking and--

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he feels good that he
knows where you are because he

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:90%
can control that much.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But then when he's on the
outside, he doesn't like it.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's just tweaking
on the swimming.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not understanding
where he is,

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
that he has his limits for
how he feels he can help.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he feels insecure.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, he
also thinks you're

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:90%
very brave to keep swimming.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Without him?

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's almost like a cross
purpose there, but he's--

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's a beautiful
relationship the two of you

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, if you're even thinking
about getting another dog,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to fly.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.000 align:middle line:84%
He thinks that the pod,
like we would say the pack,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:90%
needs to stay small.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Another person, OK.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But he can't be responsible
for someone else.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They have to take
care of themselves

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
because he's very
committed to you,

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
he wants to focus.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking him, what do
you see for yourself now?

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
He says, hopefully,
somewhere cooler.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking him--

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, if there's
anything else he wants to say.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.665 align:middle line:84%
And he said, wait, do you want
to talk about the lizards?

00:31:01.665 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to talk
about-- it's interesting

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:10%
because his attitude is,
you've seen one lizard.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.330 align:middle line:10%
You've seen them all.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.398 align:middle line:10%
That's his attitude, not
what is that lizard caring?

00:31:10.398 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:90%
What do they need to say?

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy lizards and all kinds of
life, but he doesn't have time.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't interest him.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Which is not to say that he
is conceited because he's not.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.513 align:middle line:84%
He just, honest to
God, knows who he is.

00:31:26.513 --> 00:31:27.805 align:middle line:90%
>> He has a lot of self-esteem.

00:31:27.805 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, which is great.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is he rolling around
in the dirt all the time?

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Skin is dry.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
He makes it drier
by rolling around,

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's his way of itching.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So we should talk
about what he's eating.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he mind that I wipe
him down with really wet cloth,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
so he doesn't lick it?

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:46.202 --> 00:31:47.035 align:middle line:90%
That's his response.

00:31:47.035 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Why do you have to do that?

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's not shoot the messenger.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- he thinks
that you're playing

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.840 align:middle line:84%
a game that you
think is important,

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:90%
and he doesn't value it.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want him
to eat all that dust.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
No, there's value, just
not from his perspective.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:84%
If you start making yourself
available to your animal,

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that's such a gift.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:84%
The feedback I get,
people are amazed

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.408 align:middle line:84%
that when they come home
from attending the workshop,

00:32:26.408 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
just when they walk
through the door,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:90%
their animals have changed.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Is that true, or is it
that the humans changed,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
more open to, wow.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And now the animal is
going, oh, thank you.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Because now, they
get to be heard.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
