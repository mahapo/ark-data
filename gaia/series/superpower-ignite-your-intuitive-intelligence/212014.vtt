00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%

is that if you imagine yourself

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
in a forest, you know that
straight ahead is paradise.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, logically, to
your thinking mind,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
you're like, "OK, well, I
want to get to paradise.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.587 align:middle line:90%
That's straight ahead.

00:04:57.587 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I should go straight."

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.777 align:middle line:84%
But the intuition has
the bird's eye view

00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and can see that if you
were to go straight,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
you're actually going
to end up at a cliff.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it
communicates that to you

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.328 align:middle line:90%
is it gives you a little hit.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a
feeling of excitement.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a
feeling of adventure.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It gives you good
feelings that would

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.868 align:middle line:90%
be enjoyable to listen to.

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
The thinking mind is going like,
no, I shouldn't go that way.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
That looks like the
long way around.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I should go straight
and you're going

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.472 align:middle line:84%
to end up having to backtrack
and take more time than had you

00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:23.847 align:middle line:84%
just gone to the left where
the intuition was leading you

00:05:23.847 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.098 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has a
sense of intuition.

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of how much
do you choose to listen to it.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.992 align:middle line:10%
>> Intuition is like a big
umbrella for lots of things.

00:05:31.992 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:10%
I like the umbrella analogy,
it's always really good.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:10%
So intuition has
underneath it, things

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.815 align:middle line:10%
like subconscious intuition.

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I subconsciously
hear the thunder

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and I knew it was raining
even though I didn't know,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:90%
that's how I knew.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's subconscious
intuition.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Then there's logical intuition
like you work long enough,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to think
about all the modus ponens

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of
logical structures.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
You just have this logic, oh
that makes logical sense, OK,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It just arises, all the rest is
sort of background information

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
really conscious of.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Then there's things
like precognition

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
which is not logical intuition,
it's not sensory intuition,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not memory
intuition, it's not

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
based on anything that's
available in the present moment

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:90%
as far as we know.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
It's based on
information that seems

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%
to be coming from the future.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:10%

Clairaudience means you're
hearing some subtle message.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not hearing somebody's
voice in the room.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It's actually you're
hearing either words being

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
fed into your mind or you're
hearing perhaps some music,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
some sounds, but nothing
in the environment.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's clairsentience
where you get gut feelings.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You just have a sense, you're
led in a certain direction,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
you're feeling things.

Most people are clairsentient.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:10%
similar to what people talk
about as mystical, as psychic.

And it includes things like

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:10%

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:10%
in science, through
science methodology.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Here's the most ironic
thing about that statement.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Part of the scientific process
is developing a hypothesis.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up with a hunch
that there's a better way

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the most
amazing studies come out

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:10%
of somebody's intuition while
they're having a shower or even

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:10%
a dream or something like that.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Like I dreamt that I need to
do this experiment, it fits in.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The interesting thing
about these things under this

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:10%
umbrella is they all are
separated out by where is

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:10%
the information coming from?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Is it coming from sense?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from logic?

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.273 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming from some
kind of sense of the future

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand?

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it sort of
presumes this idea

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that this is all
happening via exchange

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of information or
reception of information

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%
or processing of information.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean it is, that's

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.555 align:middle line:84%
sort of a way to think about
it that makes sense to people.

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You talk about downloads.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:10%
And I'm wondering
if you can describe

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.945 align:middle line:10%
exactly what that looks like?

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I can talk
about my experience.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about other people.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have varied
ways of receiving information.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to start
first with our state of mind.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
My precognitive
downloads have always

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
come when I'm in a theta
brainwave state, which

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is a light hypnotic state
that we are in as we begin

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:90%
to awaken in the mornings.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You have delta, theta, then
we go into alpha and beta

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:90%
in our busy lives.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's that kind of
half-awake half-sleep state

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
where our egos have
not come in, that is

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
just pure consciousness.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Downloads have
come spontaneously.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I've not thought about
anything beforehand.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
They've just
arrived unannounced.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
They showed me
directions to take

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
or actions that will
be for my benefit.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes just a loving
message like my first one.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:90%
They are very clear.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
They are visceral.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it's like
stepping into time

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and I can actually
feel the experience

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of being in that point in time,
seeing what's taking place,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the experience
of what's happening

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:90%
at that point in time.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, living it
for a few moments.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
They have always had a
very crucial meaning.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They have created turning
points in my life.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And without them, I'm
not sure my mind would

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:90%
have made the best decisions.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
My father seemed to be a
normal, healthy, happy man

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.145 align:middle line:90%
until I was seven years old.

00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:10%
We moved to Seattle where
he went to work for Boeing.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
And he was so excited.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There came a day when my
father was handed a pink slip

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and told, sorry, we're going
to have to lay you off.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It really, really destroyed
his self-confidence,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:90%
his self-image.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
He stayed home every day and
drank and smoked and cursed

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and burped and whatever
around us children,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
while my mother went to work.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Six people on a bank
teller's salary.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So needless to say, our
lives were rather meager.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
My parents really
didn't have friends.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have other
people they spent time with.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It was just the family and
work or whatever for my mom,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and church.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Church was more important
than anything to her,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
it appeared, from
my perspective.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:84%
When I went to her for
advice when I was younger,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.535 align:middle line:84%
she would tell me, "just
pray, honey, just pray."

00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
My father started to drink when
he was a child, like age 12.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
He began to develop a drinking
problem at that young age.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And with time,
full-blown alcoholism.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
After he lost his job,
he became very violent.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
My mother would often go
to work with black eyes.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
She would try to make
up excuses for him

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
like my little brother jabbed
her in the eye or something

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
when he was in bed with her,
something to protect my father.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And with the rest
of us children,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
we learned to walk on eggshells
as we grew up because he

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:90%
was very, very volatile.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
He could fly off and send
someone flying across the room

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.625 align:middle line:84%
or hit your head so
hard you saw stars.

00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
One of my worst memories
was watching my father

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:84%
take a hairbrush to my little
brother who was about 4 or 5

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
at the time and
just systematically

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
beating his little head
as hard as he could with--

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was abuse
with the hairbrush

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:84%
so that he had a little
crewcut at the time

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and there were raised black and
blue welts all over his head.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
His offense was my
little sister was

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
crying so he was going
to punish my brother,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
if that makes sense,
that's what happened.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
When my mother came
home from work,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I still remember her saying,
"oh, John," my father's name

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
was John, "you shouldn't
do that to the children,"

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There was an
unwritten rule where

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.485 align:middle line:84%
you don't talk about what
goes on in the house.

00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't share what goes on.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
outside world, we'd

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
look like a normal happy family,
pretty much, but inwardly,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
it was anything but.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:31.425 align:middle line:84%
By age 9, sexual
abuse began with me.

00:13:31.425 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
After he was finished with
me, he pushed me off the sofa,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember, and
said, "now, go play."

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
About age 10, abuse
was almost daily.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So I would find a way, I'd
maybe just run outside and play

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I could
to get away from him.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And I finally did tell my mom.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, "well, honey, daddy's
just trying to help you."

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And my thought was,
"help me what?"

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:10%
In the summers at my
grandparents' house in Idaho,

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have to cope.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:10%
I played and swam and fished
and ran and hiked and did

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.815 align:middle line:10%
everything my tomboy
heart desired.

00:14:22.815 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a big ponderosa pine
at the beginning of the trail

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:90%
leading down to the lake.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.664 align:middle line:84%
And I could sit under that
what I called my thinking tree.

00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:41.049 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine
what it would feel

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:90%
like never have to go back.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
The still cigarettes
and still alcohol

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid all the
time, I wanted to stay there

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:90%
with my grandparents.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I could never figure out a way.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:84%
The time always came where
we had to get in the car

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and go back.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother one day asked me
to walk down to the mailboxes

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:90%
to get the mail for her.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I think she had two
pieces of mail that day.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking along
the railroad tracks that

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
led to the path to our home.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking balancing
on the railroad tracks

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:90%
like kids always do.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
There seemed to be kind of
like a shimmer, something

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:84%
like in the air
changed in front of me.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And a woman, and she
looked quite old,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:90%
she must have been in her 30s.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I was 12, so she looked old.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
She looked familiar
somehow and she told me,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
she says, "I am an
older version of you.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And I am here with a message.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is to let you know
that you are deeply loved.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that you will make
it through adulthood.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You will live," because that
was my fear that I would not

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:90%
live through my childhood.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined
what I would look

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
like when I became old in my
30s, never entered my mind.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I trusted her and carried
that message in my heart.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I vowed to myself
not to tell anyone

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because people would think I
was a bit loopy, a bit crazy

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to have experienced
something like that.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And so no one else knew.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But in times of challenge
throughout my childhood,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I remembered her message and
it really brought me hope.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I felt warmth and love
within, with that.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.446 align:middle line:90%
And that was my first download.

00:16:55.446 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:10%
>> My family was a great
family, unconditionally loving,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:10%
wonderful, but also
really messed up.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:10%
And I had a borderline
abusive, I would say,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:10%
abusive situation going
on when I was a girl,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:10%
and I've since healed it.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.621 align:middle line:84%
But when this was
happening at nighttime,

00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to go into
it just to not trigger anyone,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
but I would notice that
off to my right hand side--

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
here's my bed and off
to my right hand side,

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
there was a rocking chair.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It was empty usually.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I saw with my mind's eye
an older version, an older

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
woman who at the time I
didn't recognize was myself.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But now that I know
what I look like,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I see that that was
probably myself.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And she would just
be there with me.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.675 align:middle line:90%
And she would just be kind.

00:17:40.675 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And she would say, "you
know what, God loves you.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a frustrating
situation, you're

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
going to be angry at him,
it's OK, you should be angry

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to be OK.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to turn out OK."

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.712 align:middle line:84%
Again and again, she would
just say that kind of stuff.

00:17:53.712 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It was very comforting.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.743 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older, and I
started to go into meditation

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and start to think about this
kind of fabric of time stuff

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
with the move, the flag,
and stuff, I thought,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to take
the flag from the past

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
move it here, and I'm

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.008 align:middle line:84%
going to have a conversation
with my past self.

00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to sit in
that room with that girl

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to tell
her it's going to be OK.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And that it's OK to be angry and
that she's got the right bead

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.875 align:middle line:84%
And that she's going
to turn out fine.

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would do that
over and over again

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
when I had the resources.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I swear,
that was me in that room.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
There's this idea
of the causality

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
going in both directions.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So now you could use as a
mental time travel healing tool

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
this idea that any
time you feel you have

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
an excess experience of
love and you're just feeling

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
so resourced and good and
everything, so mentally go back

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and find a time when you're
not and love that self.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we take what we've seen
so far and make it do something

00:18:58.485 --> 00:18:59.285 align:middle line:90%
that is practical?

00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> There's the results we get
with those kinds of systems,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
it's actually pretty similar
to what we get with this.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we create something which
is a mind matter interaction

00:19:06.885 --> 00:19:07.685 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The theory underneath this
is that photons turn from waves

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
to particles as a result
of being observed.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So can you do that
with your mind alone?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
experiment tests.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:10%
>> So an easy way to describe
it is to make a psychic garage

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:10%
door opener.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.038 align:middle line:10%
You go home and
rather than trying

00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:10%
to find the button to
open the garage door,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.257 align:middle line:10%
you just think
open and it opens.

00:19:30.257 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be
a really silly use

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of
technology because we do

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:90%
have buttons that will do it.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're interested in achieving
things that cannot be done

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
through conventional
technologies.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So I call this a
telegraph from the future.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.153 align:middle line:84%
In initial stages, you wouldn't
be getting like a telephone

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
call from the
future but you might

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
get information, small bits of
information from a future state

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:84%
through a technology
of this type.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
severe challenge

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
given the state of
scientific knowledge,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
like it's pushing
us to push very

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
hard against what we think
we understand and put it

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to the test.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
In many cases,
we're going to fail.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.306 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK, in the process
we might learn something new.

00:20:13.306 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, the third
eye is clear vision.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:10%
That clear vision can
be not only totally

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:10%
now in the present
moment but can also

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.575 align:middle line:10%
have clear vision for
potentially things

00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:10%
that have happened in the
past and also things that

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:10%
are going to happen
in the future,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:10%
and to information, to knowledge
that may not be available

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:10%
if the third eye
isn't open or clear.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, people will
relate to the third eye

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:90%
as the pineal gland.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
reasons why it's

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
related as the pineal
gland is because it's

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:90%
this pinecone-shaped gland.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It's in the middle
of your brain.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
studied it and have

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
shown that there
are what's called

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
piezoelectric crystals in it.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And these are
crystals that actually

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
will emit an electrical
current with stress or strain.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So some people say that
that is the third eye

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because some people see
a clear bright light

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of-- in the
middle of your head somewhere.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
My hypothesis, and I think some
others share this hypothesis,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the space
between the pineal gland

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
gland, and the space

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
between the pineal gland
and the pituitary gland

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
also has the hypothalamus.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And the hypothalamus
is a structure

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that essentially
controls homeostasis, controls

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
balance, releases
important hormones,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and there's also the thalamus.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
So we have the thalamus.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The thalamus is an
incredible structure.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of like--

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I call it like a relay center.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
All our input, all
our sensory input

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
goes to the thalamus and the
thalamus helps filter it.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.855 align:middle line:84%
It helps to send it to the
appropriate parts of the brain.

00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sort of
like-- you sort of see it

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:90%
as this relay center.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
this space that has

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland in the back,
that's got the pituitary gland

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in front, it's got the
hypothalamus on one side,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
it's got the
thalamus, that space

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:90%
is called the third ventricle.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
encasing the energy

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
of all of the pineal gland, the
pituitary, the hypothalamus,

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%
and the thalamus.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
All together as well as
from the center coming up

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the central canal,
coming in with the flow

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of the cerebrospinal fluid
into the third ventricle

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
that happens,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
some sort of alchemical
transformation

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:90%
that occurs there.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
frequencies and vibrations

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of stuff.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I was 15 when I received
my second download.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:90%
It was so horrible, so scary.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was a nightmare.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:10%
But yet it seemed so
real, so like I could feel

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:10%
everything that was happening.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:10%
Two weeks later, that nightmare
began to play out for me.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I had returned home
from high school

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and was standing
at the kitchen sink

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
washing the dishes
from breakfast

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:90%
that everyone had left.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And my father had been home
all day, he'd been drinking,

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and he began calling me
names and shoving me.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing
dishes, for Pete's sake.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking,
gosh, this is

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
what I get for doing
the family dishes.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
He began to shove me and
hit me and pushing me

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
down the hallway where I
ended up flat on my back

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
on the bed in the back bedroom.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
My father's eyes
were like nothing

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd ever witnessed before.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
At this point, he was leaning
over me and slugging my face,

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:90%
hitting me as hard as he could.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Blood was spurting everywhere.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
My nightmare, my vision
was playing out just

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:90%
as I'd seen it two weeks prior.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But the gift of that
vision showed me

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
how to save my own life.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So because I was in track
and my legs were strong,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I pulled my legs
back to my chest

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and let them go right to where
it counts between his legs

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and said exactly what the
vision showed me, "get off me,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
you bastard," which
was the first time

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I ever assaulted my father,
ever used profanity with him.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:90%
He was so stunned.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
He stopped, bent
over to hold himself,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and that gave me just enough
time to run off the bed

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and out the door to a
neighbor's to call the police.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I called my mom to come home
early from work, which she did.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Seeing the evidence, seeing
my face all black and blue

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and bloodied, I think
finally convinced her

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
with a man that we

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be living with.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
She finally left my father.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:84%
She took all four of
us, she rented a home,

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and we stayed with her.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Four of us and my
mom is really great,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't last forever.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.353 align:middle line:84%
My father came around
and next thing we knew,

00:25:18.353 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:90%
she was back with him.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a year later, not very
long that we lived on our own.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It was heaven.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:84%
That was a turning point in my
relationship with my father.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:84%
From then on, he seemed to
have more respect for me.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I can count the
vision as the tool,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the key to saving my life,
showing me what to do.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:90%

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the outstanding
mysteries in science,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
number one is the
origin of the universe,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and number two is the
origin of consciousness.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:10%
It's how is it that
we're aware of anything.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:10%
So from a neuroscience
perspective,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:10%
the assumption is that the
brain is like a computer

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:10%
and somehow the
computer is very fancy

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:10%
and it gives rise to
subjective awareness

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:10%
even though nobody
knows how that could be.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The other assumption
or the other way

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about this is that
consciousness is already here.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's in
everything to some degree.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And the brain then becomes
a very particular kind

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of sensitive organ that can
express it in certain ways.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:10%
>> This consciousness that we
have access to is not limited

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:10%
by time and space.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:10%
It's not limited by
a physical brain.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And why do we keep insisting
on looking inside the head?

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not inside the head.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It may be inside the heart.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I've always found it fascinating
that the ancient Egyptians when

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
they would be mummifying
their pharaohs

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
would pull out the brain and
toss it on the garbage heap

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
but they would
mummify the heart.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They knew something
that we have forgotten.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Clearly you're tapped into a
field that's non-local, right?

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:10%
The assumption
that consciousness

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:10%
is located in your brain or
in some part of your body

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:10%
may be completely erroneous.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Your body may just
be an antenna that's

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
tuned to a certain set
of information that's

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:90%
part of a field, right?

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's your participation
in this field

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that you call consciousness.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Something comes into
my mind that says, oh,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:10%
do this experiment.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so then I do the experiment
because I feel compelled

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.887 align:middle line:84%
to do the experiment, and
then I find out something

00:27:45.887 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's different than
whatever my thoughts were.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's always going to be
more than what's in my head

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because my head is just
part of the universe.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So I have to-- but I have to
be connecting with is something

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:90%
that's bigger than me.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I can say that.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can also say
that it feels good.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.742 align:middle line:84%
I can say that it
feels positive.

00:28:06.742 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
like I'm connecting

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.355 align:middle line:90%
with something that's bad.

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:10%
>> You are in and part of
something so intelligent

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:10%
and loving and ever present
that's always here even

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.630 align:middle line:10%
on a very bad day.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether we want to use
the word God or source

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:10%
or the universe or
life, I don't care.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to use a
God just because God

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:10%
wants to give you everything.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:84%
We are here to live
heaven on Earth,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and life just
wants to serve you.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It just wants to give--
and I don't mean this

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
from a religious
sense whatsoever.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I just mean this is
how reality works.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
It wants to give you everything.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It's paying you to be
here in this incarnation.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like thank you
for coming here,

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
let me give you everything
you want in return.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Max Planck, who is the
father of quantum mechanics,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:10%
was asked in 1931.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:10%
A reporter came up
to him and said,

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:10%
you and Einstein are the most
famous scientists in the world.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:10%
What have you learned?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And his response was,
what I've learned

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is
causal and fundamental.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Space-time arises from
consciousness, not

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:90%
consciousness from space-time.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Defining consciousness is a
big task in that there are many

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:10%
scientists for hundreds of
years who have tried to do that

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and conferences around this
and journals around it.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
probably nobody has come up

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.525 align:middle line:84%
with a definition
of consciousness

00:29:31.525 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:90%
that everybody agrees with.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> For me consciousness
is awareness.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:10%
And awareness play out
on many different levels.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:10%
So it's sentience, it's a sense
of a knowingness and experience

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:10%
and awareness that is
self and individuated.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably helps to
start with talking about,

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about what some
would call big C or little C

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Little C tends to be the
kind of consciousness

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that neuroscientists talk about.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We're conscious when we
wake up in the morning

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're conscious of
the world and our thoughts

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:90%
We go to sleep or unconscious.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Big C Consciousness,
it would be the type

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of other people
think of in terms of, maybe

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way to say, it
would be the intelligence

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:84%
or the information
that underlies

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the
universe and living systems.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Consciousness is
all about connectivity.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:10%
We are all supremely
intrinsically interconnected

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:10%
on every level.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is separate.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you explore
consciousness,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
when you discover
these incredible depths

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness and to
the conscious experience,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
we have far more resources to be
able to deal with what happens

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
in life and simultaneously
to be able to help

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.025 align:middle line:90%
the people around us.

00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:10%
>> This idea that there's
something that we own

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:10%
personally, that is
a part of the whole,

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:10%
it makes it feel very
likely that we could tap

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:10%
into the whole, that we're
already tapped into the whole.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not like we're
going to reel in this thing

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going
to be more like we're

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
going to cultivate
a relationship

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.660 align:middle line:84%
with an aspect of our self
which is never not there.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems like it should
be natural to be interested

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:10%
in the study of consciousness.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's the one thing
we know we have for sure.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet the thought
of the world somehow

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
being other than purely
objective, purely

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
reductionistic, and
purely materialistic

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:90%
is very scary to people.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.210 align:middle line:10%
PEAR was a research
laboratory that

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:10%
was exploring the interaction
of human consciousness

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:10%
with various kinds of random
physical processes and systems.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:10%
It was primarily an
engineering program

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:10%
because the founder and director
of the lab, my late partner

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:10%
Robert Jahn, was dean of
the engineering school

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:10%
when the program was set up.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:10%
The anomalous phenomena
don't trouble me at all

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:10%
but human nature does.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:10%
When we first set up
the lab, we didn't

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:10%
have a room number or a name
for the lab at that time.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I was being very
clever to identify our door,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I put a Greek letter psi,
stands wave function,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
it stands for psychology,
and of course, it

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:90%
stands for psychic phenomena.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.840 align:middle line:84%
People would say, why do
you have a devil's pitchfork

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
on your door?

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
These were engineers, of course,
who wrote Schrodinger equations

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:90%
every day of their life.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, that's
not a devil's pitchfork,

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
it's a Greek letter.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.725 align:middle line:90%
And they would look terrified.

00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't always this way.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:10%
The taboo is partially an
outgrowth of the Enlightenment

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:10%
when the church
and science split.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason that consciousness
is not fundamental in science

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:10%
and I got interested in
that, why would that happen?

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is
the Council of Trent.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:10%
Between 1545 and 1563,
the Roman Catholic Curia

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:10%
had a series of meetings
in Trento and Bologna.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Science is just beginning
to really become

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.645 align:middle line:90%
a formal force in society.

00:33:24.645 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a number of what's
called natural philosophers.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They weren't called
scientists then,

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:84%
they were called natural
philosophers, who

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:90%
wanted to understand the world.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Not just through religion, but
through experiment and testing.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.695 align:middle line:10%
And so the scientific
method was born.

00:33:40.695 --> 00:33:43.935 align:middle line:10%
>> So the church issued
an edict and they said--

00:33:43.935 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:10%
>> The religious authorities
will look after the souls

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:10%
of everyone, and the natural
philosophers were OK as long

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.035 align:middle line:10%
as they just looked
at the physical world.

00:33:52.035 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys in science, you
have things of materiality.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Things which involve
spirit, read consciousness,

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.095 align:middle line:90%
that's our bailiwick.

00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Very sensible because if
you weren't willing to just

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:10%
research the physical
world as a scientist,

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:10%
you were potentially under
house arrest for the rest

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:10%
of your life as a
heretic, as Galileo was.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Or you were burnt at the
stake like Giordano Bruno was.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:84%
>> The Inquisition actually
began in 1232 but it really

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:84%
takes force with the
Council of Trent.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:84%
In general, for
most scientists, it

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
became a taboo
subject, consciousness.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It was just not worth the
hassle of getting into.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:90%
And so they didn't.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> But it creates a schism.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And that schism just
grew, and so scientists

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:84%
began to denigrate
religion and spirituality.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And spirituality sort
of kept on its track.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:56.274 align:middle line:84%
So the two just separated
literally in their worldviews.

00:34:56.274 --> 00:34:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And for almost 300 years,
that's the way things went.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the last person killed
by the Inquisition in 1826

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
was a Spanish teacher who
taught his students deism, which

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the Inquisition found
to be unacceptable

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and they garroted
this man in public.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's not very long ago.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Science brought us,
well, first of all,

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:84%
the Enlightenment, the
Industrial Revolution,

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It brought us all
the technologies

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that make our lives
so much easier today.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But its basic premise
was that this material

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:84%
realm, this realm, this
universe is all there is.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:84%
There are no other
realms beyond it.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Its appearance of separation
is its true reality.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:84%
That our universe is
essentially an accident

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that evolution
proceeds by accidents.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.820 align:middle line:84%
That after a long, long, long
time, human beings emerged,

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:84%
evolved, and somehow
our consciousness

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
arises from our material
brains, somehow.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:90%
That was the story.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a story of
separation, of accident,

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of meaninglessness,
and it's wrong.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.015 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly wrong.

00:36:13.015 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You can think of the material
world like a superhighway

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.040 align:middle line:84%
network of information
of the universe.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it almost
as the mind of the universe,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And as it gets together and it
becomes more and more complex,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:84%
like all the particles get
together and they make a cell,

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and then the cell divide
and make two cells

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and gets more and more
complex, eventually

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the flow of information
through the whole system

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
has enough bit rate, you can
think, to become self-aware.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The danger there is that
when it becomes self-aware,

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:84%
it might think that it's
separate from the rest

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
because it doesn't

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
know it's part of this
flow of information.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It's thinking, wow,
how did I get here

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and what is this universe?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, and that's
really what's

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:90%
happened to the human kind.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>> You take then the theories
that we understand from

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:10%
a materialistic perspective
and try to say, well,

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:10%
given those theories, how would
you explain how telepathy can

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:10%
exist or precognition?

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And you can do some hand-waving
on that to come up with ideas.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:10%
But it's not very persuasive
to most scientists.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.900 align:middle line:84%
You do surveys of what people
have actually experienced,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority,
up to 90% of people,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:84%
including scientists
and engineers,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
say that they have
had these experiences.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But you also learn very
quickly in the academic world

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that only certain ideas are
acceptable to talk about

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:90%
in public.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons why we
don't talk about it in public

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.980 align:middle line:90%
is because it sounds weird.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
make the connection yet

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
between our internal
experience of which there's

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
very broad range of strange
things that can happen,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and our models about
the way the world works.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So the academic system
around the world pretty much

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
uncritically accepts materialism
as the only viable way

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or the only acceptable way to
understand how things work.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons for that
is because it's so successful.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Most science is working
directly in the mode

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
of let's deconstruct
this thing and then we'll

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
figure out at a very small
level, we use reductionism.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:90%
It works really well.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.003 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
work for everything.

00:38:39.003 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, of
course, is that when

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you go through a
scientific career,

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.570 align:middle line:90%
nobody has taught philosophy.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Like why would you need to
take philosophy of science?

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Why would you need to know
about the sociology of science?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Those are considered very soft
from a scientific perspective

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:84%
so they're generally not
taught so you can end up

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:84%
being a professor who has never
taken a course in philosophy

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and don't realize that
what you're studying

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is set on a whole
bunch of assumptions.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.054 align:middle line:84%
Some of which may be true,
and some may not be so true.

00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:09.886 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always a good student
but in my household there was

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.850 align:middle line:84%
never ever any talk about
going to college or university.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:10%
I decided after that whole
scenario with my father,

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to marry my
high school boyfriend.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:84%
When we're old enough,
we'll get married

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and we'll live happily
ever after because,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, that's what
happens when you get married.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
He had been inducted into
the military at that point.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had it
all figured out.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I went, as
that old saying goes,

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
from the frying
pan into the fire.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:84%
He had not told me he was
going away to war in two weeks

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.480 align:middle line:90%
before he married me.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So I felt betrayed
by him at the get go.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:90%
So he came back different.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:84%
When I hugged him,
I remember I felt

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
like I was hugging a stranger.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
person anymore.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
His medication to get him
through everything, of course,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
was what was available,
drugs, alcohol.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to try to
help him heal himself

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and to stop his drinking
because, I mean,

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
my god, what I was trying to
get away from was alcoholism.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:84%
To make a long story
short, we lost our home.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.100 align:middle line:84%
He was seeing another woman,
spending more time with her

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:90%
than he was with me.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I finally came to the
point where I thought,

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm so sick of this, I
can't take it anymore.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I stuck with him because
of the same reason

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I allowed my father
to touch me at age 9.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.675 align:middle line:90%
It was called fear.

00:40:51.675 --> 00:40:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>> In life, usually, it's easier
to get a relationship going

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.150 align:middle line:10%
or to get a job than to quit it.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:10%
They're hanging on
because of fear of change.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
My expression that I came
up with that helped me

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
with this that I
actually had a person

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
gift me with a sign on the
wall is fear is expensive,

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
love is real, choose wisely.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Some people say fear is a
prayer for what you do not

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:84%
want, because it's
highly energized thought

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking
a negative thing,

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:84%
like I hope I don't
have an accident today.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:33.010 align:middle line:84%
People who are in a fear
loop repeat over and over

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.810 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear had been rampant
throughout my life.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It was my motivator.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, all too
often, I was afraid.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.185 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid that I wasn't worth
a better marriage than that,

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that my self-worth
was still rather low

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and it hadn't gotten
high enough for me

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to trust that I could actually
move on and be all right

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.110 align:middle line:90%
because this wasn't working.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the hardest things
to understand is simply this,

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:10%
that we are programmed.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.530 align:middle line:90%
We've all been programmed.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
brain being computer.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a computer beyond anything
that humans have created.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.980 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to
put in a program

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:90%
so you can operate the computer.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm a young boy, how do
I know what the rules are

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to be a member of a family and
to be a member of a community?

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.047 align:middle line:90%
There are rules.

00:42:22.047 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
You can't go out and
do what you want.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.547 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, where do
you get the rules from?

00:42:25.547 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:90%
A young kid doesn't read a book.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I say, ah, nature
helped him out.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Said, you want to know the
rules, put you in record,

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:84%
watch your parents, watch your
siblings, watch your community.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:84%
What you're observing is not
going into the conscious mind,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
it's not functioning
at that level.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
What you're observing is
going download straight

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:90%
into the subconscious mind.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So where do you get your
behavioral programs from?

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Not from you, you get them by
observing people, teachers,

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
mom, dad, siblings,
and community.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I observed them, download them.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.510 align:middle line:84%
What got downloaded into
your subconscious programming

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.850 align:middle line:90%
was never reviewed by you.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.095 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't filtered by you.

00:43:07.095 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I say, what does that mean?

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I say, I can get good
programs and bad programs.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm just getting programs.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So I have no understanding when
the programs are coming in,

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.270 align:middle line:90%
are these really good or bad?

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just recording.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, about
70% of those programs

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
are disempowering,
self-sabotaging, limiting

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:90%
beliefs that we acquire.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh I'm getting
program and most of them

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
are not going to strengthen
my existence on this planet.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.630 align:middle line:10%
>> All those programs that
we take on by the time of age

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:10%
seven, most of that
programming is intact.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:10%
It's subconscious
but it's there.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:90%
It still runs our lives.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had to become aware
of those types of things

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.265 align:middle line:84%
to begin to shift
and change them.

00:43:50.265 --> 00:43:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:10%
How did I get to be this person?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:10%
What aspects of my life have
taught me how not to be,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.510 align:middle line:10%
and what ones do I
run with because I've

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.755 align:middle line:10%
been taught how to be?

00:44:01.755 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So I came to a
point where I told him,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:11.190 align:middle line:84%
you either get to stay with
me, quitting alcohol 100%,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:15.120 align:middle line:84%
getting some help to
do that, or I am gone.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I will divorce you.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he did
not believe me.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.870 align:middle line:84%
One night, I returned home
from work to our then-apartment

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.000 align:middle line:90%
after losing the house.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "I've
made my choice.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm out with my friends, I'm
drinking, I choose alcohol."

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And I remember saying, "OK.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:90%
You've made your choice.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I will begin the divorce."

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go through
psychological healing or when

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.830 align:middle line:84%
we go through any type of
healing to heal our past,

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:51.200 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be levels
of acceptance of what was.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take
someone through a process

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
of writing down all the
negative aspects of their life.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I would ask
them the question,

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:90%
what have you learned from it?

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:84%
What have you learnt to be and
what have you learnt not to be?

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Every challenge in life
is an opportunity to grow.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember shaking
afterwards, like, wow,

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I actually did this.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually said that I'm
going to divorce him.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to do this.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to be free.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling
so elated like, wow,

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I have lifted 1,000-pound weight
off my shoulders because living

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:90%
with him was like that.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It felt like every
day, what's next?

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen next?

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to have
to contend with now?

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I did follow through
with the divorce, which was

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:90%
finalized on Valentine's Day.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was
February 14, and I

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.860 align:middle line:84%
remember that was one of
the happiest Valentine's Day

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.622 align:middle line:90%
I could remember.

00:45:48.622 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
From that time forward, my life
has been moving up, up, up, up.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That one day when I told
him, fine, this is it,

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
was a huge turning point
for me where I really

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:90%
stepped into my power.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the basic
operating frameworks I use is

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:84%
the framework of story or
narrative or you could even

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:90%
call it mythology.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:10%
Understanding that our
mythology by which I

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.220 align:middle line:10%
mean our deep stories that
define who we are and what's

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:10%
real, our mythology
creates our systems.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But then in turn, our systems
create our mythology by the way

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.615 align:middle line:84%
that they create
us as story makers.

00:46:28.615 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a psychological
construct called future

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:90%
orientation.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
extent to which you

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.570 align:middle line:10%
look toward the future
timeline or your future horizon

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:38.830 align:middle line:10%
in a positive way.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And it correlates with
education, health, well-being

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.420 align:middle line:90%
outcomes.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.300 align:middle line:84%
There have been pretty cool
experiments with folks who

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.890 align:middle line:90%
live in dangerous conditions.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.695 align:middle line:84%
If they get training in future
orientation, they do better.

00:46:51.695 --> 00:46:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They're more likely to graduate
from high school, for instance.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're immersed for
example, in a money economy,

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be
predisposed to believe that

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.760 align:middle line:84%
your well-being is
contrary to my well-being,

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that more for you
is less for me.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So our experience of being
in a highly monetized society

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:84%
generates the story
that maintains

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.665 align:middle line:90%
the highly monetized society.

00:47:15.665 --> 00:47:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> People who are at the
intersection of incarceration,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
poverty, addiction,
abuse, trauma,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:84%
people who you wouldn't think
that the future orientation

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.110 align:middle line:84%
would be positive because,
frankly, why would it be,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:27.910 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.398 align:middle line:10%
But if you could
build technology

00:47:29.398 --> 00:47:31.940 align:middle line:10%
or if I could build technology
that could help draw that out,

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.773 align:middle line:10%
I guess that's what I'm
doing with my hands,

00:47:33.773 --> 00:47:35.870 align:middle line:10%
draw out the future
orientation in a positive way,

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.675 align:middle line:10%
then that could help people
live better, happier lives.

00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not necessarily
about creating a new story.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.920 align:middle line:84%
It's about recognizing
the next story that

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.610 align:middle line:84%
resonates the most with
who we want to become.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a very
important inflection point

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in Einstein's discoveries
that was missed by historians,

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.540 align:middle line:90%
generally.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:10%
Space-time as he describes space
and time being this fabric that

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.980 align:middle line:10%
could bend to
produce gravity, it

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.330 align:middle line:10%
was interpreted as
only analytical tool

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.600 align:middle line:10%
to describe reality,
meaning that it

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.100 align:middle line:10%
was a mathematical model and
it had no physicality to it.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The result was that
there was no need

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.260 align:middle line:84%
anymore to have this
fluid dynamic space that

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:90%
used to be called the ether.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the ether, which
was the medium from which

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:84%
all waves moved and all
the dynamics occurred,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:84%
was replaced with a conceptual
model called space-time.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Einstein went along with
it for over 10 years,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and eventually realized that
relativity required an ether,

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that space be filled with
this energy, with this field.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.250 align:middle line:90%
But by then, it was too late.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Physicists had taken
off with a certain view.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
When he tried to
put it back in, they

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
ignored him, that didn't make
him so popular in the physics

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.580 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So the result is that
ether was removed.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
probably one of the biggest

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
downfall to understanding our
universe and the physics of it

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.870 align:middle line:90%
until modern age.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to find a
theory of everything.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, in physics, everything
is matter, energy, space,

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:10%
and time.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.650 align:middle line:10%
Those are the four things
that encompass everything.

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have quite possibly
information added to that.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.057 align:middle line:84%
Information is an
aspect of reality

00:49:48.057 --> 00:49:49.890 align:middle line:84%
that's as fundamental
as those other things.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's just start
from the beginning.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that space is made
of little particles that

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:90%
are oscillating.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.630 align:middle line:84%
These little particles,
these little fluctuations

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:84%
are occurring at a scale
that's so far-removed from what

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:84%
we experience daily that
we have no idea it's there.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Think of these little
bits of fluctuation

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.730 align:middle line:90%
as bits of information.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They're flowing in
a coherent manner

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:84%
together like trillions
of them, billions of them.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the amount of
sand, grains of sand

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:84%
you could put in a
bubble from the sun

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to Alpha Centauri 40
trillion kilometer bubble.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The sand would be
very, very fine,

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.870 align:middle line:84%
like very small resolution
compared to the bubble.

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the number
of grains of sand.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine all these
are moving coherently

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
because they're stuck
in this like vortex.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.520 align:middle line:90%
They're spinning together.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And that region of
space we call a proton.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:10%
We, I think, wrongly
assumed that the event

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.780 align:middle line:10%
of becoming conscious
was just a random fluke

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:09.910 align:middle line:10%
that all of a sudden we
became aware of our existence,

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:10%
we started being
able to ask questions

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.190 align:middle line:10%
about what is the universe,
how did we get there,

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:18.460 align:middle line:10%
and all this stuff, which
is really not obvious

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.405 align:middle line:10%
that this would occur
just from random function.

00:51:22.405 --> 00:51:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Physics has a way of studying
the fundamentals of space

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and time and reality and energy
and what the physical world is.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Scientists studying
physics are trying

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to get the same answers
to the same questions

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.822 align:middle line:84%
essentially that people
on a spiritual path are,

00:51:37.822 --> 00:51:39.655 align:middle line:84%
but they phrase those
questions differently.

00:51:39.655 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the result of the
mechanics of information

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.250 align:middle line:84%
flowing through the
structure of reality,

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:84%
it is a highly coordinated
effort of reality to produce

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
something that would eventually
become aware of itself.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It is a consequence
of reality itself,

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:04.250 align:middle line:84%
not some epiphenomena
occurring in your brain.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So that changes a lot of
how we think of ourselves

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and how we think of
the universe around us.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't get a theory of
everything until we understand

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.860 align:middle line:84%
how to describe
meaning in the world.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's meaning
that gives everything

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.396 align:middle line:90%
we do any kind of significance.

00:52:22.396 --> 00:52:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's sort of like this
story of the blind men with

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.190 align:middle line:90%
the elephant.

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
One feels the trunk and
says, oh, it's a snake.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The other one feels a leg
and says, no, it's a tree.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And another one feels the
tail and says it's a rope.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:10%
But they're not looking
at the whole thing.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.860 align:middle line:10%
And we do not look
at the whole thing

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:46.000 align:middle line:10%
usually, especially in the
scientific academic world

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.430 align:middle line:10%
where we're all specialists.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like the hose worrying
about how do I get the water?

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.425 align:middle line:84%
>> We are only looking at
one piece of the picture.

00:52:53.425 --> 00:52:57.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Or the toaster being like,
how do I get the electricity?

00:52:57.978 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not your business.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You're either plugged
in or you're not.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you're plugged
in, you can make toast.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you're not
plugged in, you can't.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So not my not my area,
above my pay grade.

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.265 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you plugged into?

00:53:11.265 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What does a
toaster plug into?

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:13.970 align:middle line:90%
If I'm the toaster?

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's like
scientifically

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.878 align:middle line:84%
I have to say there's
a lot unknown here.

00:53:23.878 --> 00:53:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
question of where

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.293 align:middle line:84%
does creative impulse
come from, really,

00:53:28.293 --> 00:53:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that's the question
you're asking.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:31.293 align:middle line:84%
Where does creative
impulse come from?

00:53:31.293 --> 00:53:34.780 align:middle line:10%
>> If you actually look
at creative genius,

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:41.110 align:middle line:10%
what you see is that it is a
process of opening to non-local

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:41.980 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The people we think of
historically as geniuses

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.710 align:middle line:90%
are very explicit about this.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Pablo Picasso, for
instance, people

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.008 align:middle line:84%
wondered how he
could paint so fast.

00:53:52.008 --> 00:53:53.800 align:middle line:84%
He could make these
paintings very quickly.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.780 align:middle line:84%
What he would do is
stare at the canvas

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.720 align:middle line:84%
until he saw the painting
on the blank canvas,

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and then he would paint it.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci says
exactly the same thing.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.390 align:middle line:10%
He says, I stare at the canvas
until I can see the painting

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:08.770 align:middle line:10%
and then I paint it.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says he saw
the theory of relativity

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:90%
one day after being sick.

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.630 align:middle line:84%
As he was recovering,
he went out in a canoe

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and was just sort
of paddling around

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly had
this breakthrough.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.040 align:middle line:10%
Robert Louis Stevenson
said he would

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.660 align:middle line:10%
go to sleep at
night giving what he

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.870 align:middle line:10%
called the gremlins of
his mind a suggestion

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.640 align:middle line:10%
to produce a story.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he
became a famous writer.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Frank Lloyd Wright
is commissioned

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.575 align:middle line:84%
to build a house we
know is falling waters.

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And he puts it off, he puts
it off, he puts it off,

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and he gets a
telephone call, "we'll

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.750 align:middle line:84%
be there in an hour to
see the blueprints."

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And in an hour because he has
had this vision of this house,

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.950 align:middle line:84%
he produces these blueprints
so by the time they get there,

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't know, I
mean, everything's

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.430 align:middle line:90%
just as it should be.

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Brahms says, I'm in an altered
state of consciousness.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, like
Beethoven, I hear the music,

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I see the rhythms, the chords,
the juxtaposition of the notes.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Mozart, same thing.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla says that he saw
the electric motor as a vision

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.570 align:middle line:84%
as he was walking
across Central Park.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Went back to his laboratory and
told his engineers, build this,

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.560 align:middle line:84%
not prototype it
or we'll try this

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe that won't
work and we'll try this.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:90%
He just said build this.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.550 align:middle line:10%
And they did and they plugged
it in and turned it on,

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and it was the electric motor.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.580 align:middle line:10%
So you see this over
and over and over again.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:42.080 align:middle line:10%
First tier people who are
known for their creative genius

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.670 align:middle line:10%
all talk to you
about what amount

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:10%
to non-local
consciousness experiences.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.310 align:middle line:10%
>> So it comes from
somewhere, but I don't think

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:54.420 align:middle line:10%
it's a spatial location.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we can think
about it in space-time.

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It might be from
the quantum vacuum,

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.090 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
about it scientifically.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:10%
>> When I began the
divorce proceedings,

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:11.790 align:middle line:10%
I moved into a guest bedroom
of a dear friend's home

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.460 align:middle line:10%
for a little while so I
could collect some money from

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.130 align:middle line:10%
my work, enough to support
me living in my own space,

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:10%
which I did.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I began just venturing
out into the world,

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.030 align:middle line:84%
just doing things I
had not done before.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
playing volleyball.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:90%
I liked sports.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I liked to run and cycle and
I kind of given all that up.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to hang
on during that marriage.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So I began to be
free, feel free again.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.070 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of
years, I met a man

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:47.400 align:middle line:84%
who became my next
husband, husband number 2.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.330 align:middle line:90%
He was 16 years older than I am.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he's
too old for me.

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.340 align:middle line:84%
My friends said, he's
a nice stable man.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.090 align:middle line:90%
He owns his own business.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.030 align:middle line:90%
He's got-- he has money.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:04.062 align:middle line:84%
He would take-- you would be
comfortable living with him.

00:57:04.062 --> 00:57:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you give him a try?

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:12.510 align:middle line:10%
I did have a download about
getting involved in teaching.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I was invited into a women's
support group in Seattle.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the key elements
that they really focused on

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is how not to be a victim.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, I'd
been to psychiatrists

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of special
help but nothing impacted me

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.660 align:middle line:90%
like going to this program.

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I began to grow and change
in leaps and bounds,

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to
become more involved

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:39.300 align:middle line:90%
with this organization.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.010 align:middle line:84%
After we go through
the programs,

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.920 align:middle line:84%
we have an interview
with one of the staff.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I told this woman I dreamt
that I would be working here

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:90%
with you somehow.

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I would like you
to keep it in mind,

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.030 align:middle line:84%
if you have any openings
I'd love to come join you.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Just about two days later, this
woman called me and she says,

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you know that vision that
kind of dream thing you had?

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.290 align:middle line:84%
She says, why don't you
come downtown to my office

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and let's talk about this?

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And I began working for them.

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So it began to open up
new horizons for me.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.890 align:middle line:84%
For many years,
my second marriage

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:21.370 align:middle line:84%
worked well but our
worlds began to grow apart

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:23.860 align:middle line:84%
after a couple of
decades with him.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We moved to Idaho,
built a home on the lake

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.950 align:middle line:84%
across from where my
grandparents lived.

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:32.410 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't around
very much anymore.

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.990 align:middle line:84%
He would travel to
meet with customers.

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I think he said that he put over
80,000 miles on his vehicles

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.560 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.500 align:middle line:90%
I saw him maybe on weekends.

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Our values had changed.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.060 align:middle line:84%
There were several
years where I was

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:84%
quite unhappy in the
marriage and feeling stuck.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Like here I am in the place I
love to be more than anywhere

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.840 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Life was blissful in that
regard in the situation I was,

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:02.060 align:middle line:90%
but not in the marriage.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there was an inner
stress within me for about,

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, at least five
years, growing, growing,

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:11.140 align:middle line:90%
growing.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.590 align:middle line:90%
What to do?

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:13.940 align:middle line:90%
I want to live where I live.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be with this man.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I had never really been
on a spiritual path.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I had relinquished the
fundamental Christian

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.520 align:middle line:84%
upbringing because I
felt that did not work,

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.810 align:middle line:90%
that was not for me.

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I was searching.

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:37.940 align:middle line:10%
I was really searching at
that point for answers.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I learned about
natural healing when I

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.750 align:middle line:90%
began to explore spirituality.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:84%
In discovering spirituality,
I also explored

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still exploring, well,
probably never stop exploring,

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.960 align:middle line:90%
quantum physics.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm fascinated with it.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.960 align:middle line:84%
To me, it all meshes together,
spirituality, natural healing,

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.460 align:middle line:90%
quantum physics.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.770 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of the same base.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
everything, everything

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is vibration and
energy and information.

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.630 align:middle line:90%
My body, your body, everything.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Having that foundational
understanding that everything

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is energy, vibration,
information, we're

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
talking about the field since
that's what we're made of,

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.841 align:middle line:90%
we can heal with energy.

01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:32.146 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:32.146 --> 01:00:33.529 align:middle line:90%


01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> My story really goes back
to when I was seven years old,

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
which was quite a
long time ago now.

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
I was really sick
with the measles

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.868 align:middle line:10%
and the plan was
that I was going

01:00:45.868 --> 01:00:47.160 align:middle line:10%
into the hospital the next day.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.535 align:middle line:10%
I was going to be admitted
and I was going into something

01:00:49.535 --> 01:00:50.740 align:middle line:10%
called an oxygen tent.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the tent part of
that sounded interesting

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
as a seven-year-old, but I was
too sick to really think much

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.560 align:middle line:90%
about it.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.840 align:middle line:90%
My parents came into the room.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm lying there on the couch
feeling really, really ill.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said to
my father, "honey," she

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
said, "will you kneel
down and say a prayer

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
so that our boy will
be able to get well?"

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And so they did.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, knowing my dad, I'm sure
it was the first time I'd ever

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.315 align:middle line:84%
heard my dad
actually pray, but I

01:01:13.315 --> 01:01:14.982 align:middle line:84%
think they were really
worried about me.

01:01:14.982 --> 01:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I was really sick.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this,
something happened to me.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I had this change that
started at the top of my head.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And it went whoosh through my
body to the soles of my feet,

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:27.770 align:middle line:90%
that fast.

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely totally
healed just in an instant.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, to go from being
really sick one moment

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to being completely
vibrantly totally

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
healthy in the next instant is
just so impossible and so crazy

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.880 align:middle line:90%
that you don't ever forget it.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I remember--

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember anything
else when I was seven.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't but I
remember every detail of that

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.910 align:middle line:90%
like it happened yesterday.

01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:01.102 align:middle line:84%
I held my tongue until
my dad was done praying,

01:02:01.102 --> 01:02:02.060 align:middle line:90%
which didn't take long.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.132 align:middle line:84%
And when he was done, I said,
I'm better, I'm totally better.

01:02:05.132 --> 01:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "well,
honey, that's fine.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Go back to sleep and tomorrow
you're going in the hospital."

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:11.360 align:middle line:90%
And the next day, proved it.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
I was completely well.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So that taught me that
there's a higher power

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that we can draw upon.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And we can ask for help
from that higher power.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We can refer to that power
as God or father or whatever,

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's different depending
on people's belief systems

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But I've come to the
absolute conclusion

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that that higher power
is aware of everything

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
we're doing all the time
and is willing to help us

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.110 align:middle line:90%
if we ask for help.

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
When I was in practice because
I had learned that there

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.200 align:middle line:84%
is this higher power,
I went into practice

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and I got into the habit
working with patients

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of asking for help from that
higher power with every person

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
that I saw.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.388 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
momentary pause, really.

01:03:00.388 --> 01:03:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a totally private,
totally personal habit.

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever knew that I was
doing that but everybody

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that I saw for many, many years,
I would just take a moment

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and just ask for help
from that higher power

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.345 align:middle line:90%
to work on that person.

01:03:15.345 --> 01:03:17.915 align:middle line:90%


01:03:17.915 --> 01:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> One day I was on an
Airplane heading to Glasgow.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.770 align:middle line:10%
I'd never been to
this part of the world

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:32.220 align:middle line:10%
from the Northwestern US,
and I had this thought,

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.460 align:middle line:10%
if this plane went down,
it would be OK with me.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.340 align:middle line:10%
It would be an easy way out.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it-- I remember
I was shocked

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.110 align:middle line:90%
at having a thought like that.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd never had
thoughts like that.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And then it occurred to me when
I stopped and really looked

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
inside myself, you
are so unhappy.

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm so unhappy in my marriage.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like I really couldn't
admit it to myself fully

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.234 align:middle line:90%
until that moment.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I was part of the
teaching team that

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
went to present at the
University of Glasgow.

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought I must have
the worst jet lag

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.380 align:middle line:90%
ever because I was depressed.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.660 align:middle line:90%
I was lethargic.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any energy.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
I felt kind of achy all over.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Our whole group was scheduled to
take a tour of Scotland, which

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I did but I didn't enjoy it very
much because I was just not--

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't feel like myself.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'd sit with
my nose in a book

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and not even look out
the window half the time

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
at the glorious
Scottish countryside.

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't participate
in the teaching team.

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I stayed in my room and rested.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.980 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
By the time I returned
home to Idaho,

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms were
really growing.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
When I showered, it looked
like my whole head of hair

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:02.150 align:middle line:90%
was left there.

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel my hair and
thank god, I got any left.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It was so painful in
my knees I could barely

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
make it up and down the stairs.

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Every day, new
symptoms would come.

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my hands
and they were swollen.

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were stiff and they
were also really painful.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They kind of looked
like baseball gloves.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
They had turned leathery
and stiff and hard.

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
If I just laid flat on
the sofa, I had no pain.

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But that is not a
way to spend a life.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
My local doctors didn't
know what to do with me.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They said, you need to
get to a rheumatologist

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and be diagnosed
because you seems

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
like you have some kind
of autoimmune disease

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I was very humbled.

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I was embarrassed because I
was teaching energy healing.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to be living
health, example of health

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
to be teaching energy healing.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Finally, there came a point
when I could no longer

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.590 align:middle line:90%
dress or undress myself.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
If I fell down, I could
not pick myself up.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
People like my
husband at that time

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
say, you should just
get a wheelchair.

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Just get a wheelchair and
make it easy on yourself.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.210 align:middle line:90%
But I refused to do that.

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
When it came to the point
that my eyesight was beginning

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to fade and I spent a full
week in Seattle for emergency

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.100 align:middle line:90%
testing.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I was taken to a small
consultation room

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
by this female rheumatologist
to be given my diagnosis

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and prognosis.

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
She told me you
have a rare disease,

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:47.810 align:middle line:90%
it's called scleroderma.

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's an excess buildup
of collagen under your skin.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I know it's painful but
you're going to have it

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.970 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
This disease will not go away.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You will be an invalid
the rest of your days.

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.305 align:middle line:90%
You have to get used to this.

01:07:06.305 --> 01:07:08.930 align:middle line:90%


01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:10.115 align:middle line:90%
And then I was sent home.

01:07:10.115 --> 01:07:13.292 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The people are programmed
that their health is beyond

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.920 align:middle line:90%
their control.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Then they seek
someone powerful that

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.790 align:middle line:90%
will facilitate their health.

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:29.410 align:middle line:10%
And so they give up power, I'm
powerless so I have no power,

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:31.765 align:middle line:10%
but I accept what you say.

01:07:31.765 --> 01:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew I had
a choice to make.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I could have made her right,
believed her, but I didn't.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.330 align:middle line:10%
So I made a pact that I'm going
to come out of this disease

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:47.200 align:middle line:10%
even though they say, the
experts say it's not possible,

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.900 align:middle line:10%
no one's ever lived
beyond this disease.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%
You always die a painful death.

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:52.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how it is.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is the accepted
belief about scleroderma,

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:59.120 align:middle line:90%
you do not heal.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.787 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, they
don't know everything.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.272 align:middle line:90%

Maybe you've experienced this
when in times of your life

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:23.100 align:middle line:10%
where you were like totally at
a loss and synchronicity started

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.194 align:middle line:10%
to pop up everywhere.

01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I came across a very, very
powerful paper written by Dr.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Glen Rein, a biophysicist, where
he had been doing experiments

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and found some interesting
things about DNA and how

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
our intention can literally
reprogram the DNA within us.

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The standard explanation is
that the brain can physically

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:54.569 align:middle line:84%
get to all organs because
they're connected physically

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
by nerves.

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking
about communication

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
between the brain and the skin.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:03.930 align:middle line:10%
We need to set up a
communication between the mind

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:09.420 align:middle line:10%
and the energies of the skin and
inform the energy of the skin

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.380 align:middle line:10%
to inform the physical organ,
the skin, to heal itself.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what healing
is all about.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.765 align:middle line:90%
Now normally, you take a drug.

01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, that's
fine if you want

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.680 align:middle line:90%
to work at the chemical level.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Most people go to a
healer and say, oh you

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.229 align:middle line:90%
know how to talk to my skin.

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:28.515 align:middle line:84%
Please talk to my skin
and make it better.

01:09:28.515 --> 01:09:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Annaliese read my research
and she said, oh my god, I

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.729 align:middle line:90%
can do this myself.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I read his paper several
times and made myself a list

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of elements from what I
understood from that paper.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And use the elements
on myself every day,

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
actually several times a day,
for reprogramming the DNA back

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
to a healthy state.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're dealing
with a healer who's outside

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of your body, it's
the same thing.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's their energy,
which has to resonate

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of your skin
and inform your skin how

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%
to get better.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
She was clever enough to say,
well, it's the same concept.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to direct
my energy outside my body.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to direct it
inside to my skin.

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> As I began to work with
the subconscious programming

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and with Glen Rein's process
of using these elements

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
for reprogramming, my
body began to heal.

>> She didn't have to be
specific about her intention.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have to
talk to the DNA,

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
although some people do,
that's one way to do it,

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
whether the DNA is
outside of your body

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.560 align:middle line:90%
or inside of your body.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
She did it a different way,
and this is one of the ways

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that they use in imagery
techniques these days.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.465 align:middle line:90%
Psychologists use this a lot.

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:55.720 align:middle line:90%
You image the end product.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
You imagine yourself
being healthy.

01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
You imagine the final
outcome of what you want,

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's enough.

01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
about the details.

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:12.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Five months after
that dreadful prognosis

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:18.790 align:middle line:10%
and diagnosis, I was completely
back to normal and was deemed

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:19.590 align:middle line:10%
a miracle.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The body is
intelligent enough to say,

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
oh that's what we want, OK.

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do that.

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I have enough
internal intelligence

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.500 align:middle line:90%
that I can control my own DNA.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, you don't have
to tell me to do that.

01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I know to do that.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
If that's the outcome
you want, then that's

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
what we've got to do, and
it does it all by itself.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the body
has its own innate

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
intrinsic self-healing
mechanisms.

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:50.160 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of which
some are known,

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
the energetic ones are
not known but the chemical

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
ones are certainly known, and
that's exactly what she did.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:00.915 align:middle line:84%
She activated her own
internal self-healing.

01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's still a
predominant belief that our DNA

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.170 align:middle line:90%

Like we're born with
certain color eyes,

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
certain color hair, bone
structure, whatever.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't realize
is that most of our DNA

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is reprogrammable.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The food we eat,
the air we breathe,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetism
around us, predominantly

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is our beliefs, our thoughts,
and our emotions reprogram

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.000 align:middle line:90%
our DNA.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's always listening
and responding.

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful our
thoughts, beliefs, and feelings

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
are.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.680 align:middle line:10%
>> So the chemistry of the blood
is controlling the genetics

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.680 align:middle line:10%
and the behavior, but the
chemistry comes from the brain.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.230 align:middle line:10%
I go, yeah, but which chemistry?

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Whatever picture is
held in the mind.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you say I'm in love,

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that's a beautiful picture,
all the romantic movie stuff.

01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
If that's in your
mind, the chemistry

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
that love primarily

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is dopamine, which is pleasure,
that's why we seek it.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is another
chemical release in love

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
because that bonds
me to the source.

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Vasopressin is released
because that chemical

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
makes me more attractive to my
partner so my partner stays.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
growth hormone.

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Growth hormone is
what keeps you healthy

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.945 align:middle line:90%
and maintains your biology.

01:13:25.945 --> 01:13:30.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The energy from my mind is
affecting the energy of the DNA

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:36.100 align:middle line:10%
which then informs the
physical DNA to wind or unwind.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Every single one of
us can reprogram our DNA,

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:41.625 align:middle line:90%
as outlandish as that sounds.

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I can give you an example
from myself that is a parallel

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.140 align:middle line:90%
to what Annaliese went through.

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm the
scientist and I bring

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
in all these healers with
this special gift who

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
are this special energy
that they can heal the DNA.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was all set up
to do an experiment once

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.100 align:middle line:90%
and the healer didn't show up.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, well, what--

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.398 align:middle line:84%
come on, you guys,
I'm all set up.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.342 align:middle line:90%
Do it-- OK, I'll do it myself.

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
All right, what
the hell, you know,

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
waste the whole setup.

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So I meditate, so I just
figured, OK, I'll meditate

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'll try to project my
energy going out of my hands

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.770 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA, affecting the DNA.

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when
I analyzed the results,

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I was able to change
the DNA physically.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
you how empowering

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that is to be able to go,
holy shit, pardon my French,

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.305 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all equally powerful.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You have been programmed not
to have power because if I take

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
away your power, I have
the power and you don't.

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So you start out
everybody equally powerful

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
then you buy teachings and
the teachings disempower you

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%
every day.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher is getting
more powerful every day.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
religion or medicine,

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
we give up power and then say
that those people, the doctor,

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.977 align:middle line:84%
the priest, they're
the powerful ones.

01:15:07.977 --> 01:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what they have to say.

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.768 align:middle line:84%
And then you listen to what
they have to say and almost all

01:15:11.768 --> 01:15:14.050 align:middle line:84%
of it is like, I'm sorry,
your prognosis in this life

01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:16.313 align:middle line:90%
is not so good and you go, oh.

01:15:16.313 --> 01:15:18.045 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:15:18.045 --> 01:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> How is there ever going to
be peace in the Middle East?

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Realistically, how
are we ever going

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to reverse the course of
ecocide on this planet?

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It's totally unrealistic given
what we've accepted as real.

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.920 align:middle line:10%
But at the same
time, you don't feel

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.770 align:middle line:10%
like you're in a fantasy
world that it'll be fine

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:38.132 align:middle line:10%
and you're just ignoring
the cancer diagnosis,

01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:39.840 align:middle line:10%
or you're just ignoring
some big problem.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Like you're truly
in a released state.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Then the synchronicities
line up and you

01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.570 align:middle line:84%
realize that there is
an intelligence at work

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
beyond what we understand.

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:56.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Consciousness is translated
by the brain into complementary

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.850 align:middle line:10%
chemistry, which
goes into the blood.

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:05.235 align:middle line:84%
And that blood nourishes and
instructs 50 trillion cells.

01:16:05.235 --> 01:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness
is consciousness.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's one mass.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.550 align:middle line:10%
What you're doing
is your auric field

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:15.240 align:middle line:10%
is then becoming more
in touch, more expanded

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.580 align:middle line:10%
into that universal
consciousness

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:22.120 align:middle line:10%
whereby by you then
begin to access elements

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.130 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness
that can guide you,

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:26.350 align:middle line:10%
that can help you through life.

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:31.588 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to connect because
we're automatically connected.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a lady with a
small family apple orchard.

01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:37.780 align:middle line:10%
She learned how
to set in her mind

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:41.770 align:middle line:10%
an image that she then strongly
energized with intention

01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.770 align:middle line:10%
and prayer to set this
sort of geodesic weather

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:48.460 align:middle line:10%
bubble over her farm so that
no hail would fall on it.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.330 align:middle line:84%
She'd found a way to very
strongly and specifically align

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
her mind with the support of
vibrational intelligences.

01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
She was articulating them as
archangel Michael and ministry

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.670 align:middle line:90%
of all angels.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
My dad used to talk about
the celestial civil service.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And she tracked
the weather by eye

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and she tracked it on radar.

01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
At any time she saw hail
coming, she'd reinforce this.

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And she shared that there were
occasions where the hail had

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
been so heavy in the region
that nets, hail nets established

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to prevent hail from
falling on crops

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
had been destroyed
and taken down

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
on farms both to the left
and the right of her,

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
but no hail had
fallen on her farm.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me
already hail free

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because she was supplying
their apples to a supermarket,

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and the supermarket defined
apple size literally

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.650 align:middle line:90%
to the millimeter.

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
She was having to harvest this
orchard three times from start

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
to finish in order to pick
the fruit as they reached

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:49.090 align:middle line:84%
supermarket dimensional
specifications.

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have categorized

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.610 align:middle line:90%
as an apple of that kind.

01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So she was tripling her labor
and time costs in the harvest.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So she talks to her
trees about this

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and he asks them
what they're up for.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And she came back with apples.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
She shared that outside
of a very small number

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of random ones that were
obviously out of phase.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But 98% of the apples all came
to supermarket specifications

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:17.140 align:middle line:90%
for her all at once.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
She was very grateful
and very happy.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So within that
context, we understand

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that in some fashion, a real
and actual communication

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
happened between the
person and the plant,

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that it was actually
heard, received, understood

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
in its own way by the plant,
and that the plant had

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
the willingness desire and
capacity to change its growing

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:44.495 align:middle line:84%
pattern to the optimum benefit
of its steward caretaker

01:18:44.495 --> 01:18:45.295 align:middle line:90%
person.

01:18:45.295 --> 01:18:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a subject that
scientists can't study

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
because you can't measure
the energies of a spirit.

01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
You could barely see
them or feel them.

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I took a slightly
different approach.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.595 align:middle line:84%
My hypothesis is
that these all have

01:19:03.595 --> 01:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
a different kind of energy.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we could
distinguish one kind of spirit

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
from another by virtue of
the energy that they contain.

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.040 align:middle line:10%
So it turns out
that some people can

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:21.080 align:middle line:10%
bring these entities into their
physical body and talk to them,

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.950 align:middle line:10%
deal with them, tell
them what to do.

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I met such a
healer once who was

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
able to call on the
energy of Saint Michael.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We have this entity
come into her body

01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and she directs it
toward this test tube.

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Now the test tube contain DNA.

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
DNA has lots of properties and
lots of things you can measure.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I measured the frequency
signature of the DNA.

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
There are various
ways of measuring

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:51.580 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies of DNA.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
that Saint Michael

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
had a very
characteristic signature.

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
When I went to China,
I had my qigong master

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
treat the DNA sample
and that person turned

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
on three different
frequencies, one of which

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
was the same that was
turned on by Saint Michael.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we can
now say that there

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is some overlap between
the energy coming off

01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
of the body, in this
case a qigong master,

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of Saint Michael
because they both turned

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
on this one
particular frequency.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It was a 94 kilohertz of DNA.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if
different entities have

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:33.400 align:middle line:90%
different signatures.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
If Saint Michael comes back
in on the second occasion,

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:38.150 align:middle line:90%
will he have the same effect?

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe he spoke to
God just a few hours ago

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's got all this God energy
and his energy is different.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.140 align:middle line:84%
That would affect
the DNA differently.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he met with
my Aunt Matilda

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
the other day, brought
his energy down.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they do interact
with humans, these spirits.

01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Does that change their energy?

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.087 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
questions you could

those things to happen,

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:10.700 align:middle line:10%
which are beyond what we

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.390 align:middle line:10%
i.e., beyond what we
understand as practical,

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:17.960 align:middle line:10%

a code word for beyond the realm
