00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of a traditional
masculine guy.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I really relate to the
idea of masculinity

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:90%
as a provider and protector.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:10%
That's how it lives
inside me, and I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:10%
don't feel like
that is something

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:10%
that was conditioned in me.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:10%
I feel that that's
inherent in my nature.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, I have an inherent nature
to want to provide and protect.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I definitely feel that men
have been locked in a gender

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:90%
role, the same as women were.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:10%
of the divine masculine and
that we both embody that,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:10%

is and what kind of clothes

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, culturally,
for at least 2,000 years,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
there's been an emphasis on
the masculine versus feminine.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a--

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
let's call it negative,

quite a few problems.

about feelings, which
don't make any sense.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think it takes power

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to unravel some
of those messages.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
It takes more strength to
deal with your feelings

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
than it does to not
deal with your feelings,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and that's a value that I have.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
As a man I've been taught
that strength is important

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and courage is important.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And for me, strength
and courage have

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to do with dealing
with the things I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%

talking about the ways that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.618 align:middle line:84%
they've been hurt,
or they're afraid.

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%

I don't want to deal with takes

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.035 align:middle line:90%

That's what I'm going
to do with my energy.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we can
reframe and we have

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
to reframe how much strength it
takes to do that kind of work.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
masculine thing.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Because so much healing is
needed in that, in our culture,

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
what I found many years
ago when I started this is,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
as I looked at my own heart,
the female in me was ticked off

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I had to back up and
say, OK, let's have tea.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's dance together.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's have conversation
and what have

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
you to heal enough
of that wound so

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that the strength
of my inner feminine

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
could be there with
the inner masculine,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:90%
dancing together well.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I had been meeting
quite a few negative women.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
After doing that
interior work, I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
am met-- the most blessed
angel woman came into my life

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
with very high
positive feminine.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So it starts like
many religions.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Talk about within yourself.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
If you want peace in the
world, within yourself.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The healing of
masculine-feminine

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.952 align:middle line:90%
starts there as well.

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think men exactly
know what they want to be yet.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.993 align:middle line:84%
I think men are still
figuring it out.

00:04:22.993 --> 00:04:24.828 align:middle line:84%
I think men are very
confused right now

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%
about their place in the world.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I think it was obvious.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Our fathers-- it was
like, provide and protect.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, go get a job.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Provide for your family.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Work.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
That's your life.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.678 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the case anymore.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of
guys are confused

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.197 align:middle line:84%
about how they're supposed
to be in the world

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and how they're supposed to
be in relationship to women.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
coming to terms with it.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I find myself talking.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:10%
And talking can
be the distancing

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:10%
from the true quiver
of vulnerability

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:10%
and to just honor and understand
how deep our avoidance is

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:10%
of true contact.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:10%
We avoid it so much,
true, deep contact.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
When we get in conflicts with
our partners, we look away.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> There's obvious cruelty.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:10%
You can say something to
somebody that is hurtful.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:10%
That's an obvious way.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:10%
But another way to be
cruel is to withdraw.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So if I feel hurt by you,
one of the things I may do

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:90%
is just withdraw from you.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
intention is,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.417 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pull back my love.

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pull
back the connection.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to tell you why.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that place, you're
going to be confused.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You're going to suffer, and
I'm never going to tell you.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And now I have the power,
and I'm punishing you

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
for what I've done.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that's
hiding, of course,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
is the vulnerability, which is,
what you did or what you said--

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:90%
it really hurt me.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hard
thing for a lot

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of people to admit,
especially when they're

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of conflict.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Or we blast.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And the blasting-- there's
no contact in the blasting.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:90%
There's just [CLAPS] blast.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES] I think
that we actually

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:10%
have not that much
tolerance for real contact.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
People that have a bit
more tolerance for contact

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
are going to be the
ones that are going

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
to be having more intuition.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Men are taught that
we shouldn't express

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.375 align:middle line:10%
your feelings, but we're all
having feelings all the time.

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the reason I
like sports is because I

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:10%
like the way it makes me feel.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a robot.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So when
I like something,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
it's because I'm feeling
good when I do it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
We're all having feelings.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all dealing with
feelings all the time.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We just have to make
them more transparent.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to get comfortable
with dealing with what's really

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:90%
happening, and it frees us.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think, it
doesn't mean we have

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
to express ourselves
emotionally all the time,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean we have to say our
feelings to everybody or cry,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to be authentic
with ourselves

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and learn to be able to be clear
about what the feeling we're

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
having is so that we don't
project it on other people.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What I see is a lot of
confusion and I think probably

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a lot of resentment
in part because I think--

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're quite seeing
men clearly, in my opinion.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're quite
understanding the issues.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we're pathologizing
it a little bit.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the toxic masculinity.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
something wrong.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the place where
it's like, you pathologize,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you're not actually
seeing what's

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:84%
happening emotionally
in that men are scared.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:90%
They're confused.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't know who
they're supposed to be.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And when men are
scared and confused

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and don't know who
they're supposed to be,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:90%
they're going to act out.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You loved your
mom, hopefully.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:90%
You loved your dad, hopefully.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:10%
Think of them as their best,
how patient they were changing

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:10%
your diapers over
and over and how much

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:10%
they wanted to teach
you and see you thrive.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:10%
And imagine them
being here embodied,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:10%
that you have a
nurturing masculine

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:10%
and nurturing feminine.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
exceptions to that.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Men-- when I was growing
up, a lot of fathers

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:90%
just were pretty absent.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They'd work, come
home, be tired.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But still even there,
they would seem

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to spring to the occasion
and show gentleness.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.238 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's way
of saying I love

00:08:44.238 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
you, instead of loving
you and hugging you,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
would be hit you on the knee
gently with the newspaper

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and say, how are you doing, kid?

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And to be able, as an
adult, to translate that to,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I would give you
my life for you--

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
because he would have.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So if we can look
inside, I think

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
we can find good examples of
that high masculine and high

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:90%
feminine.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're beautiful energies
for us humans to work with.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we can have a
dialogue around emotions

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.975 align:middle line:84%
in our culture that doesn't put
feelings in a category separate

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:90%
from everything else.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Feelings are underlying
everything we do.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:90%
The more literate.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We can become with what that is,
whether men or women, the more

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
we can unravel the problems
that we create for ourselves.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the medicine is
we need a little bit more

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:90%
of a sense of humor.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:10%
We need to be a little
bit less arrogant.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be a
little bit less arrogant,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
we need to admit
how arrogant we are.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Simply saying that
we're not animals

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
is really arrogant, I
find, because it's like--

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we say that, the only
thing that we have in common

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
is not us.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
We're in big effing trouble.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's
tremendously arrogant.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Men, I think, need a mission.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:10%
They need to know
what the goal is.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:10%
And they need to work toward it.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And they like to work
together in teams to do that.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
When I'm on my mission,
it's like, life

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:84%
gets a lot easier
because it's, like, it's

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
right in front of me.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm not, I start to get
anxious and develop bad habits,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and my addictions come up.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think men are
figuring it out,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
but I think they do need to
figure it out for themselves

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
on their own terms.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm interested a lot
in vulnerability and courage

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
and generosity.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Those are three
ethical imperatives

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with intuition
to me clinically and just

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
in life, like these
three guiding lights.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition is a function
of release into not knowing.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:10%
Maybe men, especially
in this culture,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:10%
are less comfortable
with not knowing.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
have the answer.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's uncomfortable to
admit that you don't know,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
because I'm supposed
to be in charge here.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, me man.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.685 align:middle line:90%
Me in charge.

00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:27.144 align:middle line:90%
And to let go of knowing--

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:90%
um.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And we don't know.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We can say till we're
blue in the face,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.685 align:middle line:84%
or there are different
stories about that we know.

00:11:36.685 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:90%
But do we know now?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And then there's Holy wars that
are fought about this and we're

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
tearing ourselves apart
about that we know,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and different
schemas of knowing.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very sad.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at us.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:10%
>> We used to have these fourth
graders from a nearby school

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:10%
district that would
come to visit each year.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:10%
They were doing their
first science project.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The teacher had
contacted me, and they

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
said they'd like to
go to a laboratory

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
so the kids could
see a science lab.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But whenever they called
up any of the labs

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the area at
Princeton or Rutgers

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
or any of the
other schools, they

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
were told that they
were too busy to waste

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:90%
their time with little kids.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, I cannot
think of anything that's more

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
important in my life than
spending time with little kids.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Bring them on.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And over the course
of the next 10 years,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
we must have had about a
thousand 10-year-olds coming

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:90%
through the lab.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I used to show them
around, let them

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
try some of the experiments.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But I'd also say,
how many of you

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
want to be scientists
when you grow up?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And there'd always
be a bunch of hands.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, you know, if you
want to be a good scientist,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
there are two things you
have to learn how to say.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And they're not easy.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:90%
One of them is, I don't know.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The other one, which is even
harder, is, I was wrong.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest thing that gets
in the way of intuition is

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
power thought, which relies on
the framework of what you know

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
or what you think you know and
gains knowledge from reasoning

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%
forth from that framework.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Reliance on what you know shuts
out anything that you cannot

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:90%
know through ordinary cognition.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a dominating way
of engaging the world.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:90%
It's like, here's what is.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And here's another
piece of what is,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and this is different from that.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And here's what is.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're imposing
order onto reality.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
That expression of power is,
especially in patriarchy, very

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
much a male function.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I think in our culture,
men are more conditioned to

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
or required to engage in
that kind of power thought.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.033 align:middle line:84%
But the more tightly
you hold on to that,

00:14:06.033 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the less room there is for
anything else to come in.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really
hard to say, stop.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.253 align:middle line:10%
Something doesn't
feel right here,

00:14:12.253 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:10%
but I don't know what it is.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:10%
And it needs time and space.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:10%
You rarely hear anyone say that.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody were to have
the courage to say that,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
the response is almost
invariably, well, OK, sure.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:90%
But maybe figure that out later.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:84%
What if we went
the opposite way?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
What if the goal of any group
or organization or family

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
was just to listen
to what really,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
truly, and deeply
wanted to emerge?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what a feminine-led
world would look like.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It would look like a recentering
in the mystery of the moments,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
feeling into that
truth, and then using

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
all of the great masculine
tools of clarity and power

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to allow that subtle truth
to emerge instead of killing

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:90%
it to achieve some goal.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there is a next
expression of power thought.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:10%
It says, OK, let's accept
that this is what is.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:10%
And here's the goal.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:10%
And how are we going
to make that happen?

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:10%
There is a role.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a place for
making things happen.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
For linear-directed,
goal-oriented thinking,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
we have these gifts.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:90%
We have our hands.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:90%
We can exert force.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just containing
it in its proper realm,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and that realm
needs to be informed

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
by a feminine function
that can listen to life

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:90%
outside of our categories.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And this can all be happening
inside one person as well.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>> This is one of the things
about the left hemisphere

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:10%
and about imperialization
and colonialization,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:10%
the colonialization of ideas,
how the significance junkie

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:10%
wants to make narratives and
schemas and stories and then

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:10%
create a status hierarchy that
says, OK, you need to do this,

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:10%
this, and this.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this,
this, and this,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the person that's higher
up on the status hierarchy

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
will say, good job, son.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You get to come to rung number
three, in which you need

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.658 align:middle line:90%
to do this, this, and this.

00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And once you do
this, this, and this,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
then I'll give you
more responsibilities

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
and more power.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you more money.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you do
this, this, and this,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
then you can come up to this
ladder but not as high up

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:90%
as me, ever.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
That is the sort of hidden
operating system of everything,

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
basically, the status
hierarchy thing.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
structures of power.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a part of me
as a man that's feminine.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
This work that I'm
doing is feminine.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And in every man, there
is a feminine aspect.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:10%
As a human, you want
you have a deep desire

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:10%
to integrate all the
parts of yourself.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And men, for the most part,
are taught to push aside

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:90%
their feminine nature.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
But by pushing aside
your feminine nature,

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
you're pushing aside
a part of yourself.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And on a deep level, you
don't want to do that.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So can you, if you notice
something feminine in yourself,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
embrace it?

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Not because the
feminine is good,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to do something
that's good, but because,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
by doing it, you'll feel
that much more whole.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I always had these
intuitive gifts deep down,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't owning
them, because I

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
was afraid of this
quality of myself.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But as I started to own it,
own this feminine, subtle,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
feeling-based side of
me, I felt more myself.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It was just embracing me.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's the quest for men,
to embrace their feminine side.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Anybody who is strongly
oriented toward power thought,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a man or a woman,
is going to have less access

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:90%
to intuition.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it could even be that
women who take that on

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.948 align:middle line:84%
and seek to become as men have
been have even less access

00:18:16.948 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to their intuition than men do.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Many women have been raised
in a way that the only way

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:10%
to find power in the
1950s, et cetera,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:10%
was to mimic some of
the masculine area.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the high
divine masculine being shown.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's a great need
for my point of view

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to bring in good examples of
high masculine, high feminine,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and that integration in people.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you take, say, a
female politician now

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
in the last election,
if she's assertive,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
they will say she is harsh.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And there'd be
almost no way to win.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And if you came
in as a fully-expressed male,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the society has a little
difficulty with that as well.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:10%
>> There might be knowledge that
can only be expressed in other

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.807 align:middle line:10%
concepts or in another language.

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:10%
It's just like--
it's like a language.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:20.898 align:middle line:84%
If you're monolingual and
only can think in the concepts

00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and categories of
a certain language,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.288 align:middle line:84%
there are thoughts
that you cannot have.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that you cannot see.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
There are distinctions
you cannot make.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Different emotional energies
get tolerated by different

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
people in different ways.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So like, we have a window
of tolerance for shame.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a window of
tolerance for anger.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a window of
tolerance for care.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
We have a window of
tolerance for joy,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
a window of tolerance for fear.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, hey, maybe a person's
window of tolerance

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:84%
for emotions and just
general vulnerability

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of being in this interbeing
place with another human being,

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that that has something
to do with intuition.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's say, tons and tons
of men are selling their souls

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
in jobs in order to
support the family.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
That is the archetypical
prostitute energy, if you will.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And it would show and express
in masculine and feminine

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
perhaps different,
depending on what

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:90%
you could get paid for now.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
If we said that men tend to
be creators, yes, that's true.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to also
be creators, but they

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
may do it in a little
bit different manner.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:84%
If you said women are
more passive or receptive,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and that will get you in
trouble with some people.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place
where the masculine

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
can get grace and strength
from passivity, receptivity.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And they really
dance well together.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:84%
That's how the energies are
supposed to work together.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's not who's better, not--

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much
anything you would say,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:84%
this is ultra
feminine, I could point

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
to a masculine
counterpart, or vice versa.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Men have a much longer
journey around intuition than

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:10%
women do because
women, on the whole,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:10%
feel this stuff in their
bones, and they're just looking

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:10%
to step into language that
articulates what they already

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:10%
know.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Whereas men have
grounded so deeply

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:84%
in a dead world on the
whole that their identity

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
is wrapped up in it.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Most men in power
default to the idea

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that they've figured things out.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I've
figured things out,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I've reached
this level of power.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.132 align:middle line:84%
And their identity then
becomes fixed in this idea

00:21:50.132 --> 00:21:51.340 align:middle line:90%
of having figured things out.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.632 align:middle line:84%
And how many men even in
their day-to-day lives-- like,

00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
my job is to figure things out.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.145 align:middle line:84%
So surrendering that identity
is a really hard journey.

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:90%
But like, OK, what can men do?

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Men can play more.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what men can do.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Men can play more.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I want men to play more.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I want me to play more as a man.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I like playing.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:90%
I feel like--

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.305 align:middle line:90%
Ask me that question again.

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%

and playful.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that is
part of what we need.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you're men who don't
tend to play sports a lot,

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:90%
they lose that.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:84%
When they go back to
it, there's an openness

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.385 align:middle line:84%
and a spaciousness
in their lives

00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:90%
that I think can come into it.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
that would be good.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it'd
be better for men

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to be playing sports than
watching sports all day

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%

and arguing over stuff.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
That's further cementing the
idea that the thing to do

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.010 align:middle line:90%
is to figure it out.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas actually, the thing
to do is to get on the field

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:90%
and play.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:10%
So we use different
physical techniques,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:10%
like hitting and
punching and kicking

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:10%
and breathwork
essentially to help

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:10%
people feel feelings that
get trapped or lodged

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:10%
in the body from their childhood
and so that they can feel

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:10%
it and liberate those feelings.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's very powerful.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:90%
It's very cathartic.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very intense.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely
not for everyone.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's most
exciting because you

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
can do it one-on-one
but to do it in groups.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what
happens is the group

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
has its own energy
field that gets created.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then things just
start to bounce around.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you can learn
how to follow it,

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
magical things can happen
that you could never

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
create on your own or you could
never do in one-on-one therapy.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
that we try to work with

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.550 align:middle line:84%
is people's judgments
because judgments can really

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
reveal a lot about what
we're holding back,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and we all have judgments.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things we do
is to create a space for people

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to bring out their
judgments, which

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
is a real risk, especially
when it's about other people.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
It can create a lot of
conflict in the room,

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
which can get uncomfortable.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you learn
how to work with it,

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
it can take you
interesting places.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Judgments are a mask.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And underneath the
judgments is usually

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
the negative intention,
which is the shadow.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately where
you're trying to take people,

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is into their shadow, into
their negative intention,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
into the place that
maybe they want

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to punish people for
their perceived wrongs

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that they've done to them.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that energy that's
inside us that generally

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
we hide from the world because
we feel shameful about it,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
or somehow it feels
wrong, and certainly we

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
hide it from ourself, to me--

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and I've learned this
through my own work

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and through working
with others--

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
is going all the way
in to our negativity,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
our rage, our hate, our cruelty,
is the path to enlightenment.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It takes you through
to wholeness.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you to your
core, which-- and at our core

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is a place of unity
and wholeness.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is the thing
that challenges people most

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
about the work, is, is it good
for me to express my hate?

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not supposed
to express my hate.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to be positive.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
When you can create
a space for people

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to bring that out and
bring consciousness to it,

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
it allows them to be more
conscious in their life

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and more aware of the
patterns that they are engaged

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
in in their life or
in their relationships

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and so that they can
ultimately take responsibility.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
what the work is about,

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
taking full self responsibility
for everything we feel

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and that we all have
hate and judgment

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and cruelty that
lives inside us.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a hard thing
to take ownership of,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's, for me, the
most important thing

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:90%
to take ownership of.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I said,
I think I really do

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
feel it's the path
to liberation.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no way to uphold
your reputation and integrate

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:84%
whole other parts of yourself
that seem to cut against

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:90%
your reputation.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- do you want to
continue to grow through this

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
artificial self that
makes you feel safe,

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but something underneath
always feels a little bit off?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Or might there come a day
when you have the courage

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to let go of that artificial
self or an aspect of it

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and integrate that other
part that's always been there

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
but that you didn't
want to look at?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I feel better having
done that work.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel better being able to
sit in front of you and say,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I am open and loving
to all parts of myself.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I am grounded in who I am.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:90%
I know myself.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a part of my
self that I haven't seen yet,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to see it and I
want to integrate it.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's a place of real power
and presence and wholeness,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and I recommend it to you.
