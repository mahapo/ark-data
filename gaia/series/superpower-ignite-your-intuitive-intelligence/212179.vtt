00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that most
parents have good intentions,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and so I don't want anybody
to feel bad about themselves

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:84%
for thinking they're doing the
right thing with their child.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.355 align:middle line:84%
It begins with
the parents really

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:18.730 align:middle line:84%
looking at their
own relationship

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.855 align:middle line:90%
with food and their bodies.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of my clients who come
in with eating disorders

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
can name family members,
parents, grandparents,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
who have had their
own eating disorders

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.748 align:middle line:84%
and give them that
message early on.

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe you shouldn't
have that second helping.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does
that child believe?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.255 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong with
my eating more?

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
wrong with me?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with fixing
one's own relationship

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.528 align:middle line:90%
with food and body.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So intuitive eating is a
dynamic interplay of instinct,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:90%
emotion, and thought.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:10%
It starts with the
dinosaur era where

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:10%
the brain functioning at
that time was very primitive.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:10%
It was the reptilian brain,
and it was pure instinct.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
That dinosaur had the
instinct to survive

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and would find food, whether it
was a little dinosaur or plants

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that
dinosaur was eating, just

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
for the purpose of surviving.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:90%
No feelings, no thoughts.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
As mammals evolved,
there was another layer

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of brain functioning
that came about,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's called the mammalian
brain or the limbic brain.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reptilian brain
is right at the brain stem,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and the limbic brain, which
is the seat of emotions

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and social behaviors,
sits right on top

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:90%
of that instinctual matrix.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:10%
Pets, they definitely
have feelings.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:10%
People know that their pets get
upset if they go out of town.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Animals have feelings
and instincts.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But what differentiates
us as humans

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the neocortex
or the cognitive part

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
This is the thinking part.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
instinct to survive.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We have the instinct of hunger,
fullness, what tastes good.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Our emotions can come
in and alter that,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
affect our instincts.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we use the
rational part of the mind

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to monitor the emotions, nurture
ourselves, comfort ourselves,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
make decisions for
ourselves that are going

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
to be for our best interest.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's what intuitive
eating is from that standpoint.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It's also anti-diet,
weight-inclusive guidelines

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
for how to tune in
to one's inner wisdom

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
that inner wisdom,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
we're born with it,
for the most part.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are
some babies maybe

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
who have some
developmental problems.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, babies are

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
born knowing when they're
hungry, and they cry.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And when they're full, they'll
turn their little heads,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get
more food into them.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they start becoming
acquainted with solid foods,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
they know what they like, they
know what they don't like.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that child is brought
up in an intuitive eating

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere, that child stays in
touch with all of those signals

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and tends to grow up without
any issues with eating.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there are many
influences in our society

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
that pull parents away.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I will say they
have good intentions

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
but are often interfering with
that child's intuitive wisdom.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the myths
of intuitive eating

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:90%
is that it's a weight-loss plan.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.342 align:middle line:84%
If I just eat intuitively,
oh, I'm going to be so good,

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to only
eat when I'm hungry

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and stop when I'm full.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and then I'm
going to lose weight.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Intuitive eating is
not a weight-loss plan.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
disconnected to it.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Do people's weight
change sometimes?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, sometimes, if
they're starting to really

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:90%
tune in to themselves.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the goal.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And if people start
thinking about that,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.268 align:middle line:84%
it really disconnects them
from their internal signals

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
because if they've got in
the back of their mind,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.623 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I can eat
anything, but, well,

00:04:14.623 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
if I eat that, I won't
be able to lose weight,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
they're back in diet
culture and diet mentality.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that is a big myth
that has to be dispelled

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because intuitive
eating is really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from weight loss.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I was
thinking the other day

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that in the phrase
"diet culture,"

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:90%
there's the word "cult."

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:90%
It had not occurred to me.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yeah, diet
culture is a real cult.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.998 align:middle line:84%
It's this cult of
certain foods are good,

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
certain foods are bad,
certain foods are healthy,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:90%
certain foods are not healthy.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Just the way there's diet
in dietitian, you know?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a problem.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So I've really actually
often or mostly called myself

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
a nutrition therapist
rather than a dietitian

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:90%
even though I am.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Another method is it's just
about hunger and fullness.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what people think.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand that
there are 10 principles,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and hunger and fullness are
only two of the 10 principles.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that feeds into the myth
that you can't use intuitive

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
eating in certain
eating disorders.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I get that all the time.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it really actually angers
me because, for example,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
if a person has anorexia
nervosa and is not really

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
getting reliable hunger
signals, it's full all the time

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
because everything's slowed down
in the body, people will say,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't tell that
person to eat when she's hungry

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:90%
or he's hungry.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:90%
They're never going to eat.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, intuitive
eating isn't just

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:90%
about hunger and fullness.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So I can work with
someone from the get-go

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to look at all the
other parts of it,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to start to make
peace with food,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to start respecting
their bodies,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and eating is a way of
respecting your body.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And looking at emotions, are
you restricting your food

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
as a way to feel some sense
of control in the world?

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
So there's satisfaction.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a big piece of it.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
You can use satisfaction
as a goal in eating.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Probably another myth is
that intuitive eating is just

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.082 align:middle line:84%
about eat whatever
you want whenever

00:06:10.082 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%
you want as much as you want.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's limited.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not simply that.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's tuning into
how is it feeling?

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.303 align:middle line:90%
How does the food taste?

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
When my friend says to me, if
you tell me I can eat steak,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll never stop eating steak.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can help them
understand the concept

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.512 align:middle line:84%
of habituation, and they
see that actually, you'll

00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
get a little sick of
steak if you have it

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:90%
every night for a month.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
There are two main psychological
reasons why diets don't work.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The biggest reason to me,
the most important reason

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.785 align:middle line:84%
is that somebody else is
telling you what to do.

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It's externalized.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It has no connection with
your inner wisdom at all.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Even if you create
your own diet,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
it's based on what
you hear out there

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
in the universe about
what you shouldn't eat,

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:90%
what you should eat.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, that
autonomous part of us

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that's part of our developmental
life from early on,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
from toddlerhood, when the baby
first starts to learn around 18

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
months that it's no longer
attached to its mother

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and is a person of its own
and goes around the house

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and wants to pick its own toys
and eat what it likes and not

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
eat what it doesn't like,
and the favorite word is no.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is this
developmental stage

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that is the beginning
of the development

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:90%
of the ego, the healthy ego.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And it re-emerges
big-time in teenagehood.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers, adolescents are
all about achieving autonomy,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
individuating,
separating from home,

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and doing some things sometimes
that their parents don't

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
want them to do.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, that part of us--

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much interested
in inner child work,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and that part of us
is, in my opinion,

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:90%
with us our entire lives.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I know all about
my little teenager,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:90%
my little toddler in me.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I know when she's activated.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, a
diet is ultimately

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
going to fail
because ultimately,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
a person with a healthy
ego is going to balk at it

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, I'm
not going to do it.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that person
feels bad about themself.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I have
clients that come in

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I'm such a
failure at dieting, I'll say,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
no, you're not a
failure at dieting.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
You're a success
in ego development.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them that
someone who has not

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
developed a very strong ego
is the kind of person who's

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.087 align:middle line:84%
going to be pulled into a cult.
And I will say to that person,

00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but you don't appear to me
to be the kind of person that

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.859 align:middle line:84%
would be pulled into a cult.
And normally, they go, no.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:90%
That would never happen.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that strong ego
is asserting autonomy

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
by not staying on the diet.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's, to me, the
fundamental reason

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
why diets don't work.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
The other important part
of it is deprivation.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much on
any diet, a person

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to be told how much to
eat, when to eat, what to eat.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And typically, they're not going
to get what they really want.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.148 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, they
can hold on to that

00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
because they have
all these fantasies

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
of what will happen if they--
well, the diet is always geared

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to weight loss and the
fantasies of what will

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:90%
happen if they lose weight.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And along the way,
that deprivation

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
just increases and
increases to the point

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:90%
that they can't take it anymore.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And they'll start to
eat something that they

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:90%
haven't had for a while.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And boom, they feel
out of control.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Then they start to feel
guilty because they

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
think they shouldn't do it,
and they've broken their diet.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back and forth
until they find the next diet.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like a seesaw, up and
down, guilt and deprivation.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We really want to be
at peace, and that's

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
what's going to give us
the opportunity to have

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:90%
the total sense of health.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The more you worry
about what you eat,

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
the higher your stress
levels, the higher

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
your cortisol levels.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what's
more dangerous for your body

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:90%
than any particular sweet roll.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And some things we have no
control over, they're genetic.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what we eat
or don't eat or what we do.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be,
like my cholesterol levels.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.144 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no rules in
intuitive eating.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people like to
take intuitive eating

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into the intuitive
eating diet or the hunger

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
fullness diet.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
something to control them.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
There are more
guidelines to help

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:84%
you get the most satisfaction
and pleasure out of eating.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:90%
It's being gentle with yourself.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's being compassionate
toward the fact

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that you may have only had
food to cope because you

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't know any other way.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Kids who maybe grow up in homes
where there's a lot of abuse,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
food is a comfort.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And we all need to be able
to make peace with the fact

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that food can be comforting
and to not judge ourselves

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
if we want to get
comfort from food.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
can stay present,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.223 align:middle line:84%
the more you can
feel that comfort

00:10:55.223 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and the more you can get
the pleasure from the food.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who are able to get
the foods that we want and eat

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
as much of it are
very privileged.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Intuitive eating is a privilege.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is able to be an
intuitive eater when they don't

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
know where they're going to
get the next amount of food

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:90%
that they need.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:10%
In an environment
of poverty, that's

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:10%
going to affect a person's
health and well-being

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:10%
because they just
don't have access.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.943 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
access to health care.

00:11:24.943 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
access to the food

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
that they need just
to nourish themselves.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
judgment out there.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
People judge,
let's say, a mother

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
who only has enough money to
buy fast food for her children.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's not
judge that person.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
That may be the only thing
that she has access to.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And at least she's getting
some food in their bodies.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to work on all
those judgments that people

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
carry around, all those
years and years of judgment.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It really takes you
away from the tuning in.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's about staying present,
really listening, listening

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
to those hunger
signals, noticing

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
when you're starting to get
full and really noticing

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
whether the food
is tasting as good

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
as it did in the beginning.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I often ask a
client who comes in,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
would you eat a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich on your way

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:90%
to your favorite restaurant?

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably,
the person is going

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to say, well, no, of course not.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say, why?

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, it won't taste as good.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that
intuitive knowledge

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that food just tastes better
when you have some hunger.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, if
you're starving,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't been
eating all day long,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're presented
with food, you

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
can't really
appreciate it or stay

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
present because the
survival part of the brain,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
the instinctual part of
the brain, reptilian part,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
sends out chemicals to get
you to get as much food,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
as many calories, as
many carbohydrates

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
as you can to keep
the brain functioning.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And in that process,
you can't really

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
notice how good,
the food tastes.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
When I ask people to pay
attention to satisfaction,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
it really informs looking
at hunger and fullness

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and how that is connected
with satisfaction.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
start to tune in.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really listening.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I say again,
staying present.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
We are so distracted
by so many things.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
People will get on their
computers with their meal.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And before they know
it, the food's gone.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even notice
that they ate it.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at what's the
environment for which you

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
can get the most
satisfaction out of eating.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.165 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
you have to sit there

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and just stare at your food.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It just means paying attention
to what's going to distract you

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and what's not going
to distract you

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.473 align:middle line:84%
from getting that
satisfaction and tuning

00:13:33.473 --> 00:13:34.765 align:middle line:90%
in to that hunger and fullness.

00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Permission is a huge
piece of intuitive eating.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It's permission to eat,
enjoy it, and notice.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it still enjoyable?

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting to feel
physically uncomfortable?

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:10%
And if you are, sometimes
I will tell you,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.017 align:middle line:10%
you could be in Paris in
some incredible little cafe

00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:10%
and don't know that you're
ever going to be there again.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.767 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good, and you're
not going to bring half of it

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:90%
home to eat the next day.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So you may eat it
all, no judgment.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, come from
a place of curiosity,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
not judgment, be
self-compassionate.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Self-compassion is a big
part of intuitive eating.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So sure, go for it.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:90%
You walk away stuffed.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If it's happening every
day at all of your meals,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:90%
then it's something to look at.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.322 align:middle line:84%
There's a point at which
when we're eating, especially

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:25.405 align:middle line:84%
if there's an emotional
attachment to food-- which

00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I think is a gift.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.772 align:middle line:84%
I feel sad for people who
have no joy in eating.

00:14:29.772 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a point at which if
you're eating a wonderful meal,

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
food on that plate

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
is more than your
body needs, there's

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
this point at which it
doesn't taste as good,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting to feel
full, not stuffed but full.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:90%
And a sadness emerges.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.217 align:middle line:84%
And that's not, to me, deep,
emotional pain like depression

00:14:50.217 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
or something that
someone goes through

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:90%
in very difficult times.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a momentary
feeling that shows up.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's anytime we are stopping
something that's enjoyable,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:90%
we feel a moment of sadness.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:90%
The biggest one for me is books.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a real book reader.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.035 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
a wonderful book,

00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm getting
close to the end,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and I want to know how it ends.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm so
sad that it's over.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very human to
have that moment of sadness.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I help people accept it,
stay with it for a moment,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and recognize they're going to
get to eat again several times

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Move on, do something else, and
it, you know, it dissipates.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:90%
We're all meant to move.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
If we can, if we
have the privilege

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of being able to move our
bodies, we are meant to move.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.865 align:middle line:84%
Can we find a way
that feels joyous?

00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
What can you do, that's
going to feel good to you?

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't have to be--

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, it's often a
good idea if it isn't-- some

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:90%
programmed exercise.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a concept called
NEAT, non-exercise activity

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:90%
thermogenesis.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
how you move your body

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:90%
without it being exercised.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
If I run up the
stairs, that's NEAT.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
If I'm bringing groceries in
from the car, that's NEAT.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Movement can simply
be just those things

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that you do in your life
that are part of life,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:90%
and they help you feel better.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's helping people look
at what their belief is

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
about movement,
whether they believe

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not worth it if you're not
sweating and haven't run five

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
miles, whether they're resisting
it because as children, they

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.665 align:middle line:84%
were pushed to exercise
because really, they knew

00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that their parents
had an agenda,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
or they were afraid they
were gaining too much weight.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it that they're
getting older,

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can't do the
same kinds of things

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
they did when they
were young, and they

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:90%
don't want to face their age?

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it that they have some sort
of disability that's come up,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and they can't do what
they used to be able to do?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what
is causing you

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to resist this incredible,
wonderful experience that each

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.155 align:middle line:84%
of us can have in
any way we can.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things
that are philosophical,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
certain things that have deep
religious meaning to people.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
And if that is
important to them,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and they choose to, for example,
in Orthodox Judaism where

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
people are not supposed to eat
meat and milk at the same time,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
it can be a struggle if they're
trying to make peace with food.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it
means a lot to them

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to keep the commands that
they've committed to,

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
so they actually don't
feel deprived in that area.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
All I know about specifically
is my own religion,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
but I know that a
rabbi will tell someone

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
who is healing from
an eating disorder

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have to follow
the rules during that period,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that what's most important is
that they nourish themselves,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not to fast on the Jewish
holiday of Yom Kippur

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:90%
where you fast all day.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, absolutely,
my rabbi will say,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
if you have an eating
disorder, you eat, please.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very strongly
philosophically vegan.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
feeling deprived

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
because this is something
that has deep meaning

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:90%
to them at a spiritual level.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.542 align:middle line:84%
It's only when people are trying
to eliminate certain things

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
just because they
think they should

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
or because they'll lose
weight that it's a problem.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have respect
for people's philosophy

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I was at a dinner one
night among friends.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Four of them started
talking about,

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
ugh, I've just got to
lose that 10 pounds.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Or, it was great at
my wedding, but now

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I've gained weight since then.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.418 align:middle line:84%
And I stood up, and
I said to them--

00:18:31.418 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:90%
they're all good friends.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, this has to stop.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Each of you is doing so many
wonderful things in the world

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and is so special
in so many ways.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Why are you continuing to
beat yourself up for weight?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really,
take a look at that.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It's ruining your life.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So I do speak up wherever
I can even among friends.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And it makes me sad.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It makes me sad that so many
people are holding themselves

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
back in so many ways because
they think their bodies don't

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:90%
meet up to certain standards.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
There's so many wonderful things
to do in life and think about.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And so much of mental
energy is taken up in,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
oh no, I ate too much
of that, or, my body

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is it's not fitting
into that pair of pants

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
that I wore last year.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's be a little more
generous with ourselves

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the way
we look at ourselves

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and just appreciate that we
have a body and that we're alive

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and what can our
bodies do and get away

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
from that perfectionism.
