one of the things I'll ask

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:10%
the audience is, how
many of you are mothers,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:10%
and how many of you have had the
experience of when your child

is up to no good
or in harm's way,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, something has
to connect them.

When you go to the
doctor's office,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
they put electrodes across
your heart, your chest,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
or you can measure
brainwaves, put electrodes

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
on the scalp, what
you're measuring is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
current flow, the
flow of electricity.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
the electrocardiogram.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course, the
heart is the largest

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
source of rhythmic electrical
energy in the body, by far.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.753 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
just basic physics

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that whenever you have a
flow of electrical current,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:90%
you create a magnetic field.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Whenever the heart beats,
you create a magnetic field.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's interesting
that in oriental medicine,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:10%
the heart is kind of the
center of the energy system

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:10%
and the brain is not even
considered much in oriental

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:10%
medicine compared to the
West, where we think this is

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:10%
regulating it all.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> With today's magnetometers,
you can measure the cardiac

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
field, the field produced
by the beating heart,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
about three feet from the body,
where you lose sensitivity.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The field goes much
farther, of course.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just the sensitivity
of the measuring instrument.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And you can do the same thing.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
You can measure brainwaves
external to the body as well,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
but you lose sensitivity
with the same instrument

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
about an inch away
from the head.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, three
feet, an inch--

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
the heart field
is the big player

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
energetically or magnetically

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our biologically
generated magnetic fields.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
We all use magnetic fields
every day to communicate.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
smartphones, right?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So I often ask the
question, well,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:84%
how does the
information-- when you're

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
on your phone, your voice
or the text message,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
picture, or whatever, get from
your phone to the cell tower?

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's an
electromagnetic field

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that carries that
information from your phone

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:90%
to the cell tower.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And phones work inside.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So we know that--

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that, but
they don't necessarily

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:90%
think about it.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's the magnetic
component in particular

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:90%
that goes through the walls.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You can even be in an elevator
and your phone will work.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
When the heart beats, and
that magnetic field easily

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
goes right through
the skin and radiates

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:90%
into the space around us.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can think of this as our
personal field environment.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We're sending energy out into
the universe that's impacting

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
other living critters, other
persons and animals and plants.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You might say it's
our auric field.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, I watched
the film "Conversations

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:84%
with God," which has its
uplifting moments and then

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
its dramas of
homelessness, et cetera.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I watched my emotions
go on a roller coaster

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
with our dynamic
emotional detector.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And with this detector,
nothing is hooked on my body.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting four, five, six
feet away from the detector.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And so my auric
field is affecting

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that detector, which
is also shielded

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:90%
from all conventional energies.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So that means human beings
have an emotional field that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
goes out from the body that
impacts other critters.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And there are lots of
support for this suggestion.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.553 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to get five groups
of 20 people in each group.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
are sitting in a room

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
together for 30 days
meditating or something.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
They were going about
their normal lives.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:10%
We had one here in California,
a group in Saudi Arabia,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:10%
a group in Lithuania, a group in
New Zealand, and one in the UK.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
They wore these devices for 30
days that recorded their heart

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.013 align:middle line:84%
rate variability, the
beat-to-beat change in heart

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
rate, which actually
reflects the activity

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:90%
in their nervous system.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart does not
beat like a clock ticks.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
If it does, that's
not a well heart.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a sick heart.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The heart shows some
level of variability

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:90%
in its beating pattern.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It beats a little faster
when you breathe in

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and a little slower
when you breathe out.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
The greater the heart rate
variability, the healthier

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic nervous
system and the heart.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most common
way, really, to monitor stress,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
is through autonomic measures
of heart rate variability.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We organized for all of those
groups globally to synchronize

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
a time that they all did
a 15-minute heart-based

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
meditation, which we
call a heart lock-in.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the HeartMath
techniques, where you really

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
kind of lock into the heart.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
You pretend you're
breathing through the heart

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to get the coherent
rhythm going.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But then you activate sincere
feelings of appreciation

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and genuine connection, and
then consciously radiate

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that to yourself and others.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So we all did this together,
all the five groups,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
When we time-synchronized
the data, what we found

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
was just jaw-dropping.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
After 15 minutes of us being
in a coherent state personally,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the slow rhythm in
people's heart rhythms

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
are synchronizing, even across
vastly different time zones.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.835 align:middle line:90%
This is a global phenomenon.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
This actually was
puzzling to us.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were
so shocked by it.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And as good scientists, we
tried to make it go away,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
do all the double-checks
and things, and couldn't.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
could really explain it

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
was that they're all
synchronized to another signal

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that they're all exposed to,
the rhythms of the Earth's

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.745 align:middle line:90%
magnetic field.

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've heard
so many times people

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, on some
level, we're all connected.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing here with the
Earth human magnetic research,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.508 align:middle line:84%
I think, gives us a
plausible mechanism.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying this is the
only way we're interconnected,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly
one that appears to be

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:90%
very real and very measurable.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we're all connected to
the field, like I'm suggesting,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
feeding information into the
field, well, that's how mom--

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and/or dads too, can
have that same thing--

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:90%
are connected to their children.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And what tunes our
inner receivers,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
just kind of like the cell
phone, is what we care about.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We tend to be tuned in
to the information--

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
we pull the information
from the field--

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of the people that are
close to, us that we love,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:90%
that we care about.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
What a mess it would be if moms
were tuned in to the however

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:90%
many billion kids there are.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, again,
it's our emotional systems

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that tend to attune us to the
emotional-- to the information

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
of interest out of
the global field.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:10%
that space between the
Earth and the ionosphere.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And lightning strikes all the
time somewhere on the planet.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>> You can think of the resonant
space within our atmosphere

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:10%
the same as the resonant
space in a violin or a guitar.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's a particular shape
and it's a particular size,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:10%
and it's constantly being
stimulated by the solar wind.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The solar wind beats on
the edge of our ionosphere

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
like a hand beats on
the skin of a drum.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So the sun is endlessly
and continually creating

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
what are called
micropulsations, which

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:84%
are a full spectrum
of natural resonances

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:90%
that we then live in.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:10%
So because the speed of light
and the depth of that cavity

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:10%
and the distance
around the Earth,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:10%
the primary standing
wave that establishes

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:10%
is 7.83 waves per second.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So think sitting on a beach,
watching waves hit the beach.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
If 7.83 of those hit
the beach every second,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
you'd be listening
to Schumann wave.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The cool thing about
the Schumann resonance is

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
it's right at the threshold of
the theta and alpha brainwave

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:10%
>> When we close
our eyes and relax,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:10%
we go down to about
8 hertz brain waves.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:10%
So in other words, we
seem to recapitulate,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:10%
or we're in sync with Mother
Earth at our lowest ground

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:10%
state level of consciousness,
closing the eyes

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:10%
and going inward.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The frequencies of
consciousness, the beta, alpha,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
theta, and delta, those
are actually literally four

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
octaves, and the midpoint
is the Schumann resonance.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So we think, feel,
physiologically

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
have a vibration intelligence,
two octaves below

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
and two octaves above Schumann.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a research project
that shows that it entrains all

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:10%
the brains on the planet
into that threshold of theta

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:10%
and alpha, which
gives us a stable,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:10%
consistent brainwave state.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We share that communal
resonance literally with

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
the planet, because it is
the planet's resonance.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that's
established itself here

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:90%
has to be tied to that.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's been doing it for
hundreds of millions of years.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of addicted
to it, so much so

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't get
it, you can get sick.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
They actually give it to
astronauts electromagnetically.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most important
frequency on our planet.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not really the
frequency of our planet.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a frequency
in the atmosphere.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's the number
one vibration

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:90%
that we are in tune to.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like nature.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
To get back to it is like a
way of reconnecting to nature.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's really one of the
most important brainwave

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
frequencies, even.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's eight
Schumann resonances.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:10%
And Schumann was a
German mathematician

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.015 align:middle line:10%
who predicted the
existence of these.

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:10%
So they're named after him.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:10%
That's why that name.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:10%
There's eight of them.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:10%
First one is 7.83 hertz,
then 14, 20, and so on.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It turns out all eight of
the Schumann resonances

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
overlap with human brainwaves.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So what did I just say?

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The two primary magnetic
systems and rhythms of Earth

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
overlap exactly our heart
rhythms and our brain rhythms.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really
fascinating-- and I

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
don't know if this means
anything or not yet.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.882 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
observation.

00:11:38.882 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, earlier,
I talked about how

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the heart's the big field,
three feet, brainwave an inch,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can measure
magnetically.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
ratio at Earth scale.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So the field line
resonances, which

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the heart,
are many orders of magnitude

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
larger than the
Schumann resonances.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same kind of
ratio at Earth's operating

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:90%
at as humans are operating at.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But the reason this
is important, I think,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to understand is, again,
if we time travel back

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.905 align:middle line:84%
to science class, we know if
you take two tuning forks tuned

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to the same
frequency and you tap

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.905 align:middle line:84%
one, the other
starts to vibrate,

00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:15.998 align:middle line:84%
or two guitar strings
tuned to the same note.

00:12:15.998 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's used to
demonstrate what's

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:90%
called resonant coupling.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So with our tuning
forks, guitar strings,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and so on, what's mediating that
energy transfer between the two

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
tuning forks is air molecules,
just like I'm talking now.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm vibrating air,
and it's creating

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
waves that go through the air
to the microphones or people's

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.980 align:middle line:90%
ears and you hear it.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's the same thing
with the tuning forks.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:10%
Systems that vibrate
at the same frequency,

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:10%
you can transfer energy and
information between them.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.078 align:middle line:84%
Well it works exactly the
same way with magnetic fields,

00:12:48.078 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
only you don't need
the air molecules

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.017 align:middle line:90%
to mediate the effect.

00:12:51.017 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, cell phones again.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a cell phone.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
These invisible magnetic
waves are all around us.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
How does my phone transfer
the energy and information

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:90%
from the one that we want?

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, you literally
tune the circuitry

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
in the phone, the
receiver, to be resonant

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:90%
with the frequency of interest.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we do
that, voila, you

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
transfer the energy
and information

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
from these invisible waves
into the phone, amplify it,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're having
our conversation.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying,
it's the same thing.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Our brains and hearts are
operating at the same frequency

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
as the primary rhythms in
the Earth's magnetic field,

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:90%
which we all live within.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So to circle back
around to how I started,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting,
through resonance,

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
our hearts and brains are
coupled to the Earth's field.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that's actually testable.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
studies now, that this

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is beyond a hypothesis, that
the fields we live within,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's magnetic fields and
the rhythms and disturbances

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:90%
in those fields, affect humans.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly
have-- different people

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
have different
sensitivities to it.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:90%
But we're all affected by it.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So when the magnetic
fields of Earth

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.002 align:middle line:84%
are disturbed, for example,
through a solar flare

00:14:05.002 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
hospital admissions

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
go up for a wide range
of health conditions.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
People tend to be more edgy,
don't sleep as well, kind

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
of wake up more
frustrated or edgy feeling

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of reason
that you can trace it to.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
These are all things that go on.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm suggesting it's really a
two-way street, that we're also

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:90%
feeding the field.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of our slogans
within the Global Coherence

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.013 align:middle line:84%
work, is to consider, what
am I feeding the field?

00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
What's the information
I'm putting

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
into my local field,
which then is coupled

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.525 align:middle line:90%
to the big field of the Earth?

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> According to quantum
theory, the new physics,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
the universe may be
gargantuan, but it's in us.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Not only are we in the
universe, the universe

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:10%
is in us, because
everything that

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:10%
makes the universe
what it is today,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:10%
we would call it
all the information,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:10%
all the energy
flows, is actually

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:10%
reflected in every
cell of our body,

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:10%
in every atom in every cell,
because we are interconnected.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an ecological
connection in which

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
there's an interdependence
of large systems.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
But this is deeper than that.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:10%
This is saying that
it is not simply

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:10%
that we are interdependent
on each other,

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:10%
but that there's aspects of
you and aspects of me which

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:10%
are literally the same thing.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be separated
in space and time,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
but that's only because
we're kind of embedded in it.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:84%
We see things, in
an everyday sense,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:90%
as though we're separated.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:84%
At a deeper level, that actually
may not be the case at all.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an entirely
new way of thinking.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's also a very old way,
because the great thinkers

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
of antiquity, the Buddhists,
for example, the Taoists,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:90%
knew this.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And they considered the universe
as an interconnected whole

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.295 align:middle line:84%
which is suffused
by a higher spirit.

00:15:59.295 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have a group of people
out there who are suffering,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
that is affecting you.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Whether you even
know it or not, it's

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
affecting you, because
you're part of that.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you understand
that somebody else's suffering

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.233 align:middle line:84%
is your suffering,
literally, then well

00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
what are you going
to do about it?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not even limited
to life on Earth.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like life in the
universe, perhaps,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
or maybe just the
universe in general.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So it is so big it's hard
for our little pea brains

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to grasp it, but that
would be the implication

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of
interconnectedness

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as we know, this
universe is a single resonated

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
field in which all things
are connected with all other

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It gives us an
entirely different view

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
from the standard classical view
of a material universe where

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:84%
bits and pieces
of matter are just

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:84%
moving about in passive
space and indifferent time.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:10%
>> So if I wish to use my
attention to pay attention,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:10%
in a focused way, to something
which is far away from me,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:10%
then it's conceivable that
there's portions of my brain,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:10%
my physical brain, which
are actually there,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:10%
in the same way that a quantum
particle can be here and there

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We reflect the universe
because we are connected to it.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:90%
We are part of it.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
These concepts are
so basic, so large,

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can't simply deduct
them reduce them or derive them

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:90%
from something else.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:90%
They are fundamental.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And then beyond that, it's
like the causal realm where

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:10%
your life purpose resides, all
your memory of other lifetimes

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:10%
and the whole history
of the planet, really.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
What they call the Akashic
Records is out there.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all one big thing.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big collective
consciousness at that level.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The Akasha was the dimension
the Hindu seers talked about.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
They said there are the four
regular dimensions, air, water,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:90%
fire, and earth.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:10%
They called this the
standard dimension,

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:10%
but they said there is a higher
or deeper dimension, if you

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:10%
like, which includes
all the others.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:10%
This is beyond all the others.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:10%
It includes all the others.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the deep dimension.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Later on, Plato himself
talked about this

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
as a platonic dimension of
the soul of consciousness.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I do think that there is
an energy version of every

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
physical thing, just
like Plato said.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a non-physical
energy pattern

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that is inside of every
physical thing that

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:90%
gives rise to that form.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like a blueprint
for a house.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
You follow it.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It creates the house
in its physical version

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:84%
of the two-dimensional
blueprint.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Akashic field
is the universe.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's how the universe
appears to us.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
When we inquire how
things are connected,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
how things are conserved,
we find the answer today.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum science says
all things are connected

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to all other things, and
nothing disappears completely

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:90%
without a trace.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can call it the
universe as it appears

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
in the quantum sciences.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an Akashic
universe, you might say.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We are not just physical
matter, so to speak.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the old Newtonian view.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:10%
We are created by an
underlying, invisible quantum

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:10%
field of interfering waves.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:10%
And that brings a
completely new perspective

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:10%
to spirituality, to healing, and
to many other things as well.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:10%
Quantum theory, as it was
developed about 100 years ago

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:10%
by Max Planck, Albert
Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Erwin

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:10%
Schrodinger, was really a
theory about quantum phenomena

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:10%
on the microcosmic,
subatomic level.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:84%
As I have found,
that will not suffice

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
the big-scale evolution

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and how we
humans fit into it ourselves.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a big step between
a little electron

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that the original pioneers
of this science were studying

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and how humans
relate to each other.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>> I do feel, intuitively,
as a scientist,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:10%
there's a whole realm of reality
that's giving rise to this

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:10%
physical realm.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have some
concepts, for example,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
from quantum physics
that would go along

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:90%
with that theoretically.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So we can think of it
as a sea, and we're only

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:90%
able to see the waves.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the
infinite potential

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
of this vast sea of energy.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We only see the individual
waves popping up

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:90%
into physical existence.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The Maya actually developed
a macrocosmic quantum theory

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to understand human life in the
big perspective and how that

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:90%
evolved.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids that
they built, they

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
were not the smooth
kind of pyramids

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that you find in Egypt
or many other places.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They were built as terraces.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And each of these terraces--
nine of them, almost always--

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
represents a level of
consciousness, you might say.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Each of them is also developed
by a particular wave,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:90%
a wave of creation.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:10%
When you climb one of
those pyramids, which

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:10%
is what their shaman kings
would do thousand years ago,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:10%
the step from one of these
terraces to the other

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes a quantum
leap between one aspect

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:10%
of creation, one state of
consciousness, to another.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
When you start to look upon
history in this perspective,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
things happen independently
in separate locations.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You have pyramids being built in
Peru or in Mongolia or in Egypt

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're downloading
a new mind, actually.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:84%
What makes the Maya stand out
among all ancient traditions

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
is that they had numbers.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:90%
They had a calendar.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Whenever there is a significant
shift date, a wave shift,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in
the Mayan calendar,

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:90%
we can see when that happened.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We can see, how does that
fit with the evolution

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:90%
of various phenomena?

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The sixth wave that was
activated 3115 BCE, people

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
went from Stone Age to
building pyramids in Egypt

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:90%
in maybe seven generations--

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, almost nothing.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It happened like this.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model
also makes us--

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to wonder about
something that might have been

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
before or anything like that,
because if it's a quantum

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
shift, it is bound to happen
suddenly, instantaneously,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the characteristics

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:90%
of quantum theory.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Quantum leaps happen
instantaneously.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:90%
The seventh wave, 1755.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
One thing, obviously, at
that time that happened

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:90%
was the Industrial Revolution.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Another was the attraction
to republics and democracies,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:84%
basically-- the
ideals, at least,

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
started to manifest
then in the American

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:90%
and the French revolutions.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
That whole process had
been going on ever since.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
People think that, oh, I
did this, or I did that,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we did.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And there's some truth to that.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we play a
role as co-creators.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But we did not create
the quantum state

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that allowed these changes
to happen in the first place.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that everything
that ever happened is here

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:10%
to influence what
is happening now.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe that
it determines what is

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:10%
going to happen in the future.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I think this universe
has a degree of freedom.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Things can be created.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Things can evolve.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Things can be decided yet.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:90%
We can create the future--

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:90%
not without limits, of course.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It has to be built on what
has already been there.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But the past does not
determine the future.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The future is determined by
how we interact in the present,

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:90%
together, all of us.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
That means all beings
in space and time,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:84%
through their
interaction, create

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.415 align:middle line:90%
the world that is coming to be.

00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The dowsing tool acts
as an informational bridge,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And most people think of
dowsing as finding water.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.417 align:middle line:84%
That's the typical
images of the chap

00:24:57.417 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
with the forked sticks striding
across the field looking

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:90%
for a water supply.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:10%
But dowsing is just a means
of accessing our intuition.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:10%
It enables us to tune
into our subconscious,

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:10%
and we can tap into other
sorts of energy fields as well.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
We're here today at the
world's largest stone circle,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.673 align:middle line:90%
which is Avebury in Wiltshire.

00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be exploring
some of the Earth energies

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that we find here on this
lovely British summer's day.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
In the 18th century,
antiquarian William Stukeley

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
did the first drawing and
the first survey of the site,

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.963 align:middle line:84%
and he called it the great
serpent temple of Wiltshire.

00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
there are two avenues

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of stones that led from the
circle down to smaller sites.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that it
was a ceremonial site.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The number of stones
here is quite impressive.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a really impressive feat
of megalithic engineering.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
dowsers because it

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is almost in the center of
what's called the Michael line.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
alignment of sites that

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
runs from Southern Cornwall all
the way up to Norfolk, where

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:90%
it enters the sea at Hopton.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's a straight
alignment that

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:84%
connects many sites such as
Glastonbury Tor, Avebury, Bury

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:90%
St. Edmunds Abbey, and so on.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And around this site, we
have the Michael and the Mary

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.590 align:middle line:90%
currents.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And one's called male and
one's called a female current.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And here, the two currents
interact and connect

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
at two or three points
throughout the circle

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:90%
before they go on their way.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But these are the things that
dowsers are interested in.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth meridian, which
we traditionally call dragons,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:90%
might be 40 feet wide.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
In scientific terms, these
are called telluric currents

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and Schumann waves.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:10%
So they are recognized, but the
old-fashioned talk about them

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:10%
was as dragons, which I find
more poetic, and actually more

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:10%
engaging to the imaginal mind.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The dragons, as it were,
or the meridians, really

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
are the flux lines
of a toroidal field.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.552 align:middle line:84%
On the human body, we map
them only on the surface,

00:26:52.552 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
but actually, if we look
at the toroidal field,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
we have wings that go out
and those meridian lines

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:84%
are just the surface
pathway of something

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that then goes out and includes
a vibrational space around us.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're very familiar with
how that looks on the Earth.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got a North/South Pole
and a magnetic field around it.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what holds
the atmosphere in

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and the solar radiation out.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So the dragons hold
the place together.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got Earth
and air and fire and water,

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is the Platonic division
of those fixed states,

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're all obviously
vibrational states.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And those create our
perceptual environment

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that we can move, in a
physical way, through.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
We're fish in an ocean of
vibration, as it were--

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
vibrational bubbles in
a vibrational ocean.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> When I met some dowsers from
the British Society of Dowsers

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
in 1999--

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
this was down in Cornwall
at the solar eclipse.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that all
these things that I was doing

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:90%
could all be called geomancy.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Geo means anything
to do with the Earth,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and anything -mancy
means divination.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so chiromancy, for
example, is palm reading.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Taromancy would be card reading.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And so generically,
geomancy simply

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:90%
means divination of place.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So it relates to accessing the
vibrational energetic spirit

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligence of the
physical environment.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Dowsing is a tool that
allows us to detect things,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
like these Earth energies
that we look for.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Geomancy is how we apply them.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can manipulate
these energies

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and we can attract them to
enhance the energies of an area

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.995 align:middle line:84%
or get rid of any
detrimental energies.

00:28:35.995 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
Western Feng Shui,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:84%
is the easiest way
to describe it.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Coming through
here, down the site,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
we have both the
Michael and Mary lines

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:90%
running right down the site.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.272 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to see if I
can pick up the nearest one.

00:28:47.272 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
A little bit tricky in the
wind here with these rods.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's try.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking for the
center of the current.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the currents.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.023 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure which one.

00:28:58.023 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I can ask questions
of the rods as well.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So I say, is this
the Michael current?

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And the rods cross,
which is a yes for me.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Michael.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So the next one I come across
should be the Mary current.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.013 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can
find the center of that.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is the center of the
line that I'm dousing here.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, these can be
several meters wide.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.555 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just carry on
and ask for the edge.

00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just focusing and looking
for the edge of the line here.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Dowsing is all about
the mental focus.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
And here it is, here.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can see this is probably
about six meters across here,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And these two lines come
right down through the henge,

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and they go off and they
split and they go and connect

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.808 align:middle line:84%
other areas in the
Avebury complex.

00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And these flow all the
way from southern Cornwall

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
up to Norfolk, weaving in and
out of this straight alignment.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to try and
follow the Mary current here,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to find where
the two currents cross.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So if I look for the center
again, here's the center.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.525 align:middle line:84%
So I can just use one rod here
and I can follow the current.

00:30:01.525 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So the tip of the
rod kind of sticks

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the line.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And where it crosses with the
Michael current, this happens.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
called a node point.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You get a little rising
vortex of energy.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.205 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the Michael
and the Mary intersect.

00:30:28.205 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just at the entrance
to the main circle.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We can completely identify
the energy field of a person

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.520 align:middle line:84%
with the energy
field of a place.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever happens
to you when you go

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to your acupuncturist, they're.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Checking your pulses, they're
checking your chi flow,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at
different meridians.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference in
the energy field of a person

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and a planet except for scale.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:84%
The planet's just a
bigger body than we are.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
your acupuncturists

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
are doing, everything
that your energy workers,

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that your healers
are doing, we're

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
really doing that on the
planet, just adapting to scale.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I do literally use
needles, and they

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:84%
would be alarming if your
acupuncturist approached you

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I think we're seeing
needles of stone

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
all over Britain and old Europe
in the network of standing

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:90%
stones and stone circles.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
With the shift from
nomadism to agrarianism

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and wanting, then, to
manage landscape energies

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
for extending growing seasons,
increasing germination rates,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
enhancing health
and crops, they seem

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to get into an energetic
management system

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that sort of more
looks like tuning

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.920 align:middle line:90%
pegs on a musical instrument.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And so they left
their needles in,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:84%
probably adjusted them
regularly on a seasonal basis.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This is Saint James's
Church in Avebury.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that the church is not

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:90%
placed within the stone circle.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It's deliberately
placed outside.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.845 align:middle line:84%
Normally, in other
sites like this,

00:32:12.845 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
the church has

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:84%
been built over the
original pagan site

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:84%
as a way of taking
control of the energies

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and subsuming them into
Christianity, if you will.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But here, because
the circle is so big

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and the energies are
so strong, they've

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:84%
had to build it
outside the circle.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.093 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
church, and unfortunately, we

00:32:31.093 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
can't get in today,
because it's locked.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It has a Norman font dating
back to the 11th century,

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it is, which has
a wonderful carving on it

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of a bishop with
his miter slaying

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
two dragons around
the base of the font.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So he's pinning the heads of
the dragons into the ground.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is really a
metaphor for the act

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:90%
of foundation in geomancy.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
By building our sacred site on
these particular confluences

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
of dragon energies, we
fix the energies in place

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:90%
and we create our sacred site.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's what energizes the space.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.950 align:middle line:10%
>> In terms of the application
of this work in agriculture,

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:10%
best we can date around the
Avebury complex 6,500 years

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:10%
ago, 4500 BC.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:10%
And it seems like
that was then farmed

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:24.220 align:middle line:10%
sustainably until our
so-called Green Revolution,

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:10%
the move away from what we
would now consider organics

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:10%
towards enhancing crop
diet with chemical

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:10%
fertilizers, fungicides,
pesticides, and so forth.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Husbandry became
agricultural science.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And the qualities of traditional
farmers, as with so much

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in our culture, were
set aside perhaps

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:84%
as being of fantasy
or folklore or trivial

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:90%
or non-consequential.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is the
West Kennet Avenue,

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:10%
which is one of two avenues
of stones that once led from

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:05.752 align:middle line:10%
the Avebury circle.

00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The other one is called
the Beckhampton Avenue,

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%
but not much of that
survives now apart

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:90%
from a couple of stones.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
And this runs over a mile
from the main circle,

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
weaving through the
landscape up to a site called

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:84%
The Sanctuary, which is
a smaller circle that

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:90%
was probably just timber posts.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it had a roof on it.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So it seems clear
that this was probably

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a processional
route for entering

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
into the main circle, which
is why we think the Avebury

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
circle was a gathering
place, probably,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
a regular ceremony, maybe
at midwinter or midsummer

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
where thousands of people

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.699 align:middle line:90%
would gather.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So running down the
center of this avenue

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:90%
is the Michael current.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.699 align:middle line:84%
That's the male current
of the alignment.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And here it is here.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's the center of it.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.603 align:middle line:84%
And the width of it, if I just
go back and do that again--

00:34:52.603 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:84%
so we're looking for the edge
of the Michael current here.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's here.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.445 align:middle line:84%
So it's as wide as the
stones at this point.

00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
It's actually getting
wider as it comes down.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.028 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
check the other edge.

00:35:05.028 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's the
width of the avenue.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very typical of
these big, wide dragon lines.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We often find that
they are-- this

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.225 align:middle line:84%
is why we call
them dragon lines,

00:35:17.225 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
because they are so wide,
they are so energetic.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Normally, energy lays can be a
little bit narrower than this.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Typically, two to three
meters is about normal

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:90%
for an energy lay.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But these dragon lines are
very wide because they're

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:90%
so powerful.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.915 align:middle line:84%
The Michael alignment goes
all the way around the globe.

00:35:32.915 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a great circle that
goes right around the planet,

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and these dragon
lines weave in and out

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:90%
like snakes around a caduceus.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:84%
There are still several stones
in the main circle that remain

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.500 align:middle line:90%
buried beneath the ground.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:84%
In Victorian times
and earlier than that,

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
it was fashionable to try
and get rid of these pagan

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:90%
monuments.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So many of the
stones were broken up

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.123 align:middle line:84%
and incorporated into the
houses in the village, in fact.

00:35:55.123 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are still
several in the main circle

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:90%
that remain buried.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So geomancy is about
enhancing our relationship

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:90%
with the place.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:84%
We try and seek out
these environments that

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:90%
are beneficial to human life.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So much of the problems
we have these days

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is that people are
building houses and living

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:84%
over these unhealthy
Earth energies.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So the job of a
geomancer like myself

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is to come in and try
and neutralize or change

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
those energies to
more beneficial ones.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still quite
an emergent field.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:10%
When my parents
started their work,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:10%
there was so much
cultural prejudice.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Their kids weren't
allowed to play

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
with the minister
or doctor's kids

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because they were
obviously dangerous people.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:40.865 align:middle line:84%
And there was just a lot
of fear and worry about it.

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And now, pretty much
everybody's next door neighbor

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.430 align:middle line:90%
is a Reiki master.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> My work over
the last 25 years,

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
huge amount of it has
been helping people with

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
their domestic spaces.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization, at one point,

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:84%
declared that 30%
of our buildings

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
were sick buildings,
meaning that 20% or more

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of the occupants or inhabitants
were showing health or comfort

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:84%
problems relating
from the site itself.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Shocking.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Huge statistic.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of my work is helping
clients with commercial spaces.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.100 align:middle line:84%
If it's a sick commercial
space, then maybe it

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:90%
stands vacant without tenancy.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a high rate
of sick leave or turnover.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
vibe around it

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:84%
where people don't want to go
in and either eat or buy or do

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So that includes
many possible sources

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.240 align:middle line:84%
of environmental
stress, from air quality

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
to light quality to
electromagnetic fields.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But then also, in
my interest area,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
the geopathic stress
where the Earth energies

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.190 align:middle line:84%
are out of balance
or inappropriate.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The two main components
of the Earth energy picture,

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.570 align:middle line:84%
if you like the yin and the
yang, is water and energy.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Water is very yin energy.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So we find it's not good to
be sleeping over water lines

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:90%
or water sources.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:84%
This is typically an unhealthy
zone to be sleeping in.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it will
deplete your immune system

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and allow illnesses
to take hold.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, like sleeping
over an energy line

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
can be too much of a good thing.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We want these yang energies
in our sacred spots,

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:84%
like our churches and our
stone circles, our temples,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.687 align:middle line:84%
our meditation chambers,
even our workplaces,

00:38:20.687 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
but it's not good to have
them running through your bed,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.687 align:middle line:84%
because you would
have trouble sleeping.

00:38:24.687 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main
job of a geomancer

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:84%
in a day-to-day context, is to
try and balance these energies

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:90%
within the home.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:90%
We all have this ability.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:90%
You just have to unlock it.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So it really does open
doors in your mind.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage
everybody to take it up.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It really helps us get in
touch with our intuitive side

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and makes us more
aware of the world

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.730 align:middle line:90%
around us, which is all good.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And then comes
the ninth wave,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:90%
which was activated in 2011.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.880 align:middle line:10%
I think people are now only in
the process of downloading it

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:10%
slowly.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.110 align:middle line:10%
It certainly hasn't come
to any dominating role yet.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Some people are working on it.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the ninth wave
is meant to bring us back

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to a state of non-separation,
to a state of unity

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and no longer projecting
a duality, separations,

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:90%
on ourselves or on others.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And that has the
properties of the divine.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Billions of galaxies
and trillions of

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.370 align:middle line:84%
stars, and here we
are, like a speck

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of dust in all of this-- but
an important speck of dust,

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
with our own channel
to the divine.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Life is only possible if
every quantum, every particle,

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
in every cell of our body
cooperates with every other

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.060 align:middle line:90%
cell.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a primitive
universe in that sense.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It allows many things to happen.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
You are not forced
into a big wheel where

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:90%
you can only do one thing.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a lesson we
are now learning,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and we have to make use of it,
because we cannot just keep

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:84%
going, doing what
we have been doing.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what lead to more
and more breakdowns.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to go forward
and create a world

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:84%
where all people interact,
where all people can live,

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.950 align:middle line:90%
all people can flourish.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.680 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
The information is there.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Our technologies, properly
used, properly developed,

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:90%
can serve this.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
tremendous opportunity.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an exciting time to live.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.597 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't exchange it for
any other time in history.

00:40:43.597 --> 00:40:47.332 align:middle line:90%
