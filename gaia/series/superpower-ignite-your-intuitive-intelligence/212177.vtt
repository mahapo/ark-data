>> How do you blend the world
of intuitive intelligence with

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:84%
business in really practical
and effective ways?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So how do we actually leverage
our deeper intelligence

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
to actually read out what's
happening in the room for sales

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:84%
or for reading out the
needs of your customer?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you actually learn
to read out intuitively

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
what your team is actually
needing or anticipating

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:90%
the moment?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
There's so many applications
of intuitive intelligence

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.762 align:middle line:84%
And we're just at the
brink of discovering really

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.425 align:middle line:90%
the power of intuition.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about intuition,
we actually refer to it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:90%
in several different ways.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, it might be--

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:10%
I might be a visual intuitive.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:10%
What I mean by that is am I
reading your micro-expressions

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
of your face?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Am I reading your
gestures and your body

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
or how you're
moving in the world?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Am I noticing my
team in my business

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and that the energy
field is flat

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.603 align:middle line:84%
and no one's talking
to each other

00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
that they're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.392 align:middle line:90%
sitting on that I can tell?

00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I know I've been
in those meetings.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure maybe you
have too, where

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
someone sitting on the elephant
in the room and everyone

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
can feel it but no
one talks about it.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:90%
That happens all the time.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So visual intuitives
are one of the ways

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about
intuitive language.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Another one might
be audio intuitive.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So I might be
hearing certain words

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
or picking up on
what's not being said,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
which is equally powerful.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:90%
There's also a body intuitive.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So I might be actually sensing
in my gut, in my solar plexus,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:90%
in my heart, in my throat.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There might be certain
signals and cues

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that I recognize over time
of how I get information.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
We find that most people tend
to lead in one of those ways,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
whether they're audio,
body, or visual.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, where
all of those culminate

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is what we call a sense of
cognizance where I just know.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling of
knowing that overcomes me.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I just know something
is right in my bones.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So that might be coming
from all the clues

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.538 align:middle line:84%
with visual, audio,
body sensations.

00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
there's a feeling of,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, I just know
the right choice.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I know this relationship
is dead no matter

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
what we try to do to try
to fix it or heal it,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
or I know that this career
choice is the right one for me.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:90%
I just know it in my bones.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we talk
about with all this sense

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of cognizance.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Some people get prophetic
moments or conversations

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
they need to have through
their dream states

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
because that's where our
subconscious is doing the work

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and speaking to us.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed this
incredible business owner

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
who was a chocolatier.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
He would literally wake
up at 2:30 in the morning

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and see these schematics
for these pieces

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
of chocolate equipment
that actually

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:90%
don't exist on the market.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So he would wake up at 2:30 in
the morning in his dream state,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.893 align:middle line:84%
half awake, and literally write
the schematic, what he saw.

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when he woke
up in the morning,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
he'd start to build
this piece of machinery.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually brought
two pieces of equipment

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
to market that he actually
sells to other chocolatiers that

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:90%
had never existed before.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
He has a background in
chemistry and engineering.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But he was also open to his
subconscious and his intuition.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that's the
most powerful combination,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
when someone is open to
their critical thinking,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
their analysis,
their data crunching,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're open to their
experience and their deeper

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:90%
intuitive intelligence.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So let me tell you a story.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We were at a
conference on retreat.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was a fun
overnight weekend

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:90%
event where we were working.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:10%
So I was going to go take
a hot tub with a friend.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.908 align:middle line:10%
And I got out of my clothes
and into my bathing suit.

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:09.992 align:middle line:10%
And this was in the winter
in Northern California.

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty cold.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a towel
wrapped around me.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking
through the courtyard.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
And my friend comes back and
says, the hot tub is broken.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really
disappointed and in shock,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
like I can't not do
the hot tub right now.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
How am I ever going
to warm myself up?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe this.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
across the courtyard

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in the dark, somebody,
who I didn't know

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
from a different conference that
was also on the same ground,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
said in my direction
and I think to me,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
you should come
join our conference.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We're just hanging out in the
center here and socializing.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
what I wanted to do.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go in the hot tub.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
working, so then I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
was thinking I'm going
to go back in my room

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and have some time
alone and read my book

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and get warm under the covers.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So my initial
reaction was, no way.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.183 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that this
person was saying--

00:05:04.183 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
he was giving me some kind of
information that was useful.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.892 align:middle line:84%
I could just tell like I need
to pay attention to this.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
At that time of my life,
I was interested in making

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
more connections and
talking with people

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
at a level about
the work I'm doing

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
interested in about it.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
more likely then

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to happen if I go socialize
with these new people

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
than if I go to my
room and go to sleep.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So I had the strength of
mind to go change my clothes

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.498 align:middle line:84%
and get something warm on and
go over and introduce myself.

00:05:34.498 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
When I first walked in
the room, they said,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
you have to go talk
to this guy, Michael.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK because I
knew I was a physicist

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and this Michael had a
background in physics.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the
night we were talking,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
he was really interested
in what I was doing.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.367 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'd like you
to come speak to my group.

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:90%
We exchanged numbers.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And three months later, I got
an email from a friend of mine,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
not related to this
whole situation, saying,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
we want you to come
speak next week.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.327 align:middle line:90%
We have a cancelation.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:02.315 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
Michael suggested

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that you should come speak.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So they accidentally
knew each other

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
or synchronistically knew each
other, so they had me come.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that was
this redirection, constant

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:84%
redirection towards a goal
that I had to begin with.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But there was no way I could
have seen that looking forward.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I just had to follow
the information

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I was getting in the moment.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to let
you in on a secret.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:10%
If you want to manifest
something and you 90%

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:10%
fear you're not going to
get it and 10% you want it,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be pretty
much certain you're

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:10%
going to not get it and
get just the opposite.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
If you get 60-40, it'll
come in maybe with glitches,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
so if you're 60% good
desire, 40% fear.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
If you get to 10% fear-- you
don't have to be perfect--

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and 90% wide open
desire of the heart,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
it's likely to come quickly
with synchronicity, serendipity.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
My personal opinion
is we are creators.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're creating all the time
or manifesting all the time.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We use those words
interchangeably.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But we often do much
of that unconsciously.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
On the negative,
oh, I hope when I

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
go to the dentist I don't
have six fillings to fill.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:90%
We're putting the fear in there.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
On the positive, to really
imagine and visualize and put

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
energy through your
heart into something

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that truly you would
want and would serve you

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.625 align:middle line:84%
tends to help bring
that into physical form.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:10%
>> When you go into the imaginal
realm, or the unified field,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:10%
or the right brain, there is so
much there, so many variables,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:10%
so many possible realities you
could grab and pull in, you

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:10%
know?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you
place attention on a reality

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and merge with it.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You use your attention
to feel into it

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and to go in and
feel it more and more

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
until you can almost like step
into it like a little movie.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you can feel
what that reality is like.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as your
body gets the truth

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
of what it feels like, then
it can get excited about it.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts
actually materializing

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like the atoms and
particles rearrange themselves

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
into a different scenario
and there you go.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.415 align:middle line:10%
>> The choices we make are
actually seeding the universe

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to respond to us.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not predetermined.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
actually just random.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole branching
tree of possibilities.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I choose, I'm
going to get some kind

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.025 align:middle line:90%
of meaningful outcome from.

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:10%
>> If you smile at me now, I'm
probably going to smile back.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:10%
You helped create my smile.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:10%
If you stuck your
tongue out at me,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:10%
you would probably manifest
a different reaction.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> They always say the universe
takes care of the logistics.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's your job to imagine
it by placing attention

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:90%
on something and no willpower.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not intention.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It's attention which is
in the present moment.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And then things come
down and become real.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:90%
And that is creativity.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of creating
something, you take inventory.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And you say, wasn't that great?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I really had a good time.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Look at what I learned.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm bored.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So what else is there?

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And you let go.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And you let yourself float in
that kind of liminal space.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And then you go back out.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And somehow new ideas
start to come in.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is, am I acting
towards the things that I want

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
to create in the world?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Am I choosing from a place
of creativity and excitement

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
of things I want to create
and have happen and build?

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Or am I choosing from
a place of trying

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to make the right decision and
defending myself against all

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:90%
the wrong possibilities?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Either way, I'm going to
find myself navigating

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
this tree in a way that reflects
the kind of choices I make,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
either the excitement
or the worry.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As you move into this
area of how we manifest,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest things we
do is remove limiting beliefs.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Our culture teaches
nothing good comes

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
easy, no pain, no gain,
all kinds of beliefs

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
that have an element of truth.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
a concert pianist,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:90%
you probably should practice.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Some are easier to remove
because we don't like them,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, like
I don't feel special.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
That might create pain.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have beliefs
sometimes that we

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
swim in like a
fish in water that

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
feel what psychologists
call egosyntonic,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:90%
meaning we like the beliefs.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:90%
They make us feel good.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:90%
So I go to a group.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, how many of you in
the spiritual path are seekers?

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Most hands go up.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I say, wouldn't you
rather be a finder?

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a different energy.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So if a person's
holding seeking energy

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.447 align:middle line:84%
while they're trying
to manifest, that's

00:11:03.447 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
the water they're
swimming in, they'll

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
keep seeking and
seeking and seeking.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And they never get there.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:84%
If they change it to being a
finder, now it can come in.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is most times
it's free-choice universe.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
People, if it
doesn't work, think

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
they are undeserving
or untalented.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost never,
never, maybe never that.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
It's more that their beliefs
are such like they're

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:90%
holding on to be in a seeker.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's rolling with all
their efforts and energies

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:90%
as warrior and whatever else.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's this big ball of wax
that feels kind of legitimate,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm a seeker, you know?

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, great if that's your joy.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.905 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to be a
finder, different energy.

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that I'm
most passionate about is this

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:10%
idea that intuition
is not mystical.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It is not supernatural
and magical,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
even though it might have
those qualities at times.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually one of the
most grounded human experiences

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're having all the time.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about plugging into being
more aware in our environment

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:90%
internally and externally.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply, am I just aware
of the data that I'm receiving?

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more that I'm
become aware of that,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.058 align:middle line:90%
I can make better choices.

00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
That's a very simple way
that we explain it often

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in the business world.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
love about this day and age

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
is that science and neuroscience
is finally catching up

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:90%
with what we already know.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole neural
network, which is often

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:90%
called neural reception.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We literally have neurons in
almost every cell of our body.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
What's most important is
the three main brains,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:90%
is what they call it.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So we have our gut brain.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:90%
We have our heart brain.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:90%
And we have our head brain.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And these are the areas where
we have the most neurons stored,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
where we actually are
getting data in real time.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to actually
process information accessing

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
all of our brains to put on
the problem or the challenge

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're facing.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
If we're only coming
from our neck up,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:90%
it's actually very limiting.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
very limiting way

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
to approach today's
problems and challenges

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's literally
almost like 2D

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:90%
when you have 3D available.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.225 align:middle line:84%
When you're walking
into a room, when you're

00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
engaging with someone
new that you just

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
met, could be a client,
could be a colleague,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
if you're not tuning into
all of your experience,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
you're limiting the data
that you're receiving.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Our conscious thinking
can only pick up

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
on about 40 bits of
information per second.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
That seems like a lot,
40 bits per second.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So right now you're
aware of the sound

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.533 align:middle line:84%
of my voice, the lighting,
the background, what

00:13:40.533 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
you might be feeling
in your chair

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
right now, your own ambience,
maybe one thing on your mind,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe about up to
40 things per second

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:90%
that you can actually track.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind can track
20 million bits per second.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That's 40 bits versus 20
million bits per second

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.808 align:middle line:90%
of processing information.

00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:01.225 align:middle line:84%
Which one would
you rather choose?

00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So if intuition is so amazing,
why aren't we all doing it?

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there happen to
be a lot of roadblocks

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:90%
that get in the way.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've mapped
at least five obstacles

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that get in the way of you
tapping into your deeper

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the rational mind.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a good old
thinking up here.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
If I'm stuck in my logic, if I'm
stuck in how things should be,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm stuck in my
map that I've developed

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
of how I see the world and
my predictability that way,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to miss
all the signals

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:90%
and cues throughout the day.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to miss all
the pieces of information

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm receiving that
have nothing to do

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
with what's on my
spreadsheet or how

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
my brain works in that moment.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the
rational thinking

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is 500,000 times slower
than our subconscious mind.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
beyond the rational

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:90%
when we tune into our intuition.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Another way to
think about this is

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
when we're stuck in
our head, it only

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:84%
has two directions,
the past or the future.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's not present.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not in this
moment right now.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in our
head, we're either

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
rehashing something
that just happened

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
or we're imagining what
might happen in the future.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're not actually
in our living,

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
breathing experience
of right now.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
our intuition lives,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:90%
is in the present moment.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This is where
relationship is happening.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not tuned into
life in the present moment,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
we're not available
for what's happening.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
We're not available for the
information that's there.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The second obstacle is
having strong emotions.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Like fear is a
quintessential example.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm hijacked
by my fear, I'm

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
not coming from my
deeper intelligence.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not thinking clearly.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
All I see is red and
danger and caution.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:90%
It could also be overexcitement.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I might be
infatuated with somebody

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
or infatuated with a
situation or a new client

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that I miss all the red
flags that are there.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a different
kind of emotional hijack

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
when we have all of those
amazing hormonal sensations

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:90%
that are moving through us.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It literally is an
addiction at times.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And we don't see clearly.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why, once again,
emotional reactivity

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
is so different than
intuitive intelligence.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
A third obstacle that
gets in our way is doubt.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It is related to
rational thinking.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It's related to
thinking in general.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
But it has its own
special flavor to it.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's so crippling
that it's important to put

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the light on this one
also because so often we

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
know what we feel.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We know what's
happening around us.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:90%
But we doubt ourselves.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:90%
We second guess.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We think, well, no
one else is saying it.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Or my boss is not naming
what needs to happen next.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Who am I to say that
I think I know better?

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that kind of pay--

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:90%
the same pay grade as they do.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just the new guy.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
So how often do we do something
like that, where we disempower

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
ourselves because our inner
critic is our own worst enemy

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and we doubt what
we know to be true.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
Another common
obstacle is busyness.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm hustling.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.534 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving all the time.

00:17:20.534 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
My heartbeat, my attention
span is all over the place.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
There is no time to
actually sit and be still

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:90%
so that intuition can find me.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I need to actually
know in the moment,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even allowing
any space for that.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So the antidote that's
really important for busyness

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:90%
is how do I actually get still?

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
How do I take a
breath and slow down?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite things
when we're coaching executives

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is we get them to
literally do a tech detox.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you first
share that with them,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
they look at you like,
what are you talking about?

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.442 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy, literally.

00:17:57.442 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like a foreign language.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much more
freed up when they get away

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:90%
from the computer screen.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Steve
Jobs used to do at Apple.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:84%
He was famous for getting
away from the computer screen,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
walking around the Apple
campus in Cupertino,

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:90%
California, barefoot.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk barefoot, you
literally have to slow down.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:90%
You get into a different space.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:90%
You get into a different rhythm.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.462 align:middle line:84%
So I took a page from
Steve Jobs' book literally.

00:18:25.462 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with business
clients, a lot of times

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the executive, or
whoever I'm working with,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
outside the office.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go for a
walk around the block.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what
happens right away.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Immediately their
nervous system relaxes.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They get literally a
breath of fresh air.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They start to think about
whatever challenge they're

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:90%
sitting with in a new way.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
subconscious literally connects

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:90%
those dots in the background.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:10%
The fifth obstacle is ego.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:10%
This is where my own
bias or my own agenda

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:10%
gets in the way of
the wisdom of what

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:10%
really needs to happen next.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And the negotiation
is a classic example

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
where in any sales conversation,
am I coming from me, me, me?

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Or even if I'm trying to
impress people on my team

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and get the acknowledgment
of our shared boss

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
there, if I'm coming from
me, me, me, eventually, that

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
has a huge negative
repercussion.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And that damages relationships.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And intuition connects
you with the opposite.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
what's the we space?

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to
listen to that's

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:90%
in the greatest good for all?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Intuition, once
again, connects us

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
with our immediate
environment so much so

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel when something
feels off in the space.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I think about astronauts
that are going to deep space

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and how tuned in they need
to be with each other,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.965 align:middle line:84%
where if anything
is off, who knows?

00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Their life could
depend on that moment.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:10%
>> There's this word for what we
experience when we start paying

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:10%
attention to synchronicity,
when we start paying attention

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:10%
to the unexpected
situations in life.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We get into the
experience of flow,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
state of being where our mind
and our body and our heart

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and all the aspects of
ourselves are working together.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
a lot of our lives,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.233 align:middle line:84%
we're being dominated
maybe by our mind.

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking about how we're
going to solve some problem

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.567 align:middle line:84%
or how does someone
treat us know.

00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get vengeance, or
I'm going to try and apologize.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
All that's in our
mind, you know?

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Or we might be living
from her heart a lot

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
where we're really
open and loving.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Flow is about finding some
kind of balance where you're

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:84%
moving naturally between these
different elements of who

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Stop thinking.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Stop naming and identifying
and classifying.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to sit
still and listen.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:10%
I think that would be
the most important thing.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:10%
Be open.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:10%
Stop judging.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Be willing to admit
that you don't know.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just
being in openness.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Let go of any fear that
you have associated

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
with it because that's
going to get in the way.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And have fun.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If we try to
take more control,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
we might kind of
screw things up.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.125 align:middle line:84%
When we try and
clamp down on making

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
sure everything goes just right,
things can tend to fall apart.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So then we give up
and say, I'm going

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to let go totally and
just let it all happen

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
however it happens, surrender.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that also can
make things screw up.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm being colloquial here.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a spectrum
of how we're always

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
striving to find the
right amount of control

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we can influence
our lives to be good,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to make good choices,
to make our life better.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Flow is about jumping
off of that spectrum,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:84%
transcending that dynamic where
you become not worried about

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%
whether you're in control.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It's like being a child again.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking,
oh, I shouldn't

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:90%
tell my parents what to do.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be bossy, or
I should do what they say,

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
or you're not thinking about,
I should be good or bad.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
You're just being who
you are and there's

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:90%
a natural flow to it.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying we
should be like children.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We should be adults who
have grown capacities

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
for reasoning and for
wisdom and for compassion

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and yet remember what
it was like to be

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
in that space of our actions
come naturally through us.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:10%
>> And the other part
of the flow is about--

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:10%
at least for me, it's
about being in the moment

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:10%
as much as I can and just
responding to what comes.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:10%
But also I've gotten
into this thing where

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:10%
I talk about notice
what you're noticing,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:10%
that we have this thing, I
call it the inner perceiver.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people might call it the
Holy Spirit or the inner voice.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a sequence
of thoughts and noticings

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's different for everyone.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So I try to notice
what I'm showing myself

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:90%
and then say, well, why?

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Why did I just
notice that thing?

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And then I look at it.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what's the message?

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
What am I trying to get
through to myself from my soul

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:84%
through my mind into
my earthly self.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And I made a game of that.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But I really think that
noticing those things

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and engaging with
them is the flow.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's more than just
being in flow in our own little

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
cocoon.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Where synchronicity shows up is
who you accidentally bump into.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And that suddenly you're part
of a bigger network of what's

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:10%
And your life and your choices
and your experience of flow

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:10%
connects with somebody else's.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times and a lot of
what I teach and what I focus on

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
is how obstacles and
difficulties are absolutely

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:90%
a part of this picture.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
When you truly see the
world through this lens

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and really accept that this
is a process which is going on

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's trustworthy,
then I find

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I can start to trust the events
that happen in my life more

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and more as useful
for me, maybe even

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:90%
necessary for my own growth.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>> So often where intuition gets
a bad rap is it starts to get

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:10%
very much into the woo-woo
language and magical thinking.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say I'm on a date

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:90%
and I see three doves go by.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
think, oh, that's the sign.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
She's my woman forever.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:90%
That's it right there.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Prince was right.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Why I think most people
don't trust their intuition

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
is because they don't trust
their emotional volatility.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't trust the ups
and downs of what they feel.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably actually
smart to not always trust

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in a state of
depression, a state of anxiety,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:90%
a state of stress.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
In functional MRIs, when we're
having an emotionally reactive

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
moment, that's when
our amygdala is

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:90%
getting lit up way back here.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But when the intuitive
moments are actually

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
happening in our life,
there's a mixture of emotion

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and our decision making
center over here.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually literally
tuning into all of my signals

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:90%
and cues in my whole body.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important to slow down.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important to
breathe because the breath is

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
the thing that gets us to
lower the elevator back

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:84%
down into our other brains that
we're usually not inhabiting

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.845 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
learn how to lower

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
our awareness and
our consciousness

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
in our whole bodily
container, we're

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
walking in the world
more integrated,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:90%
connected with our self.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, connecting on
a deeper level with other.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge asset in the
business world and in life too.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.710 align:middle line:90%
[CALM MUSIC]

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
My sense is that the
newer generations

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
are even more open and tuned
into their emotional body, more

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
open and tuned into their
energetic and intuitive bodies

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and awarenesses.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet the challenge
is there's also

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
more social media and
technology in ways

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can distance from the
person-to-person interaction,

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's dating
apps or whether it

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is remote training with
your team in business

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.465 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you've actually
never met the person, your team

00:26:15.465 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:84%
member who's in
Germany or Mexico

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:90%
or wherever they're located.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You've actually never
really been across

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:84%
from them at a
table where you have

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the whole somatic experience
of being in front of them.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
with intuition

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:84%
is you can still pick up
what's being said or not said

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:84%
or get all kinds of information
on a video, of course,

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
even on telephone.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And even through
email, when you start

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to practice developing
your intuition,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:84%
you can actually pick up
certain emotions or energetics

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:90%
in email.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's obvious
is if it's all caps

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
or if there's a lot
of exclamation points

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.923 align:middle line:84%
or something like that
that can give you a sense.

00:26:50.923 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
As you start to
tune in, you start

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to actually can feel
a little bit more

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
what's behind a
message, what's actually

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.035 align:middle line:84%
the intention behind a message
that's being sent to you.

00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What about this idea
of thinking positive?

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Fake it till you make it.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
More modern culture would
be, be positive out there.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:10%
That's that stiff
upper lip thing

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.080 align:middle line:10%
taken to another level of not
only you have to look stoic,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:10%
but now you have to look
really happy about it.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And it gets to a
place where you can't

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
trust the smile
of the guy selling

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
you the used car, or lady.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
You can't trust
the smile you see

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
in business because somebody may
just want something from you.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're acting extra
friendly, extra nice, extra

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
loving, extra positive.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Our intuitive sense really
can smell that a mile away.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we're designed to be
unlimited energy beings getting

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:84%
all our energy
directly from source,

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
however you define
that, God, beauty

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of nature, masculine,
feminine high energies.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And we cut that off, then
we're energy starved.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Where can we get energy?

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
From other people by
getting their attention.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
We can be the bad girl,
the good girl, the bad boy,

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the good boy, the rescuer,
the mess, the intimidator,

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
all these roles,
including being positive.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:90%
This is one of these.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that's very
culturally accepted now.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we go around, positive
people will like us.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a desperation
in the eye and in the smile.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The antidote to that is connect
back to your birthright,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to energy in unlimited
quantity directly from source,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.390 align:middle line:84%
from all these beautiful things
like the beauty of nature.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll be
filled to overflowing

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:84%
with positive energy,
good energy, love.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:90%
And you won't have to act.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine after
20 years of acting,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it gets a little tiring
to be in the same sitcom.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:90%
So that would be my suggestion.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't think positive
and act positive.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to
genuinely be in a place

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:84%
where this does look
like that you're

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful being and
a wonderful creation

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
much more than just your
ego and your personality.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I broke it down into six
steps so that you can easily

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:90%
access your own wisdom.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And so here they are.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
being receptive.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:10%
I first have to be open and
receptive with my mindset

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:10%
so that intuition can find me.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm not trying to find it.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
hunt my intuition

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or find the right
answer and hunt it down.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It's got a different cosine wave
than we're normally used to.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we first have
to be open-minded,

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:90%
is how do I receive information?

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not
receptive, I'm going

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to be blocking my ability
to access my subconscious

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and my ability to access
information faster.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:10%
Step two is slowing down.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:10%
Now that I'm
open-minded, I actually

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:10%
have to slow down to track
what my experience is and not

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:10%
be in the day-to-day
busyness of life.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Step three is befriend
my inner critic,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
all the different voices that
are telling us to do something

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or where we doubt ourselves
or we second-guess ourselves.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn, how do I
befriend my inner critic so I

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
can separate the
voice of my critic

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:90%
from the voice of my intuition?

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Because not everything I hear
is necessarily good guidance.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I might have my emotional
reaction about my boss

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm cussing him
or her out in my head

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
situation may be.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the voice
of my intuition is

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
coming from a nonemotionally
reactive place.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So step three once
again is how do

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I befriend my inner
critic instead

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of go along for its ride
and learn that separation.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Step four is tune in to
my body in a deeper way.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
How do I actually listen to
my inner signals and cues?

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
How do I recognize my
intuitive language?

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Like do I know that
when I get a strong no,

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from my gut
and a yes might be more

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:90%
centered in my heart space?

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Or I just notice a
relaxation throughout my body

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
when it's a green
light to move forward,

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a red light looks
like I feel a sense of that I'm

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
constricted somehow
and my breath is short

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.308 align:middle line:84%
or I feel a bit shut
down or I get spacey.

00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind
of things you need

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:84%
to start tracking for yourself
because everybody is different.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:10%
Step five is all about
asking for guidance.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:10%
I have to actually build a
relationship with my wisdom,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:10%
otherwise it won't activate.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So how do I actually
ask for, hey,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is this the right
move for our company?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Is this sale-- is
there anything that

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:84%
needs to happen in this
marketing conversation

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.193 align:middle line:90%
that we're not talking about?

00:31:41.193 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there something else my
customer's really wanting, even

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:90%
though they're not saying it?

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:84%
How do I ask that
question to myself

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:90%
and see what my response is?

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Or is this even the
right job for me anymore?

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And then listen what's
my reaction in my body.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the sixth
step is taking action.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
If we don't take action
on what we're feeling,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
dishonoring our self.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the opposite
of being disempowered.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
We're actually dishonoring
our potency in the world.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:84%
If we don't take
action on what we feel,

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:84%
we're not really
blazing a new trail.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:90%
We're not innovating anything.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:90%
We're not changing the dynamic.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough to
just feel what we feel.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to put it
into motion and be

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:90%
decisive in those moments.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what separates
the future leader

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.564 align:middle line:90%
from the leader of the past.

"Emotional Intelligence," that
book came out 25 years ago.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The business world
hasn't really caught

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:84%
on until maybe the last 8
or 10 years where now it's

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:84%
seen as a no-brainer
that, of course,

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
you want to be able to read
out the needs and wants

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of your team, of your
customer, of the marketplace.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.683 align:middle line:90%
It just makes sense.

00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And the marketing world actually
has known that a long time ago,

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:90%
about 100 years ago.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The original marketers in
New York and what have you

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
were in on the psychology
of how we make decisions.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing now
in the business space

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
is that intuitive
intelligence is still

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:84%
a very nuanced topic that has
not gained acceptance fully.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you talk
to the real innovators,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.740 align:middle line:84%
when you talk to people who
are actually doing real science

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.562 align:middle line:84%
and actually
developing products,

00:33:23.562 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:90%

People who actually are head of
their R&D lab in their country.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually having
to think outside the box

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and come up with a new
solution that's not just

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
on their spreadsheet.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:84%
They get how important it is
to tap into a deeper resource.

This is what Richard Branson

When you have
someone like that who

understands the
value of listening

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to their inner signals
and cues, that's huge.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.487 align:middle line:84%
So what we see in the
business space is, of course,

00:33:57.487 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
people who are skeptics.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
There's going to always
be people who are

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of early adopters.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
They're resistors.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:90%
And they want to see it proven.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
Just because we
can't see something

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's not on
our spectrum of experience.

I was out to dinner
in New York City

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:84%
with a colleague and mentor
of mine, a friend of mine,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.820 align:middle line:84%
who is one of the top brand
agencies in the world.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's very sharp,
New York sharp.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:84%
And so he was looking at me
and my title at the time.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:84%
This is while I was
writing my manuscript.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:84%
I was a little bit more
leaning towards some

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of the supernatural
languaging and a little bit

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of woo-woo languaging
in a business book.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:90%
And he saw that.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
Rick, do you want

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to be talking in front
of a Unitarian Church

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:90%
or in front of the UN?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the kind of impact
you're looking for?

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:90%
And it was an honest question.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I didn't
have to think about it.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, the UN.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:84%
That's where I want to
bring this type of work

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
on a much larger scale
where I'm not marginalizing

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:90%
certain audiences.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually making this
even more approachable

to more people.

That's why this is so
important right now,

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
is how do we bring this
work on a mass level?

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm much more interested
to talk to the UN and larger

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:84%
organizations and
people across cultures

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%

is a human thing.
