00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the left
brain is the part of our mind

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:10%
where you analyze, you
define, have language

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:10%
to describe things, you
make things meaningful,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:10%
you categorize, and then
those things actually--

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:10%
after you've defined
them, they often

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:10%
turn into rules and
belief systems, which

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:10%
get kind of calcified.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So then we identify with
that kind of thinking.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:90%
We need proof.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:90%
We need it to be logical.

to come through and run
you the personality.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:10%
So we're in this huge process
of clearing our clutter--

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:10%
all of our fixations, and
beliefs, and fears, and habits,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:10%

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:10%
thousands of people working

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:10%
with their engines spooled up
on the ramp ready to take off.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:10%
That's how complex
a single cell is.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:10%
We have somewhere between
37 and 137 trillion

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:10%
of those in our bodies.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:10%
And our subconscious
mind, I believe,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:10%
knows everything going on
with every single cell,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:10%
the subconscious mind,
not the conscious mind.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind
knows very little.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:84%
We can't remember, sometimes,
where we parked our car,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
or we forget our anniversary,
or we forget what

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:90%
we had for breakfast yesterday.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
much consciously,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
but the subconscious mind
remembers everything,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
everything we've ever
eaten, every face we've ever

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
seen in a crowd, every
sickness we've ever had,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.305 align:middle line:84%
every intense emotional
experience that we had.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It knows what our
emotional baggage is.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It knows everything about us.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The mind is like the
steering wheel of a car.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:10%
It sets intent and direction.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:10%
But the car goes
nowhere without gas.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And so what's the best gas?

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:90%
We've found unconditional love.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
loving relationship

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
between your ego, and
personality, and you here,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of larger forces
that are also part of us,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and the oneness of
our consciousness.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:10%
>> My sense is that literally
we are waking up, not everyone,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:10%
for sure, but there are
enough people waking up,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:10%
and then growing up
with this remembering,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:10%
and cleaning up to help sort out
our inner traumas and patterns

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:10%
that no longer serve us.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Then we can show up in service
to something that's greater

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
than we are, and
then we can link up,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:90%
and then we can lift up.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The subconscious mind of
every individual knows what is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:90%
really wrong with them.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.743 align:middle line:84%
or phobias, or panic attacks,
or PTSD, or eating disorders,

00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
dealing with infertility,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
or digestive
problems, or asthma,

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were dealing
with some kind of pain

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
or discomfort like
migraine headaches, or neck

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
pain, or knee pain, or
back pain, whatever it was,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
they all had something
in common because I

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
was asking their
subconscious minds, you see,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on here.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was
the subconscious minds

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
of all these people
answering back.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
They were all dealing
with emotional baggage.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
An emotional baggage
was the single biggest

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
underlying common denominator
for all of these people.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I realized I had
a lot to deal with.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:10%
We all do-- difficult things
to unpack, traumas, wounds,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:10%
bad habits, limitations.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So I went to work on
myself, and I just

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
followed the thread of what
I came across that seemed

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:90%
to address that in some way.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> An emotional baggage is
the single biggest underlying

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
common denominator
for all of us.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's there in every disease
process we suffer from.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It's there as an
underlying cause, sometimes

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the only underlying cause.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is the underlying
cause all by itself.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
By tapping into the
subconscious mind

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and asking their own
internal computer

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
system what they
really needed, I

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%
was able to get those answers.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority
of those people,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.897 align:middle line:84%
with just a couple
of exceptions,

00:06:30.897 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
were able to get
well even from things

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
that were supposedly incurable.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What people really need to
hear is cancer is a symptom,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
not a problem.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:10%
The way we've created medicine
and pharmaceutical companies

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:10%
is if you have a symptom,
we try to stop it.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I go, yeah, but the
symptom isn't the problem.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can put any kind of
drug that kill your cancer

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
cells-- chemotherapy,
radiation--

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I killed
the stupid cells.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I go, they were a
symptom of something higher.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
outcome of cancer

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is based on the consciousness
of the individual.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:10%
>> To understand what
emotional baggage is,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:10%
you have to understand that
these bodies of ours are more

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:10%
of an energy field
than anything else.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these bodies
of ours seem so solid,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're very 3D, and
we have weight and so on.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a hard time
wrapping our minds

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:84%
around what quantum physicists
have been telling us

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
for so many years, that our
bodies are made of energy.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're experiencing
an intense emotion, what's

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
really going on a quantum
level in your body

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:84%
is that you're experiencing a
certain vibrational frequency.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion has
its own vibration.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So for example, anger
is a different frequency

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
than sadness, and that's
different from feeling loss,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:90%
and they're all different.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're feeling an
emotion that's powerful enough,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it can
be too powerful.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of that energy becomes
trapped in the body.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So that when that event is
over, when the bully moves away,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
or the divorce is
finalized, or you

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
quit that terrible, abusive
job and you get a better one,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
yet you're carrying
baggage with you.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all about consistent,
stable vibrations versus

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:90%
chaotic.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Often the first step
is to actually find

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:10%
where you're stuck.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:10%
It could be a pain in the
body, tension in the shoulder.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It could be an emotion.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it's all about flow.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
At the frequency level,
it's about coherence.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
At the chime or
music level, it's

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
about flow, flow
with no blockages.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's easy to tell
when your energy is blocked

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:10%
because you're
going to feel bad.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:10%
You're just going to feel
bad, you're going to feel off.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you feel off, you
know there's something amiss.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It could be something internal.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be negative
thoughts and feelings

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that you're having,
emotions taking over.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It could be a physical problem.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
You might have an
illness, or you

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%
might be developing an illness.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of the ways
in which you can be blocked,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's easy to clear
your energy field.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:84%
It's even easy to
clear your energy field

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's going to make
you feel physically better.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
it's a cure or anything,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
but you can feel a lot better
if you use some healing prayers

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:90%
or healing affirmations.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> People need to know their
thoughts are not just things

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
that fly off.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Their thoughts are translated
into chemistry by the brain.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And the chemistry is
released into the blood,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and the blood is
the environment that

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:90%
shapes behavior and genetics.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
According to quantum physics,
the most valid science

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, consciousness
is what is creating our life

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.162 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:10:09.162 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, what if
I have a consciousness

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:90%
of Heaven on Earth?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, then you
manifest heaven on earth.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> If your mind is
dwelling on negativity,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to do what I
call the thought form healing

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:90%
prayer.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
That's really simple.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
All that you do
is to get in touch

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
with the negative feelings that
you're having, and say what

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
they are, and then say the
opposites of what they are.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, I now release all
sadness and pain from my mind

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:90%
now, and it is gone.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I am filled with
thoughts of happiness,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and joy, and freedom from pain.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, God.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:90%
You can do it that simply.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, you're
going to feel lifted.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel positive.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
out of that funk,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be in
a positive state.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:90%
You could use the word "God."

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
You can use the word "spirit."

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what is spirituality?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, definition.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Field-- invisible
moving forces that

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:90%
influence the physical world.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:90%
What's the definition of spirit?

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:10%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:10%
I go, [GASPS] oh my god,
quantum physics and spirituality

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:10%
have the same conclusion.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm in touch with
Spirit with a capital S.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:10%
That means the Holy Spirit, the
Divine Spirit, the God Spirit,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:10%
whatever you like to call it.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been on
many radio shows,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and people call in and say, Doc,
everything in my life has been

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:10%
crap, from birth to now.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And I go, hmm, I'm very
compassionate about that.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But then I go, congratulations,
most people's lives

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.152 align:middle line:90%
are random, some good, some bad.

00:11:54.152 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:90%
You are affecting your reality.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is lower your fear.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then positive
realities could be created,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:90%
instead of all these negatives.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That person is
being very powerful,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
but they're creating fear-based
thing after fear-based thing

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and getting confirmation.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
My personal belief is we're
in a free-choice universe.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's doing it to us.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.448 align:middle line:90%
Karma is not doing it to us.

00:12:18.448 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll say-- I'm going
to make this one up.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a 15-year-old boy.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I look at you in class,
and I begin to like you.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I ask my friends, do
you think she likes me?

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And they go telegraph
your friends.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I get up
the nerve to ask you out.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, would you like
to go to the movies Saturday?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And you stiffen, and
redden, and say, no.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a
conclusion you didn't like me.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a false conclusion.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
You like me a lot.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You asked your dad, this nice
boy would like to take me out.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Can I go?

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, you can't
date for another year.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:90%
You're too young.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing is your
embarrassment, your anger,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But I make a conclusion
in my free choice

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't like me.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So I lick my wounds
for a couple of months.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
So another person gets my eye.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I go up to ask
her, and I have fear.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:90%
So I walk up.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
There's sweat under
my arms in rings.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:90%
My body language is like this.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I have poor timing.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I go up to her when she's
with her cool friends,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and I go, you wouldn't want
to go out with me, would you?

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And she laughs and
says, get lost.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Now I have two episodes of
reality confirming itself,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
and I develop conclusions.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And that conclusion might be
whoever I like won't like me.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I could live my life that way.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.595 align:middle line:84%
The universe isn't doing
it, but my fear is doing it.

00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> A woman came in to see me who
thought she was having a heart

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.913 align:middle line:90%
She was a patient of mine.

00:13:45.913 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't seen her
for a month or so.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:10%
But she came in, and she had
this crushing chest pain.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:10%
She had difficulty breathing.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Her left arm was
completely numb.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The left side of
her face was numb.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that looks like a
heart attack, right?

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And I told my staff, we
might need an ambulance,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but let me just really quickly
do some testing on her,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:90%
and so I did.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Tapped into her
subconscious mind

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and found that there was
emotional baggage that

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:90%
was causing this symptom.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.837 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a chart
of emotions that we use.

00:14:15.837 --> 00:14:17.545 align:middle line:84%
There are about 60
emotions on the chart.

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's divided up into two
columns and six rows.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.655 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very quickly
able to figure out

00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
what the emotion was.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%
The emotion was grief.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her subconscious
mind, when did this occur?

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
This emotion of grief
had become trapped

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:90%
in her body three years before.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived at that,
she broke down weeping.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I can't believe
I'm dealing with that still.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, I thought
that was all over.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what in
the world happened?

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
She said that year, her
husband, she found out,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
had been having an affair, so
she confronted him about it.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
The marriage blew up, and she
ended up getting divorced,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and she spent a year
in therapy dealing

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
with it mentally and had even
recently gotten remarried.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
As far as she was concerned,
that ex was just her ex.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But at the time it
happened, it was shattering.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
She was so deeply in
love with this guy

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and expected to be with him
for her whole life, forever.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So that emotion of
grief, that she felt

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:84%
was so powerful, that
became trapped in her body.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I released that, the
feeling came back into her arm

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and into her face within
about three seconds.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And the chest pain was gone.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty breathing,
it was all gone.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And she left the office
about 10 minutes later

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
after joking with my staff
and was totally fine.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember after she
left, sitting bone at my desk,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and my head was
kind of spinning.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, what in the
world did I just witness?

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that an
emotional energy like that

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:90%
can create these symptoms?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
That was almost 30 years ago.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe that she
would not have survived.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:58.485 align:middle line:90%
We're still in touch.

00:15:58.485 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:90%
She has a horse ranch in Oregon.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
she would have died,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and she would have been somebody
who literally would have died

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.728 align:middle line:84%
of a broken heart,
very likely, and no one

00:16:12.728 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
would have realized
that what really killed

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:90%
her was her husband's affair.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Unwell being, disease,
whatever we want to call it,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:10%
distraction even, anxiety
and depression isn't about

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:10%
the disease coming
from somewhere.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It's much more about who
I am as a potential host

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:90%
for that disease.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if my
immune system is deficient,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
then I become a more of
a host for the potential

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
for a disease.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So then how can I maximize my
immune system is the biggest

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
question that people should be
interested in getting answered.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a reset that
can happen at any moment.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:10%
And it brings us back to the
primordial condition, brings us

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:10%
back to our natural state,
which is ease, peace, love,

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:10%
purity, pure awareness.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is really what I'm
teaching people, is just how

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
to relax into themself, into
this moment, into what is,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and to really
explore what's here.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
world and what's going on,

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
you see that, really,
the trouble in the world

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
is that there's too
many egos running amok,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
doing what egos
do when they don't

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
know the deeper truth of what
we are and what really matters.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Being greedy, grabby,
pushy, self-centered,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
acting as if what they
think, and say, and do

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't affect the whole, and
of course, we know that it does.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And right now, our
world is ego on crack.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's very painful to see
that those in leadership,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
the best that they can
do is be more of a bully,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
be more aggressive,
be more about me

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and my people, me
and my family, and--

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
excuse my French--
[BLEEP] everybody else.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That is deep suffering from a
spiritual perspective, whatever

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%
your politics are.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The more we wake up
spiritually, the more

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
we realize that you are
not separate from me

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:90%
quite literally.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
What's good for me must
mean what's good for us all,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and that compassion,
and empathy,

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and helping one
another where we can,

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
not only makes good
sense for our survival

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
but is required for
any peace or happiness.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in the Western world,
the first rule in medicine is,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:90%
first, do no harm.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And you want that.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You want your doctor to
promise not to do harm.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand, you
have to ask the question, like,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.920 align:middle line:10%
well, what harm are you
promising not to do?

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The first rule in Chinese
medicine is honor the spirit.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about going to
the doctor about your body

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
as much as it's about
going to the doctor

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to come to know yourself
more deeply as a whole being.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor promises, first,
I will honor the spirit.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:10%
So instead of starting with
the body and working up,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the ideal, in
Chinese medicine, is

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:10%
to start with the
top, the spirit,

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:10%
and work down because the
spirit, theoretically,

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:10%
influences the heart
and mind, which

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:10%
has to do with perception, and
perspective, and assumption,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:10%
and personal ideals.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The heart and mind makes
the decision of what to eat.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The heart and mind makes
the decision what to drink

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and how much to drink.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The heart and mind
makes the decision

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:90%
about whether to rest our self.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what
happens in our society

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
is we work from the
body up, and our idea

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is that we're worthless
unless we're doing something.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we wear this one
out, but we had to decide.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people would say,
well, I didn't decide that.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, the decider
is under the influence

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
of social assumptions,
which are not contributing

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
to your well-being.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.245 align:middle line:84%
>> A good analogy for ego
structure is like a hard block

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.045 align:middle line:90%
of ice.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Its fundamental
substance is still water.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental
substance hasn't changed.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
However, it's frozen,
and dense, and opaque.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's how human
beings can get

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
when we get separated
from what we really are,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:84%
which happens to everybody
in the process of developing

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:90%
a personality.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:10%
Our consciousness becomes
dense, hard, opaque

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:10%
to its divine nature.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:10%
We don't feel I am the love.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Peace is here.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel the joy.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Joy feels like we have to get
it by some external means.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
All of the great
spiritual traditions

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:84%
agree that we have to find
a way of breaking down

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:90%
that hard block of ice.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The way intuition tends
to get clouded the most is

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:10%
if we're in our left-brain
head and analytical mind,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and particularly
if we go into fear.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They'd even do
studies where they'd

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
send energy toward
placental DNA, pristine DNA.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
The DNA uncoils, and there's
more information transfer

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
when the people
sending energies are

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
in a positive
motivational place.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
If they send fear-based
emotions-- when I use fear,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I use it broadly,
anything that clouds love.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
That could be anger, cynicism,
bitterness, confusion,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
all of those things.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You send that to the
DNA, the DNA tightens up,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:90%
less information transfer.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I noticed that when I
am being unpleasant with

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:10%
my daughter, doing things that
are creating strife between us,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:10%
it's always, inevitably, there's
something going on in me,

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:10%
in my life, personally,
and probably with my work,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:10%
that I'm scared about.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.015 align:middle line:84%
Or I mean, I could say
that I'm angry about,

00:22:37.015 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
but really, I'm
angry because I'm

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.057 align:middle line:84%
scared that something's
going to happen,

00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and somebody has
taken advantage of me.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole mix of
stuff, but it comes down

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.938 align:middle line:90%
to having some kind of fear.

00:22:44.938 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes, it just feels like
somebody threw a wet blanket

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:10%
on top of you.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.785 align:middle line:10%
So you get heavy, dense, solid.

00:22:50.785 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:10%


00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:10%
It feels like you can't move.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is a fear
response, basically.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's telling
you, in a subtle way,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
this is not right
for me right now.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to notice
those subtle signals,

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:90%
you can stop and then say, why?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Let me look at that a minute.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.487 align:middle line:84%
>> The more that I can take
some time out to sit, OK,

00:23:17.487 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
what is it that happened today
that's making me feel this way?

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I am feeling it even
if I'm not letting it in.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing to do
is to set aside some time

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
and actually experience it.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, if you hear a
lie or if something comes up

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that's either dangerous,
or inappropriate for you,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't fit with you right,
you will get a contraction,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and typically, it's
in solar plexus.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.893 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people find
it in their throat,

00:23:44.893 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
or they feel like
they're having a heart

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
attack, or headache, or
whatever, all through the body.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Even a few seconds of
really actually just letting it

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:10%
happen, for me, usually brings
some insight, like, oh, yeah,

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.442 align:middle line:10%
I feel tense because this person
at work said something to me,

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:10%
and it just comes back to me.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have some insight,
like, oh, yeah, of course,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I feel that way.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm able to connect
it to something that happened.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can realize I'm
scared that something

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen at work
that I'm nervous about,

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.692 align:middle line:84%
but it has nothing to do with
this person I'm with right now.

00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So I can let the feeling go
and get back into the flow,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:90%
with the present moment.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
If I'm triggered by something,
I've got some process going on.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a synchronistic
moment that's

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:84%
helping me get
clear on something

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:90%
that I'm dealing with.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
More I can take it that
way and see the world

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
as helping me resolve
my own challenges,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the more I can find a sense
of peace and equanimity,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and get back into being
excited about life.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Physical life, to me,
is a kind of experiment

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
because in the spiritual
realm, it's all merged.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:10%
You don't know the difference
between you and anything else.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:10%
You share knowledge.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And you can have all
kinds of identities,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:10%
but they're all there
at the same time.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So what would it be like to
have one identity for 80 years

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we have?

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see what it's
like to drop my frequency down

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
so much that I fragment into
objects and empty space.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to try that out where
everything seems separate.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's an experiment.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's for the soul to understand
what individuality is.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%
So we involve and evolve.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
You come down in frequency
into physical reality

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
where things fragment into
time, space, and matter.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to evolve
again, and clear away the fear,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and open up our energy, and
run at a higher frequency,

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and we start to go back up the
spiral to where we came from,

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:90%
our home.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of why we can't turn
more substantially within

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and deepen is because of
some instinctual reflex that

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
can't trust that
it's safe enough.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to address
our issues to do with trust.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to address the reasons
why we are controlling.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:10%
We have to address what
limits your capacity to trust?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:10%
And who does that
mistrust belong to?

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:10%
Is it yours?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:10%
Is it your ancestors?

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it got to do
with something that

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.650 align:middle line:84%
happened in your culture
that made you feel afraid?

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's trauma in the
collective field.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we really look
at why we can't trust,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
why we can't let go
of fear, why we can't

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
let go of strategy
and habit of control,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
inevitably, there's
material there

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be met by
that loving kindness.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I made a choice to be led
by Spirit in everyday life.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:10%
It's a very interesting
way to live.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I ask Spirit with a capital
S, the Divine Spirit,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
what's wisdom for me
in any given situation.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
If I have to make a decision
about which car to buy

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
or which person to hire,
anything that is of import,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I ask Spirit, and
I receive guidance.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And often the
guidance is not just

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
yes or no, I'll be
given wisdom from Spirit

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:90%
by which I live my life.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Once I made that decision and
I started to live like that,

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
my life became an
amazing adventure.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a very empowering
understanding, but it calls us,

00:27:51.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:10%
it invites us to step into
that empowerment and to accept

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:10%
our responsibility joyously as
co-creators of our realities,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, responsibility
for how we are in the world

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and with the world.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the best ways to move
out of fear and into a more

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:10%
heart space, or intuition
is more easily accessed,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:10%
is by generating
feelings of love.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
an example or two.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
First one is of a hunch.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The first time I heard
the word Starbucks many,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, I got
a big glowing feeling

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:90%
in my heart area.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:90%
So I called my broker.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
They had never heard
of the company.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:90%
This is very early.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
They looked it up,
said, oh, Joe, they're

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
going to be doing coffee shops.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't invest in that.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always at least
write it down and track it.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
If I can afford it,
I buy one share.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
If I can afford more,
1,000 shares, whatever.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, my fantasy is I
have a little guide up there.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And if I never listen
to them and acted on it,

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:84%
in about two weeks,
they'd be bored,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
saying all this good
information it's never acted on.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's a spontaneous
thing, a hunch.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:84%
That's more likely to come
to you-- synchronicity,

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:90%
serendipity, hunches--

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
if you are in a
loving, relaxed, open,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
feeling abundant, feeling
generous kind of place

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
than if you are thinking of
all the problems in the world

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and are overloaded with a
lot of left-brain thinking.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we move from
hunch to something

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that's really, really important
that you want to know,

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
should I date this person,
should I take this job,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and you already have your ego
chattering about the answer--

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:84%
the last boy really hurt my
heart, last girl really hurt

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:90%
my heart--

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
how do you move into knowing
intuitively what to do

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:84%
versus just going to paranoia
about being rejected?

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's waking up, it's growing
up because we're now coming

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to a point where the evidence
is causing signs to, literally,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
turn upside down and to come
to stand alongside universal

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and spiritual teachings.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's converging
with them to reveal

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
a cosmology of wholeness, a
cosmology of consciousness,

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
a science of love because
if love is about anything,

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:28.470 align:middle line:84%
it's about remembering
the interconnectedness,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and community, and
wholeness of all that is,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
so this literally is
a science of love.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When authentic surrender,
authentic ego relaxation

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:10%
It feels like "you"
aren't doing anything.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:10%
That's really the point.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:10%
It's a "relaxing"
of the you that

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:10%
thinks it's doing everything
and running the show that's

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:10%
really actually quite diluted.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's a natural yielding.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like a ah, which is why
I use the term ego relaxation.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
ceasing and desisting

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:84%
of the pushing and
the trying and the

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:90%
have to and should and--

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.420 align:middle line:90%
it's just a melting.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Hopelessness comes when you
think you have to be in control

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:90%
to be happy.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:10%
If you can say this
exactly what's happening

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:10%
right now is what
is, if you can--

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.815 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying you can because
you don't have control over it,

00:31:27.815 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:10%
but if you can get to the
place where sometimes you

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.280 align:middle line:10%
can do that, you'll
notice it feels better.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're filled with
life, and vitality, and joy,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.280 align:middle line:90%
you're not in fear.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
yourself all day?

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.620 align:middle line:90%
I am beautiful.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I am loving.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:90%
I have good friends.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Or do you say, god, you're ugly?

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:90%
You're fat.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:84%
You're stupid,
whatever it might be,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:90%
or the world is out to get me.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> When we bring loving
awareness to those forces that

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:84%
make us less than beautiful,
there's a natural letting go.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a yielding that happens.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And we return to the
natural fluidity and freedom

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:90%
that is our nature.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> One antidote is gratitude.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So some people now go
to sleep or wake up

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
thinking of all the
books they've read

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and how grateful they
are to those authors,

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and the next day, all
the pets they've had

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and how beautiful they
were, and then all

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
the flowers in their garden,
all the waterfalls they visited.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So as you move into gratitude,
you move out of fear,

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.360 align:middle line:84%
so gratitude,
appreciation, praise.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not being Pollyanna.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
It's practical
neurophysiologic survival

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
because you want a good
immune system right now.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system thrives
when we're happy, loving, open.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm renowned by my students
for saying, all else fails,

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:90%
wiggle your toes.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Just sense your feet,
rock your pelvis a little.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so if you do
that, what happens

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is you're switching on more
awareness in the lower body,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.820 align:middle line:84%
switching orientation out
of the whirring of the mind

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
into direct somatic experience,
into the felt sense of,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
well, there is true ground.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I might be
feeling this feeling.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It might not be my
favorite feeling.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, my husband
might be behaving

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:90%
like a pain in the ass.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I might want to
throttle my teenage children.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
However, like here
we are, life goes on.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So it helps us to have
that-- to get the perspective

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and just to be here in a
very direct way that gives us

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:84%
more capacity to take a
breath, and come to our heart,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and just be wiser and more
patient with what's going on.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could melt
fear with love,

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:84%
we could make this planet
a paradise, in my opinion.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:90%
