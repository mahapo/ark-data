do simple things

like they would
come closer to me.

I found them very comforting.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%

and my mom came out and said,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%

and change your clothes.

Why would I do that?

I told the ladybugs,
I am not going in.

I'm going to stay here.

And the ladybug said,
you need to go in.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
because someone is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
she was right there.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It was so healing for me because
I was not used to someone

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:90%
talking to me level to level.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%

great, but let's

know that the house was safe.

and Western religion tended

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:10%
to raise most of us was to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:10%
and our own deep validity and
say that they had the wisdom

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:10%
and the answers.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Listen to us.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So we learned in school mainly
by rote and spitting back

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:90%
facts.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
In many churches
I'm aware of, if you

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
began to question, they might
say, that's a sin of pride,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.525 align:middle line:90%
You need to follow this book.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So we were taught often to
distrust our internal sense.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We can also have
trouble when the culture

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:90%
itself has a false persona.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%

but they're not saying anything.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't express
anger in that family.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And the kid comes and says,
Mommy, Daddy, what's wrong?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And they say, nothing.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You learn to distrust because
you love your parents,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to distrust

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:90%
with that first nothing.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
doing you a favor

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from adult
conflicts that you don't

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
need to know about, that there's
financial problems or whatever.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But what you learn is, I
know there's something.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.425 align:middle line:84%
That's my internal truth, and
I've been told there's nothing.

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And we start to distrust that.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%

oh, the best thing for me now

is to get up and run.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And they say, sit down
and recess is in an hour.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And we distrust our
own body's sense

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that we would probably
learn better right now if we

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:90%
were active for five minutes.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We could come back
and concentrate.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But instead, we're
taught, we know best.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And since we are
beings that love

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to be loved and
love to be accepted,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, if we're ostracized
from the tribe we may die--

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, babies have
failure to thrive

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
when they're not touched.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to really pay
attention to those signals.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we in line with
our tribe or not?

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And our tribe for
many years have

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
been teaching many
things that may cause

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:90%
us to distrust our intuition.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The teachers, the educational
authorities need to understand

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:10%
that these children are
predominantly right-brained,

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:10%
so they need to be nurtured
through creativity,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:10%
through every aspect
of creativity.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I understand that they need
the basics of maths and English

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
or whatever language they speak.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
nurtured and they're

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
taught through creativity,
then their right brains

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
become more expanded and
they will function better

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
from that aspect
than the left brain

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because the right brain is the
creative, intuitive, female

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
side where the left brain is the
masculine, logical, analytical

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The more the children are
forced into the left brain,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.715 align:middle line:84%
the quicker the ego
begins to come forward.

00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they go into all the
negative aspects of the ego,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're nurtured then
through fear, doubt, worry,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if every
child on this planet

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
was nurtured through their right
brain, creative and intuitive?

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
There would be
practically no illnesses.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:90%
There would be harmony.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:90%
There would be equilibrium.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And this planet would move
back into the dimensions

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:90%
it needs to be in so quickly.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGING]

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So ICU is Inspiring
Children Universally.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Right, come and have a seat.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We take the children through
10 or 12-week sessions

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
to enable them to connect
with their outer consciousness

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and be able to function
in a different way

00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
where they can see,
write, play, read, draw,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of things without
the use of their physical eyes.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Blindfolds on then.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Good girls.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We blindfold the
children and we get

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:84%
them to see with a whole
different aspect of themselves.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So you've got some copper
wire and you're going

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:90%
to make a headband, all right?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So here are all your beads, so
you can reach into the center,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
hopefully.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We normally see them
after a school day,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
unless they're home-schooled.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So they would come for
an hour after school,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and we'd take them through
what we call the opening

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
process to align them with
their outer consciousness,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and we take them through
the process to see.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So we encourage them to use
the light within them, which

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
effectively is their
outer consciousness,

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
but we're bringing
it from inside out.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is getting a bit easier.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
These children are not
using their third eye.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
When you block out
all light to the eyes,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland,
which is the third eye,

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%
temporarily closes down.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.255 align:middle line:84%
So we're not using the third
eye in any shape or form.

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:14.915 align:middle line:84%
When they align with
their outer energy,

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
if we liken it to their spirit
standing over their shoulder

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and then transmits that
information via the brain,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that's the simplest
form of helping people

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:90%
to understand what is happening.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotten how to do it.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:90%
You're doing well.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Bring it round to the middle.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The brain has to go through
some form of recalibration,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
almost as though the
neuropathways have

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to be realigned because the
eyes aren't functioning,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and yet the child
is doing something

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.895 align:middle line:84%
that the eyes would
normally be partaking in.

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:49.745 align:middle line:84%
When those neuropathways
are formed,

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that is the beginning of
the balance between the left

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.445 align:middle line:90%
and the right brain.

00:10:55.445 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Some children say it's like
looking through a tiny pinhole.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- some
children say it's

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:90%
like looking through a tunnel.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Some children can
see from both sides.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Some children can
see behind them.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is that they
have the potential to see out

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:90%
of any cell in their body.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Freya, that's really clever.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:90%
You all right there, Bella?

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A couple of the basics that
we do throughout the session is

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we never, ever say no to
the children in a session

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
because the minute you say no,
they're going to be triggered

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:90%
by their left brain.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're nice.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Purple one.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:84%
When we're working with
them, we work very fast so

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that their left brain
doesn't have time

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of the process.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we work fast with them,
we get really good results.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Doing an hour session
with a child as a teacher,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you
need to lay down

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
for three hours
afterwards [LAUGHS]

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
because you have
to be on high alert

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
on every level of
your consciousness

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
while you're working with
them because actually,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
when they're working
in that level,

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:90%
they could outwit you easily.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:84%
They have this pure energy
because they're younger.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been conditioned
or programmed in certain ways.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So as a teacher, you have
to have your wits about you.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:90%
You have to be sharp.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to be alert.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to have eyes in
every cell of your body

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
while you're watching them so
that they don't wrap you up

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:90%
in tape.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
choose a book and we're

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
going to pass it
round the table,

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
read a page each.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's choose this one.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, Freya, tell us
the name of the book.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> "Listening With My Heart."

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So open it to the first
part of the story.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> "Today was the class play."

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> "Waiting for mama to
walk with her to school,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
she paced back and forth when
she spotted a heart-shaped

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:90%
rock."

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, Bella, your turn.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> "Esperanza picked it up and
showed it to her mama as soon

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
as she stepped outside.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
'I see you found a little
treasure', said mama."

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good girl.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> "Esperanza rubbed its rough
surface and felt a twinkle

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:90%
of joy. 'Maybe it's a sign.'

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
'For what?' asked mama.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
She thought about the class
play later that afternoon,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
wondering what it would finally
be like in the spotlight.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
'To put my heart into
everything I do,' she answered."

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> "At that moment, they head
scratching and a soft cry."

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> "Esperanza peeked under
the stairs and spotted a kitty

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
shaking and shivering,
no mama in sight.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
She scooped the kitten onto
her lap and cuddled her.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:90%
'She's all alone.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I think she's hungry.'

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Esperanza reached
for her lunch bag,

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
pinched off a piece of
chicken, and offered it

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:90%
to the kitty who gobbled it up."

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Even when they come
for their first session

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and we ask them to
put a blindfold on,

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:90%
they don't ask why.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
If I had an adult
here and I said,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
right, we're going to
put this blindfold on,

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and they look at it and they
see two little white pads

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
inside the blindfold,
they'd want

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
to know what the
white pads are for.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So the children
don't ask questions.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other thing we
never, ever do in a session.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
We never ask them a question
because the minute you

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
have a question mark at
the end of a sentence,

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
they have to answer it
with their left brain.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So we avoid the left
brain at all costs.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying, what
do you see on the page,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
we would say to them, tell
me what you see on the page.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So we command them
with love rather than

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:90%
ask them a question.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you see on
the page as well this time.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> A kitten, a lady with a star.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> "Can we keep
Cleocatra, please?"

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always had a
really strong intuition.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's helped me throughout life.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Esperanza.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good girl.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:10%
>> There was something inside
me that knew that my girls had

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:10%
to do this.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
There was just a
voice inside me.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like, take the
blinkers off, you know?

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Not all is what it seems.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.415 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:15:27.415 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:90%
What harm could it do?

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was stronger than
the skeptical part of me.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And on the other side?

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> A boy--

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> --with a soccer ball.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Some trees.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Bushes.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Bench.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Bin.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a read then.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
"At school, Esperanza was
more focused on the play."

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not about the
seeing with the blindfold.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of like
the icing on the cake.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> "Awaited her cue."

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Pass it on to Evie.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> My twins did it first.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They're now 15.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have another
daughter who's

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:90%
here today doing ICU, Evie.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
She's 10 and she started
about two years ago.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> He says a bush or a tree.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it looks like it.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a tree?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Flowers.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> A girl?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> The star.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me the colors
of the rainbow.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Point to the colors and tell me.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> >> Red.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Orange.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yellow.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Green.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Blue and purple.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's read then.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
"Esperanza walked
on stage, tripped

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
as she was about to
say her first line,

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and splattered
across the stage."

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It can boost their
self-confidence.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very healing,
their self-worth.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they grew so much
when they was doing it,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and they're still growing now.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> "All eyes were glued to her.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.645 align:middle line:90%
She wished-- she wished as--"

00:17:03.645 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> "She wished she--"

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> "She wished she
could just disappear."

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Good girls.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.165 align:middle line:84%
>> My daughter was struck
down with an illness.

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:10%
They told us that she had
ME, which I think is also--

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:10%
they call it chronic
fatigue syndrome as well,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:10%
so it has the two
different names.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
had no cure for her,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and that there was nothing
they could do for her.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.232 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, as a mother, this
motherly instinct was like,

00:17:31.232 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
well, hang on a minute.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
She's 10 years old.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
You can't say this to me.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- this
can't be true.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We went for about a year and
a half to two years with Jess

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
just-- she just got
worse and worse.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Her illness progressed.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.223 align:middle line:84%
And she-- in the end, she was
pretty much wheelchair-bound.

00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't get out of bed.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We used to carry her
backwards and forwards

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to the bathroom, and
just a mother's worst

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
nightmare or any parent's worst
nightmare for their child.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And I used to run
a group at home,

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and this particular day a new
lady came into this group.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And her name was Karen.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.092 align:middle line:84%
And she became good
friends with Jess

00:18:10.092 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
because Jess couldn't
go to school.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
She didn't go to
school for two years.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Karen was the one
who taught ICU.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said one
day out of the blue,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I teach this program called ICU.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
heard of it, which I hadn't.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
She said, I think that
this might help Jess.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And Jess instantly said, yes,
please, I'd love to try it.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was where
the ICU started

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
to be born like in our home.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
At that time, if ever we went
out, she was in a wheelchair.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And within probably
four months, I

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
can remember throwing the
wheelchair in the rubbish.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I never thought
I'd see this day.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So I would say from
the start of the ICU

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
where it felt impossible,
it was just like,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I had to give up all work
and everything I was doing.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:84%
My life became around
just supporting

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Jess through this illness to
six months later, our little one

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:84%
just being full of life
and back to normality,

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:90%
whatever that might be.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It was life-changing,
life-changing for Jess,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
life-changing for our
family, life-changing for me,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
for all of the people around
us because the ICU saved her,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So girls, I'm going
to hold a card up,

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and I'll hold it up for you.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going to do is
draw what you see on the card.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's go.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
If we look at an abused child
and we look at an angry child

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're
out of alignment,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.792 align:middle line:84%
the reactions are
very much the same.

00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> This color's so light.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I need a pink.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:10%
>> The child that has been
forced to contract its energy

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:10%
through possibly abuse or the
child that doesn't feel like it

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:10%
belongs even though it's in a
family-- a very loving family,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:10%
the fundamental things that
are the same is the contracted

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:10%
energy field and the frustration
that builds up inside of them.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
If they can't express the energy
that builds up inside of them,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
then it's like a little
time bomb waiting to go off.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I work with autistic
children, and--

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:90%
oh boy.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:90%
They are so high vibrational.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lamp that can
only take a 30-watt light bulb,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
if you try to put a 120-watt
light bulb into that lamp,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:90%
it's going to blow.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're looking
at these children

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
being a 120-watt light bulb
being fitted into a body that

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:90%
can only take a 30.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So they're hyper.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They express themselves
in certain ways,

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and then they're given
medication to numb them down.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So all of that
energy that they are

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
is building up inside
of them, and then

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
they just need to explode.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
When they become that
frustrated, that angry,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
the energy field gets
closer and closer to them

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
so they can barely breathe.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.277 align:middle line:90%
Nice picture, Evie.

00:21:05.277 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I should have probably
done the yellow first before--

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
You're doing really well.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Once the children start school
and go through the education

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
system, then we're looking at
a numbing of their vibration.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.825 align:middle line:84%
The education system just
doesn't suit them anymore.

00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It's antiquated in every aspect.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.587 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:21:30.587 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Got to color it in, Bella.

>> When Jess was ill, she
didn't go to school at all.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when she recovered, we
put her back into the school.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:10%
And I think she was in
there for about a month,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:10%
and she just did
not fit into this--

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:10%
this almost-- she would come
home and say, my god, Mom.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
The school is like a prison.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Because she's found
this freedom inside.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
She's found the
truth of who she is,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and she knows that that isn't
going to be found there.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The school comes from many
years of conditioning,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're teaching children to
fit into a society that isn't--

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
isn't of its natural state.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching children to
be something that they're not

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Children are open.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:10%
Children live in a
miraculous world.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:10%
But this is a miraculous world,
and we've got to learn in it,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:10%
just like artists
continue to live.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I think a great artist
remains a child in that sense.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't lose that
sense of wonder.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Just to quote Einstein who
said so many wonderful things,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
he said "There are two ways
to live your life, either

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
as if everything is a
miracle or as if nothing is."

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>> What makes us dismiss our own
superpowers is the feeling that

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:10%
they're not real unless they
are validated in the eyes

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:10%
of somebody who represents the
power structure, who will say,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.295 align:middle line:10%
what is the value of that?

00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:10%
Prove that to me.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:10%
Explain it to me.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:10%
We don't realize that by
entering into that dialogue,

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:10%
we've already given
the power away.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We have no way to win
that conversation.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
The correct response
to that conversation

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is the tone in which you're
approaching me makes it

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:90%
impossible for me to develop.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So unless you can approach
me more sensitively,

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:90%
then I can't engage with you.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:90%

fifth session, and Amber,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:84%
the first twin, she started
to see, which was amazing.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely amazing.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:10%
I remember driving
her home, and she

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:10%
was showing me all the
numbers on the doors

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:10%
from the car window.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And it was just
such an excitement.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And in her excitement,
Abby, she began

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to see as well, which
was absolutely amazing.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.165 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine,
identical twins together

00:23:43.165 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
with the blindfolds
on, it was fantastic.

>> It takes forever just to
color in these pointy bits.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> They were seeing
for a couple of days,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and then a skeptic who they
were very close to, she started

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
questioning.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
She shut down one twin.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
She-- the first twin, she
started to question it,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of shut
down her energy.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And when her energy shut
down, the other twin's energy

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:90%
shut down.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they both
didn't see after that.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We had a little
girl that was reading,

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
but her father was
a complete skeptic.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So this particular day,
he brought his daughter

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:90%
for her session.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was with another
one of the ICU teachers.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting
at the table reading,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and her father was sitting
in the chair behind her,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:90%
quite a way back.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think his curiosity must
have got the better of him

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because he started to
walk towards her to see

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
what she was actually doing.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.655 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl said to
the teacher, my vision's gone.

00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So the teacher beckoned
the father to move away,

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and as he moved away her
reading vision came back.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the energy
of a negative person

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
can shut the children
down, and we also

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:84%
know that it has the
potential for them never

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to be aligned with that
level of consciousness again.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%

what a disappointment,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%
but it really wasn't.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:84%
It really wasn't
a disappointment.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:10%
For instance, Amber, she's the
top in her school for history.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.005 align:middle line:10%
She's got a real
talent for history.

00:25:17.005 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And Abby, she loves art.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
She gets lost in her art.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%

today, and this person, like--

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
we see this person
without her even knowing.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Every personality is individual.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It's an art in
itself as a parent

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to know how much you give
and how much you protect.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.092 align:middle line:90%

Evie.

was doing this, wow, Evie.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
feel doing this?

00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Mommy,
any child can do this.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Any child can do it.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like riding a bike to them.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Evie.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Where'd it go?

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it go?

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The truth is that we
are all consciousness.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not just half of us were
that and half of us were not.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Like, every single one is.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So if it's cultivated
in the right way,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.465 align:middle line:84%
we have a planet
of awakened beings.

00:30:01.465 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Honor them, understand
them, listen to them,

00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:90%
and be at one with them.
