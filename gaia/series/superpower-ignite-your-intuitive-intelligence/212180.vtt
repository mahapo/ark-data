I think what comes closest
to playing the theremin is

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:10%
singing, because it's just
your body, but singing

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.085 align:middle line:10%

CAROLYN EYCK: I took singing
lessons when I was young.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
some years ago,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
the human voice

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is very close to the
sound of the theremin.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:10%
And when I would just sing
for myself, doodling around,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:10%
my friends would say,
well, you sound just

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:10%
like a theremin when you sing.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I was like, well,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
how about combining
these two sounds,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe creating something new.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You hear this electronic sound,
something not quite human,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
but then at the same
time, the voice has also

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:84%
changed into something
more electronic,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
so I started to experiment
with these two sounds

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.976 align:middle line:90%

He would be on the piano, and
I'd be playing the theremin.

I did my bachelor's

after an injury,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%

The theremin is a very early

1920, by the Russian physicist

an instrument, where

I got when I was

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:10%
and the other one
is the instrument

I learned on when I was a kid.

we can change between
different sounds.

heard this sound,

hear a very low note,

which is called zero beat.

And then, there's just nothing.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to do
is adjust the field

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
so that I have the lowest note,
the zero beat, just in my body.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'll use the knob on the
instrument, called pitch,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:90%
and adjust it and check again.

So it's producing the sound.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other side, I could

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
imagine that I have one
invisible string, which

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is attached to the antenna and
it goes straight to my body.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And all my notes are on
that invisible string.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
They are also here,
here, and here.

But in order to get
precise pitches,

I need to limit myself.

And that's, of course,
because of the internet,

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
because we can produce
videos and educate people.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So I always noticed that
when I go through security

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.192 align:middle line:84%
at the airport, because
then people are, yeah,

00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that from
"Big Bang Theory."

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's right.

Practicing the theremin and
playing the theremin, for me,

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is one tool to learn about
thought process and my body.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
In a way, the theremin is
not just a mirror but also

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:90%
a magnifying glass.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to being
more honest and more true

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, so we can
learn about ourselves.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we can feel ourselves,
we can feel empathy with others

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and that will solve
a lot of problems.
