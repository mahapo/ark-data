>> I'll give a quote
from Albert Einstein.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:84%
"Reality is an illusion,
albeit a persistent one."

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Western world,
we're addicted to buying drugs

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:90%
instead of making medicine.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also important to
understand the biofield

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of being human, and how we
can also use energy to treat

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%
disease.

without use of pharmaceutical

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:90%

>> There's potential
here that's dramatic,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to not only just
get you healthy,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:84%
but to get you tapped into that
higher information where all

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:90%
intuition is.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The biofield is a popular
term used to describe

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
the energies that are
emitted by the body.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
The energies that
make up the biofield

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:10%
are the individual energies
associated with each organ,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:10%
with each system like
the nervous system,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and with each molecule
for that matter

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:10%
because every molecule has
an energy field it emits.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a magnetic field
also coming from the body.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:10%
And most of that
is from the heart.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And the heart, by the way,
makes the strongest fields

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:10%
that we can measure
from the human body.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:90%
We have electricity.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It's flowing in
our nervous system,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
flowing in our acupuncture
meridians, which

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
are invisible channels deep
inside the body along which

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:90%
chi is flowing.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Chi is this resource that is
diffused throughout the cosmos.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:10%
And a cosmos is more
than a universe.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
This energy field is
what qigong is all about.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And the gong is very
interesting because it's

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
a super simple word.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It just means work.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
The work is always defined
by what the work is.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So in Chinese
medicine, the idea is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to work with the
aspect of yourself that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
is infused throughout your being
at every level that is also

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
present in the entire universe.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
That's probably about as
cool as the work can get.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:10%
>> We have this
gross physical body,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:10%
and we also have a subtle body.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And the subtle body is
often called the auric field

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:10%
or the energy field.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
layers to this subtle body.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The physical body the life force
energy body, the mental body,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the intellect body,
and the causal body.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's called five sheaths
or pancha kosha in Sanskrit.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
All these layers pervade
and permeate the body.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But some of them go out
further surrounding the body.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go from
the one that's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
closest, which is the pranamaya
kosha, which is the life energy

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
That is the subtle body through
which chi or qi or prana flows.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there
are the chakras,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
the seven energy
centers up the mid body,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
including over the head, the
third eye, the throat chakra,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the heart chakra, and below
middle of the abdomen,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and the lower chakras.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Each source has a different
type of energy that it emits.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
cells emit sound,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
light, and
electromagnetic energy,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and yet another kind of
energy, which is popularly

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
called scalar energy.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That's like
electromagnetic energy.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's a little more subtle.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet another kind of energy,
which is called quantum energy.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Quantum energy goes
backwards in time.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It travels faster than
the speed of light.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And has all these
exotic properties.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So the biofield is
actually a conglomeration,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
all of those different
kinds of energies.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm one of the few people,
and there are a few others,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:10%
trying to map the energy
fields of being human.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:10%
And I do believe that our
energy field is probably

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:10%
the most complex energy field
in the universe that we know of.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So then the question
is, how does it work?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese will
tell you just simply

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
it works because it
helps to arrange the chi.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But scientists will say, well,
we don't even know what chi is.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And then assume that
because they don't know what

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.405 align:middle line:90%
chi is, that it doesn't exist.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.726 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The only reason you can see
me is because the lights are

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:90%
The reason is this.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:10%
My body is an energy field.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:10%
It's not physical.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:10%
But photons of light
coming from a light source

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:10%
hit my energy field, and
the energy of the photon

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:10%
is deflected by the energy of
the body and deflected back.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing
me, you're seeing

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
a veneer of photons that are
hitting the surface of me

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and bouncing back.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So you see a
reflection of light.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But you do not see my
body, because it's not

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:90%
made out of matter.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:84%
There is no physical
element to the universe

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
because everything you perceive
as matter made out of atoms,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and atoms are built
out of energy,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
not matter, then you're looking
at an expression of energy.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
These are what the
scan technologies--

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
MRI, CAT scans, all
these kinds of scans,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90%
they don't read light.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
They can see your structure
by looking through your body.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, then how can
they see my structure?

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
measure light.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It measures
electromagnetic fields.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The CAT scans weren't
created by medical people.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:90%
They were created by physicists.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I say so where's the
medical people come in?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
They go, with this
scanning device,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I can get a map of the body.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take a breast
scan with an energy device,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
you can see a tumor,
because tumor cells

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
have a different energy
than normal cells.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm reading
an energy field,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:84%
the tumor cells will stand
out as a different expression

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:90%
than the normal cells.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
When a conventional
physician looks at the scan,

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
breast scan says
there's a tumor.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Their interest is
give me a scalpel,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly where
to find that damn tumor

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:90%
and I'll cut it out.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.227 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
we've been used to.

00:07:04.227 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what does
quantum physics say?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
If I put in a different
energy, I can change the shape.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.328 align:middle line:84%
Hands-on healing is putting
energy into a system.

00:07:15.328 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And I go, so what does it mean?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I say I can adjust your
health with energy.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Colleagues of mine in
China just did an interesting

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:10%
experiment studying how
traditional Chinese medicine

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:10%
works and studying
the nature of chi,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:10%
where they took words
written on paper,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:10%
and then they were put
in an opaque envelope.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:10%
And then they were put
under a Petri dish of cells.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And they had two sets of words--

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:90%
bad words and good words.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Good words about love and
compassion and bad words

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:90%
about hate and anger and fear.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And the cells, remember,
don't have a brain.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't really have senses
of touch or sound or smell.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They measure different
biochemical parameters.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.445 align:middle line:84%
Different enzymes, different
biochemical markers.

00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they
measured, for example,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
was ATP, which is the chemical
that makes energy in the body.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And they responded.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, depending
on what they measured,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
they responded accordingly.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Conventional science would
say that chemistry affects

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:10%
the body because the body is
physical and energy doesn't.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:10%
That's why we
ignore consciousness

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:10%
and all that stuff.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a study in
London saying, well,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the body does respond
to physical drugs,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
but it also apparently
responds to energy.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Water has an amazing ability
to remember things it gets

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
exposed to.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Things is a technical
word for information,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
which is a technical word for
pretty much any kind of word

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
or sound or image that you could
expose water to it remembers.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now your body has a lot
of processes that you're not

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
conscious of.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But water can convey
information that

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.505 align:middle line:84%
can jumpstart changes in
your body and be therapeutic.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When you treat
water with information,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
you can measure a difference
in the physical properties

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not going to
be there consciously.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to experience it

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
as a change of thought
or anything like that.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:10%
>> But scientifically,
we're gaining more and more

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:10%
of an understanding about
how it works, why it works,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:10%
and how to optimize the effects.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I've seen the water change
in experiments with measuring

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:10%
the energy content of the water.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:10%
I can't decode the
information in the water

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:10%
directly with my
scientific equipment.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:10%
But I can measure,
for example, how much

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:10%
light the water contains.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:10%
>> This technology
is kind of new,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:10%
but they've now figured out
how to transfer the essence

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:10%
of drugs into water.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
When you drink the
water, it turns out

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
the body is able to read
the information in the water

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and respond.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, drugs have side effects.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Drugs are toxic.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Drugs are obnoxious.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:84%
If we work with the
information of the drugs,

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe we won't have
all those side effects.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:10%
>> If I'm sending a signal,
and it could be a drug,

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:10%
a physical chemical
appearing signal,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:10%
or it could be just a
vibrational energy field,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:10%
is there a difference
in the effectiveness?

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And the answer turns out
the energy signal is 100%--

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, 99, 99% more efficient
in sending a signal than

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:90%
is a drug.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.905 align:middle line:90%
Why would I take the damn drug?

00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Ernst Chladni was a German
musician and physicist.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And around 1,800, he devised
this very simple experiment

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:10%
to make sound visible.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:10%
It's a brass plate that he
played with a violin bow.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We're simply going to sprinkle
some sand on the plate.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So watch what
happens when I play

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the plate
with the violin bow.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
You see a beautiful pattern
emerges on the plate.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And if I now play the
plate at a different place,

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.495 align:middle line:84%
then a different
pattern will emerge.

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
You see all the
little sand grains

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
are jumping, moving into
place, into position

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:90%
by an unseen force.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that force
is the power of sound.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So if I sprinkle
on some more sand

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and then excite the
plate again, you

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
see we go back to that
first pattern again.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the
science of cymatics,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
which is the science
of sound made visible.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The opening words of Saint
John's Gospel in the beginning

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
was the word, and the
word was God and so on.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only Saint John's
Gospel, the Christian Gospel,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
but also many other religious
texts around the world.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic texts, for example,
talk in very similar terms.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Even going back
to ancient Egypt,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:84%
the god Ptah talked
about sound being

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:90%
the creator of the universe.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the mainstream
models of cosmology,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
how the universe began,
was because of sound.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So sound in the early universe
was the most potent force

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
in the first few
hundred thousand years

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I have been involved in sound
as it affects us since a child.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:10%
When I attended a Gothic
style architecture church

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:10%
with my family, having
that sound bounce off

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:10%
of those walls the
resonance structure,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I felt that I myself
just listening

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.315 align:middle line:10%
to that could take flight.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
When I went to India, I
experienced a totally different

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
type of resonant
architecture, which

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:90%
is stated in the Vedic texts.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Placing the pillars, the
columns in specific ways,

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the carvings also
reflect frozen sound.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
When the priests were chanting
in a specific Sanskrit meter,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I felt a similar vibration that
just all under my skin, all up

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and down my spine
that things, cells,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
some type of energetic
form was oscillating

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:90%
throughout my whole body.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Many people have attended
some type of musical event

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
where they just feel
the sound so intensely.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
They're oscillating, dancing.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:90%
They are so happy.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So it was through all
of those components

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
together that I
began my trajectory

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
that I am on now with the
developing therapeutic sound

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
devices for people to help
them with their health.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:10%
>> What we're learning and what
science is actually giving us

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:10%
is information about
how this works.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say, for example,
you hear a sound, a tone.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it goes
into the cochlear of the ear.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:10%
>> The ear is connected to
the vagus nerve directly.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:10%
So it bypasses the brain.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:10%
The eardrum is connected
to the vagus nerve,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:10%
which goes to every organ,
except the spleen directly.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So we are built to synchronize
to every vibration around us.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody is telling
us, you need to calm down,

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:84%
learn meditation, spend
some time in nature,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:90%
be kind and gentle to yourself.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.528 align:middle line:90%
You need to reset.

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what people
have been doing for thousands

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:10%
of years going to these
temples where you have

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:10%
these mathematical
formulated designs that

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:10%
harness sound and vibration.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:10%
So when you stand
under those archways,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:10%
those buttresses, you
feel a sonic realignment.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So the body is like this
symphonic orchestra.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.077 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
we get out of tune

00:15:29.077 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
because of all the things that
we're dealing with in our world

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:10%
>> There's an idea that you
have to take a certain drug

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:10%
for a certain problem.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's all
associated with the idea

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:10%
that you differentiate
problems, and that there

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:10%
isn't one underlying functional
solution, shall we say?

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
The one medicine,
basically, is the capacity

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:90%
to organize the chi.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So how do you cure any
disorder in Chinese medicine?

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Organize and nourish the chi.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the one cure.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So in more modern
terms, the one disease

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is the lack of
efficient function.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Lack of efficient
function in the liver,

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
lack of efficient
function in the spleen,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
lack of efficient
function in the heart.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's all dysfunction.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's all one
thing, even though it's

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In the Western world,
you want the neurologist,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
you go down that way,
cardiologist will over there,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
orthopedic doctor,
gastroenterology, they're

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:90%
all in different places.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And it really
reflects on the fact

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we actually have a belief
that these things aren't

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
working together, that they
somehow work in isolation.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And it would be kind
of like saying, well,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
my car's got a carburetor.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
If the carburetor
stops working, I'm

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%
going to put a new one in there.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And we use that kind of
machine idea for humans a lot.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But humans are not a
machine, because the pathways

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
for communication
for functionality

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
are even now not
fully understood.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Sound is literally the
passing on of vibrations from

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
one atom to another or from
one molecule to another.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
And we can hear that sound,
we say that it is sound.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But we also use
the term vibration.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is vibration?

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's actually exactly the
same thing as sound, accepting

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:10%
that we can't hear it.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
we say that when

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:10%
it's below the range of
audibility, which is actually

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:10%
below 16 Hertz, then we use
this term vibration, which

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:10%
just basically means that
we as humans can't hear it.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
As far as the term
frequency is concerned,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
this is because
sound and vibration

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
are periodic phenomena.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to know how many periods
in a given period of time.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So we say that a sound will be
say 80 cycles per second or 80

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Hertz, which is the term that's
now used to measure frequency.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
we're saying is

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that something's vibrating
at a particular rate--

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
80 Hertz, 100 Hertz,
or 1,000 Hertz.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
These are simply
how many vibrations

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
in a given period of time,
usually measured per second.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So this time again,
we have a metal plate.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But now it's driven
by a modal exciter,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
which is this item underneath.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And the modal exciter is
driven by an amplifier.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And then feeding
into the amplifier,

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
we have this electronic
oscillator here.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So it means now we can inject
any frequency that we wish to

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
into the plate and create a
huge range of cymatic patterns.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So again, let me sprinkle
some sand onto the plate.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And we'll begin with a
very low frequency, which

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.185 align:middle line:84%
is actually about 20 Hertz, and
then we'll increase from there.

00:18:57.185 --> 00:19:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So you see at a low
frequency of 20 Hertz,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
we get this rather
attractive but quite simple

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:90%
pattern forming on the plate.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But I gradually start
increasing the frequency now.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Cymatics is a word that
was coined by Dr. Hans Jenny.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jenny was the first person
to apply modern technology

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:10%
to generate these
geometric figures that

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:10%
appeared while applying
different frequencies.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.955 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jenny said, sound
is the organizing force.

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Very distinctive change
occurring at that particular

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Cymatics is the science
of what sound therapy does

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:10%
One note vibrating from
the bottom of a speaker

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:38.002 align:middle line:10%
into a plate of sand
creates a pattern.

00:20:38.002 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I find geometry
very fascinating.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:10%
As a biologist, my first
interest in all that

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:10%
was the shape of molecules
because their shape

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:10%
determines their function.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It turns out geometric
patterns can store energy.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm all about.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So in my quest to always
find a source of energy that

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
had no electromagnetic
component, no physicality

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to it, I came across
geometric patterns.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, this is cool.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Different shapes store
different kind of energies.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I can take a test tube
DNA and put it right

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:90%
on top of a geometric pattern.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if anybody
ever did that before.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:90%
But I did it.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, some
patterns resonate

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in energy, which
the DNA recognized,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
resonated with,
and responded to.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Just the intrinsic energy
from the geometric pattern

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is a bit like the
energy from a magnet.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
You look at a magnet,
it radiates energy.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it continuously
radiates energy.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it dies down,
it's permanently magnetized.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, geometric patterns, as
long as the shape is there,

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.075 align:middle line:84%
the energy is there, and
they will continue to emit.

00:21:56.075 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a beautiful
pattern forming there now.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And the higher in frequency,
the more complex the pattern

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
becomes.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I will just lower
the sound there now,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
so that I can talk a
little more easily.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, these
beautiful delicate patterns

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:90%
are not just pretty patterns.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Everything around us is
built up layer upon layer,

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:10%
frequency upon frequency in
a sort of delicate tracery.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:10%
And what we're seeing
here in these patterns

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:10%
is a kind of 2D simplified
slice through those frequencies.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The limiting factor, of course,
was simply that it was 2D.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no depth to it, and
there's not much resolution

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a crude way
of making sound visible.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I needed something with far
more detail, far more control.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I went on to develop
the cymascope with pure water.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me introduce to you
the cymascope instrument.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The water is contained in
a fused quartz cuvette.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the cuvette itself is driven
by a voice coil motor, which

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:84%
literally injects
the sound frequencies

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:90%
direct into the water.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we'd begin
with 20.8 Hertz, which

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
is one of the dominant human
cavity resonance frequencies.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring up the
sound energy very slowly.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see to begin
with, just a simple set

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of concentric circles.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But as I bring up
the energy even more,

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:84%
we reach a critical point
called the Faraday instability

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
point, at which point
the energy reflects

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
from the boundary of the cuvette
and forms the cymatic pattern.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And there you see it.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
At this particular
frequency, it's

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:90%
actually a five-fold pattern.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the center
there, you can see

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful five-fold
polygon rotating.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that many
people, when they first

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
see these beautiful
images created

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in water by pure frequencies,
think that they're somehow

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:90%
digitally created.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
We live in the computer age.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to show you now

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.525 align:middle line:84%
by putting my finger in
the water what happens.

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
By disturbing the pattern,
you see the pattern

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:90%
disappears entirely.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I take my finger
out of the water,

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and you see the pattern returns.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:10%
>> When I saw that the first
time, I said, Oh, my goodness,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:10%
these look like some of
the shapes I would see

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:10%
in the churches and the temples.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Those were actually frozen
sound carved into those pillars.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that vibratory
field is printed

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
focused at everyone who
walks down this aisle.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:10%
All of these vibrational
signatures carved in this stone

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:10%
or carved in metal are
impacting the energetic field.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I would imagine our
forefathers had discovered that

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:10%
these particular shapes are so
fundamental and universal that

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:10%
they're present
throughout the universe.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
What makes them sacred is
because they are in some way

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
a link to the divine.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Think about mandalas.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans been using
mandalas to look at and help

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:10%
raise their consciousness
to higher levels

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:10%
just by looking at the shape
of the geometric pattern

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:10%
or by feeling the
energy that's radiating

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:10%
from the geometric pattern.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
That's an example of a
sacred geometric pattern

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:90%
if it allows you to do that.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It was Pythagoras who
said that music could be used

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in place of medicine and
contribute greatly to health.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that although
there was a lot happening

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
in the world in terms of sound
therapy and music medicine

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and so on that most of the
research that was happening

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
was not being conducted
at the cellular level.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested
to know, what

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is actually happening
at the cellular level

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
when we subject cells
to specific sound?

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:10%
And I collaborated with
Professor Sungchul Ji

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:10%
of Rutgers University
in the USA.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very simple
protocol that we designed.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Decant a test tube
of human blood--

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
this is whole human blood,
into two smaller test tubes.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
One test tube was put into
our Faraday cage, a room

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
within the lab that's
extraordinarily quiet.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It's quieter than the
quietest bedroom, basically.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
25 DBA for those who are
interested in the sound level.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's left in there in an
incubator at body temperature

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:90%
for 20 minutes.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the other vial is
placed in another incubator.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:84%
This time in the main
body of the laboratory.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And in this incubator,
there's a small loudspeaker.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So we can literally
play any type of music

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
or any type of
sound to the blood.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was Professor
G. who suggested that--

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
it was a 20-minute
period that was

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
needed to have a biological
effect on the blood.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:84%
We experimented with a
wide range of music genres.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Every type of music you
can imagine, basically.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And we also experimented
with white noise,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
which is just kind
of the noise that you

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:84%
would hear from a waterfall
or from ocean breakers,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:84%
What we found was
really surprising.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's always been known
that white noise is

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
healing, walking by the seashore
or standing by a waterfall.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also tried white
noise at 105 DBA, which

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
is a very painful sound level.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You just don't want to be around
when 105 decibels is happening.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
in that case was

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that it literally killed
all of the red blood cells

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in that test tube.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Within 20 minutes,
they were all dead.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
However, every type of music
that we experimented with

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:90%
created a fabulous result.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
The red blood cells
that were counted

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in the musical
environment were always

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
many times more than they
were in the quiet environment.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We were puzzled
by this initially.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were happy to
see this amazing result.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Why should there
be more red blood

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:84%
cells living in the
musical environment

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
than in the quiet environment?

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we've switched to the
medium frequency cymascope,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
which is suitable for imaging
a wide range of types of sound,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
including the human voice.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now going to attempt to
capture my voice frequencies

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
with the cymascope instrument.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You saw some very interesting
and very beautiful

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
imagery from my voice,
because all human voices

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:84%
have harmonic beauty,
contain harmonic beauty.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So now for the first time
ever, as far as I know,

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
heavy truck sound made visible
with cymascope instrument.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that it's actually--

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:84%
well it's not only
distorted, but it's also

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:90%
trying to eject the water.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
We've got little splashes
of water coming out.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you see there is a
kind of jumble of frequencies

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
all trying to imprint
themselves on the water.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But because they're not
harmonically related

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to each other, they're all
fighting with each other

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and vying for supremacy
you could say.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
When we listen to music, for
example, all sounds in music

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:90%
are harmonic sounds.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It simply means that every
frequency within the music

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is related mathematically
to every other frequency.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, these are
multiples or submultiples

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:90%
of a particular frequency.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
All mathematically,
beautifully related.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But dissonant sounds are a
completely different story.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And dissonant sounds,
you might have

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:84%
a large array of
frequencies of sound,

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but they're not mathematically
related to each other.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And so how we perceive those
literally with our hearing

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.835 align:middle line:90%
is they sound ugly.

00:30:54.835 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't sound pleasant at
all because our physiology

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is basically not liking
those dissonant sounds.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, from a
healing perspective,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:90%
that is so important.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
It's so important that
we immerse ourselves

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.245 align:middle line:84%
in harmonic sounds, not
in dissonant sounds.

00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Sounds of a particular
amplitude are generally

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:90%
healing to us actually.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:10%
But sounds, if we are subjected
to too high a sound level,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:10%
can be harmful.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is true of
nature in general, isn't it?

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.630 align:middle line:84%
In terms of radiation
from the sun, for example.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
If we lie in the sun
for a few minutes,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
even at the height of the day,
it can be quite healing for us.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But if we lie in the sun too
long, we end up being burned.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's the same
thing right across nature.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all a matter of dose.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.390 align:middle line:84%
How much of this sound
are we actually being

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:84%
immersed in or
how much radiation

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.345 align:middle line:90%
are we being immersed in?

00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Nothing better for
the root chakra.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Sound therapy and
music medicine,

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
which is another label
that's been given to the way

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that sound can heal, is
becoming a very popular subject

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:10%
All over the world, people are
now studying how sound heals.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.760 align:middle line:10%
So we actually do a full
range of treatments.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We teach sound healing
and audio recording.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So we also have the
recording studio as well.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The large Tibetan Bowl has
a very strong vibration.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And you get the energy
of the metal in you,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:84%
which is really good for
breaking up stuck energy.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So let me know if
it's uncomfortable.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty heavy.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.965 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what this feels like?

00:32:41.965 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:10%
In physics, everything has
its own resonant frequency

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:10%
that it likes to vibrate
at, whether it's carpet

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:10%
or bowl or tree
or everything has

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:10%
its own natural
resonant frequency.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
A strong resonant vibration
will overcome a weaker vibration

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and entrain the weaker
into the stronger.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's called entrainment.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:90%
How was that?

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it took me
by surprise at first,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and then I started to relax.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me try the smaller one.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start
working with a tone,

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:90%
it's a same alignment process.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, for example,
a delta tone or you've

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.730 align:middle line:84%
got a bowl, and
when you do that,

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
you actually start to
vibrate to the sound.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.975 align:middle line:84%
Now vibration changes
the molecular structure

00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:42.775 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:33:42.775 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't even do it on
different parts of the body

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that have different
issues on them.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the vibration
going to areas--

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
like does it find
areas or what is it?

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it will find whatever
areas resonate at that

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Sound is an alignment.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.250 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to know
what's wrong with you.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's part of becoming whole.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
And in our bodies, our bodies
are craving to become whole.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:90%
Where does sound travel?

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go in the body?

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It goes everywhere.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But just like an aspirin,
it just knows where to go.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is brainwave entrainment
with flashing lights.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So the rhythm is
coming from the lights.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:90%
She's getting sound as well.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And it trains you into the
different brainwave states

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:90%
of delta, theta, alpha, or beta.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.449 align:middle line:90%
It's really good for depression.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite activating.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's an exciting time
that we're marrying ancient

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:10%
and today's technologies
to really help ourselves

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:10%
to fortify our fields.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the base pod.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is putting
frequencies that are really

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:84%
well researched through it
for muscles, nerves, tendons,

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:84%
ligaments, endocrine glands,
circulatory, respiratory,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:90%
the brain, full range of issues.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We also have the belt. Very
similar to the base pod,

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:90%
but it's got three transducers.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing is you
don't have to hold it.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:90%
You can just strap it on.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Six months ago, I got a
massage that was too intense

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't walk.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It was too much.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And within 15 minutes
of using this,

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:84%
it was completely
back to normal.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So here we've got the
amethyst spiral mat on top.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So the subwoofers or
transducers on the bottom

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
transmit sound through the
crystals into the body,

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:84%
triggering the crystals
electromagnetic field.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It's very cool.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We've done eight international
sound healing conferences.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
We've added on the
therapy center.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
In our degree program,
we've had our students

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:84%
creating treatment plans for
all these different issues

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:90%
for the last 10 years.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We have Kaiser Hospital
referring patients to us

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%
for pain management.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
We have a treatment where
we can get rid of ADD

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.760 align:middle line:90%
using different rhythms.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
We're also working with
200 autistic adults

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:90%
here in San Francisco Bay Area.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And we're also working
with a dementia ward.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We've come up with treatments
for different stages

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:90%
of dementia.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We are a big bag of water.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So how can we get
the sound pushed

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:90%
into this big bag of water?

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Sound radiates the whole plate.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It is sending an energetic
form wrapping the whole body

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:44.940 align:middle line:84%
energetically in the exterior,
as well as having an impact

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:90%
at the cellular level.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
This is showing a woman who
went for her regular thermogram

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:90%
looking at the oral cavity.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You see here, this
area is white hot.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming down where she
has the inflammatory process

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:90%
pooling.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
She has no symptomology,
but something is definitely

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:90%
happening there.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.630 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes later after a
session on the AMI 750,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:84%
we see that it's freeing up
this pathway along this lymph

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:18.880 align:middle line:90%
channel.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks after the AMI 750
being used on a regular basis,

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:90%
you see that's all calmed down.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:84%
When people are released from
their physical and emotional

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:84%
pain, they become
vibrant beings.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:10%
This mechanic, he had had
surgery two years prior.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And he still had
pain in his legs.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Here with polyinterference
contrast photography,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:84%
you can see the inflammation
and the pain in his legs.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And after a session,
it's reduced.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
That guy that
weekend, we found out

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:84%
felt so good that he went
out and ran a race that he

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:90%
hadn't even been training for.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's think about what
happens in our bodies when

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:10%
sound enters into the visceral
fluids of our bodies that these

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:10%
are the fluids that surround
all the organs in our bodies.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And also what
happens to our cells.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The cells have a
membrane around them.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
science of cymatics

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
concerns making sound
visible on a membrane.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you have sound
and you have a membrane,

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
a cymatic pattern.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:90%
These are the laws of physics.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether we're
talking here about sounds being

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:84%
manifest on the surface
membrane of microscopic cells,

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
sound at a macroscopic
level such as sound

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:90%
on a cloudy plate.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Or if you look onto the north
pole of the planet Saturn,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:84%
you will see a giant
cymatic pattern.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's so large that it
could swallow three Earths.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful hexagon, actually.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So scale doesn't seem to matter
to the science of cymatics.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the realization
that you can do it yourself,

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.530 align:middle line:10%
that we have the
power to do that.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
understand that.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had people who start
dreaming after we do toning.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll have these
certain kinds of dreams.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's making up for all the
years you didn't dream.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.920 align:middle line:90%
It's giving you more intuition.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have all of these
things that we need to do

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to expand our biology and our
medicine and our understanding

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:90%
of the biosphere.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
We're learning what frequencies
do what to the body.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The idea of using
frequencies to treat people

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and to affect our health
and our well-being,

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
it's not so esoteric.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit more
accepted by mainstream.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's exciting about
it is that we're still

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.815 align:middle line:90%
at the learning stage.

00:39:56.815 --> 00:40:01.494 align:middle line:90%
