traveled in Egypt many times.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
But on this particular
occasion, early in 1996,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:10%
we found ourselves in the King's
Chamber of the Great Pyramid

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:10%
all alone, which was a
very unusual occurrence.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Prior to this, we'd
always been surrounded

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:10%
by so many other people.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, for those of
you who've actually

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:10%
experienced the
King's Chamber, you'll

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:10%
know that it has an
extraordinary acoustic quality.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
This sarcophagus is a
block of granite 3.7 tons

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that's been hollowed out.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be the
interment for King Khufu

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:90%
or Cheops.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Many people disagree
with that concept.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, if you strike
the side of it with your fist,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
it rings like a
low-pitched bell.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, as an acoustics
engineer at that time,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated by the
sounds that sarcophagus made.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'd always wanted to lie in
the sarcophagus and make sound.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And never until this
time in early '96

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:90%
did I have the opportunity.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I did lie
in the sarcophagus

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and I made a vocal glissando.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And at one particular
frequency, every cell in my body

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
seemed to tingle.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And a wave of acoustic energy
washed up and down my body,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and goosebumps broke
out all over my flesh.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And it really got my
attention and I thought, wow,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
having at that point in my
career spent almost 30 years

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
studying sound in various
acoustics environments,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd never come across
anything quite like this.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we got back to
the UK, I made enquiries

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
with the Egyptian authorities.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It was not easy.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But several months
later, I returned

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt armed with lots of
acoustics instrumentation.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
About three weeks before
going out to Egypt in '97,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I severely injured
my lower back.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, my goodness,
the pain was very severe.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was so severe
that I actually

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
thought I was going to have
to cancel the whole mission.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But I paid a lot of money
to the Egyptian Antiquities

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Department.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:10%
So I just gritted my
teeth and somehow I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:10%
managed to get myself
into the Great Pyramid.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:10%
This experiment consisted
of stretching a membrane

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:10%
across the open top of the
sarcophagus, this granite box.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the bottom of the
granite box, this time,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I had a small loudspeaker.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Sprinkling sand
onto the membrane

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
itself would create
the cymatics experiment

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to conduct.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics is the science
of sound made visible.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
We switched on the
electronic oscillator

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and expected to see a series
of geometric patterns.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Up to that point in
my career, that's

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
all I had ever seen-- just
simple geometric patterns.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
that a whole series

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.685 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs
began to emerge in the sand.

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:10%
I actually had no idea,
I had no expectation

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:10%
of seeing ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphs on this membrane.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:10%
But after about 20 minutes of
making sound in the sarcophagus

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and taking all these
photographs and seeing

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:10%
all these amazing ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs appearing

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:10%
on the membrane in
these sand patterns,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:10%
I suddenly realized that all
the pain in my lower back

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:10%
had left me.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that moment,
actually, the thought

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that went through my mind
was I know what this.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
This is endorphins.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
These are endorphins
flowing in my bloodstream.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy seeing
these and excited

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
seeing these ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, when I
get back out of the pyramid

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and get back to the hotel,
the pain will come back.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But the pain never
did come back.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
So that really got my attention.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this
is extraordinary.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
How could the pain
just suddenly vanish?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Remembering that I'd
been in severe pain

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
for up to three weeks
before going out to Egypt.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, of course, was
that the cymatics experiment

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
was phenomenally successful.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Seeing ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphs appear in sand

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
on a membrane in
the King's Chamber,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who would
have thought it?

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't
expect that at all.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:90%
This seemed to be designed.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
This didn't seem to
me to be happenstance.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought that somehow,
for some reason,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians had
decided to create this effect.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>> What we're realizing now as
cosmologists and as scientists

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:10%
across many fields of research
is coming to stand alongside

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:10%
these ancient spiritual
understandings.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:10%
That actually the
energy and matter

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:10%
and space and time
of our universe

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:10%
are expressions of
a deeper reality.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So they are the appearance
of our universe,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
but they're not its
foundational truth.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And its foundational
truth is that our universe

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
emerges from realms of
essentially cosmic causation,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:90%
intention.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So our universe has meaning
and purpose and a journey.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.503 align:middle line:90%
The ancients were very smart.

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were at
least as smart as we are,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:90%
they just had less stuff.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:10%

who weren't so distracted

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:10%
by developing new inventions
and all the stuff that we love

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:10%
and do all the time, what
was it that they had that we

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:10%
don't have?

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And what has been lost as
we've gained what we've got?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I came to Mexico the first
time in 1979 to Chichén Itzá,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:10%
which is a World Heritage
Site with two or three million

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:10%
people every year visiting,
and was stunned to see that

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:10%
their main pyramid was
dedicated to a snake.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.865 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's
that, you might say.

00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
I learned later

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that the mighty city of
Teotihuacán outside of Mexico

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
City, its central pyramid
is devoted to Quetzalcoatl,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:90%
the plumed serpent.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go around the
world, the biblical story

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
about the serpent, the
Aborigines in Australia,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
they worshipped a Rainbow
Serpent as their creator God.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
In China, serpentine
dragons were the big thing

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:90%
in divine matters, so to speak.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
People all over the world
would look upon serpents

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
as being the creator
gods, or dragons maybe.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear,
there's something here

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
modern people have lost
their contact with.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Our state of consciousness is
completely different from what

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
it was 1,000, 2,000 years
ago, and even more so

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:90%
if you go back 50,000 years ago.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
in the state of consciousness,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
they, as well as all our
ancient people saw that.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
serpents and dragons,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
they were living in a world of
spirits that most of us cannot

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
see in our current default
state of consciousness.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But in their default
state of consciousness,

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
it was possible to see
it and experience it.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
That means that they had access
to a domain of experience

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that, for the most part,
we don't have anymore.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic peoples, and I
would say Indigenous peoples

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
in general, they look upon
reality as multi-dimensional.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:84%
In the default state
of modern people,

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
it's just a rational
physical reality around them,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual experience
is about seeing

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
things that are outside
of our physical reality.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do I go when I die?

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:90%
It's such a beautiful question.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the answers
is, that you don't.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Your body goes in the
ground, we understand that.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Your personality diffuses in
whatever way that it does.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%
But you are already everywhere.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that you think
you're going to go somewhere?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:90%
You've always been there.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:10%
>> People seem to be more
concerned about what it takes

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:10%
on the way to death, what
the experience might be,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:10%
how you die.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:10%
So not necessarily
what comes after it,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:10%
but what leads up to it.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Long illnesses
and how might that

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
be more difficult than
dying all at once,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
let's say, or dropping
dead of a heart attack.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And, is one way of dying better
than another way of dying?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And the spirits will
even bring this up.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
They will discuss the experience
of what leads up to death.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:84%
How someone demonstrated their
love by caring for a person?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
What were the conversations
that were had?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
We have such issues
around dying.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It seems that that's where the
issues are, not around death

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:90%
itself as much.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We think that we
are losing people.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We think that there is no
way back to the relationship.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
That the relationship is lost.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.580 align:middle line:90%
The communication is lost.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The physicality of
that person is lost.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
What I have learned over
time is the physicality

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
is even part of our
spirit relationship.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So the spirits will
still have an effect

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
here in the physical world
because after all, they

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:90%
are energy.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And energy changes form,
but it doesn't disappear,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:90%
it isn't created.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:10%
And so in this way, things
in our life can move.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
We can be inspired.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There can be
continued connection

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:90%
with those who have passed.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My mother passed a
few years before my dad.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I
woke up from sleep.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And clear as AT&T can make
it, my mom's voice said,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:10%
your dad's going to die
soon and it's no big deal.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And he died soon.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So she's giving me
a little heads up.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
All the senses can be involved
rather than they hear a voice.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Like telepathically, when
my grandfather comes to me--

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
he's been long gone--

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I smell Captain
Black pipe tobacco.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people, their
grandmother's cookies.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was speaking to
a group of college students

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and giving messages, the
physicist Niels Bohr showed up

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
next to a young man who didn't
believe in this work at all.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He was gobsmacked because he was
writing a paper on Niels Bohr's

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
work and how it could be
furthered on this planet now.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:10%
There was a musician
who came to see me,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:10%
and Woody Guthrie showed up
with her-- surprise, surprise.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out she was
doing her first concert outdoors

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:90%
and it was Woody Guthrie music.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was there inspiring her.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:10%
Spirits we do not personally
know but may be connected

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:10%
through their work or a through
line of what they started here

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:10%
on this planet,
we can be inspired

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.835 align:middle line:10%
and we can be helped
by them as well.

00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
When we die, we
do not die alone.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Which is very important
for people to know,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
especially if they can't
be with a loved one.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Those in spirit who
have gone before

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
are actually present with
the person who is dying.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
No matter how quickly
that person may die,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
no matter how tragically,
no matter how suddenly,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:90%
no matter how traumatically.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a group that is present
helping that person to pass.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Now in some dramatic
situations, two young children

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
were killed by their father,
who then killed himself.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke with
these children,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
the father was not present.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So I spoke with just the boys.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So there is also
protection, separation,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
different frequencies
depending where people fall

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and what people's
intentions are.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So we are not forced to be
with the people who have maybe

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
affected our passing.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I've also spoken
with families who

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
have gone down
together in a plane

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
and they have been together.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They held hands
all the way through

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and were met by family members
who reached out and grabbed

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:90%
their hands.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And they walked-- they
didn't even crash.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They were out of their bodies
before the crash even happened.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So know that each person
is being taken care of.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The role of religion
can be facilitative.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
it may be like a pair

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:90%
of shoes you've grown out of.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:10%
So be discerning.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:10%
No baby out with the bathwater.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:10%
There's mystical traditions
in every religion that

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:10%
talk about ecstasy states,
talk about a lot of what

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about here.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
pedantic, legalistic type

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
of religious thought.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:10%
>> In karma what happens is
that you have many lives.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When I spent
time in Thailand,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I really dealt with
the idea of karma.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, who decides how we're
going to become conscious

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
again, or if we're going
to come back to this world?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
When people say, if
you're a good person

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:90%
you'll have a better next life.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Part of what the spirits do
when they speak to us is show

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:10%
us how to be free from
repetitive patterns which can

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:10%
look like karma but may be more
unhealed inheritances that we

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:10%
have received from
parent to child.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And whenever it looks like we're
stuck in a pattern we can't get

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:90%
out of, we may call that karma.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you even
want to come back here?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
To have a better car
and a better house?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And given the fact that
there's probably no time,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
who says that you
get better in order?

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were already
as good as you can get

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's your job to get
less better every time.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
We get to be thoughtful
about these things.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.552 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that happens with people

00:16:01.552 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
who meditate is, I
think, well, if I'm not

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
going to think about
the past or the future,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to think about?

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll think about
the nature of being.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.695 align:middle line:90%

>> I actually hid the abilities
that I had for many years

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:90%
because I wanted to fit in.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I worked in university
administration.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:10%
I worked in corporate human
resources for a major company.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:10%
And I guess life is what
happens while you're

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:10%
busy making other plans.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I had a near-death experience.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it
rearranged my priorities

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
about what's important to
me in life, in after life.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm devoted
to teaching people

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:84%
how to make their own direct
connection with their guides,

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%

who just turned seven, had

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:10%
They put him in intensive care.

And he was in that
space for six days.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
He never regained
consciousness but he

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%

when that happened and was given

And in those days, I didn't even
know who to talk to about it.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The morning of the sixth day,
Mary Fran's sister and I had

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:90%
a shift.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
From 3:00 to 5:00
AM in the morning,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:90%
we went and we sat with Nolan.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Hearing is the last
sense to go, so we were

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:90%
talking to him the whole time.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And we told him that
we loved him very much,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and that he had been
such a brave boy

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to try to stay with
us and to be with us

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and he was really fighting hard.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:90%
But if his mother came--

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember she had died in the
car accident six days before.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But if his mother
came, it was OK.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That he could leave
us and go with her.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> My throat started
honking like a goose,

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and then it started closing,
and then everything else went

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:90%
in slow motion.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Two doctors walked in.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The same technician that had
been doing the skin tests

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
with me came back with another
technician and all four of them

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:90%
were moving in slow motion.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
To me, my perception was
they're barely moving.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When he flatlined, what
I experienced was Mary Fran

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
crossing the veil,
coming to her son,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and scooping him up out
of his physical body.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Somehow I got to
feel that somehow I

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
got to be with them as they
were having this reunion.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was this
glorious expression

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of love between
mother and child.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there was
this popping sound.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Like if you hear
somebody pop the cork

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
on a bottle of champagne,
but it felt like it was off

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:90%
in the distance.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
But it was me leaving that body.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I stepped backwards and up
a little bit off the floor.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
at the back of my head

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and I had this weirdest thought.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're going to do

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in a near-death experience.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody prepares you for that.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my
hair and thought,

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got to fix that
spot right there.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And like, whoa, wait, I'm
looking at the back of my head.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And then to my surprise,
the two of them turned to me

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:90%
and came over and embraced me.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the three of us
lifted and went to the light.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>> All the medical professionals
continued to move in slow

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:10%
motion.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:10%
But now I noticed
they had changed.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it's my
perception that changed.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They looked flat like
cardboard cutouts.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:90%
They looked one-dimensional.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes were just dead.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing there,
where I was felt more real.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this
beautiful music.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:10%
>> These tears are a reflection
of this mixed emotion

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:10%
of the death of two people
that I really cared about,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.125 align:middle line:10%
that I loved.

00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And tears of the most amazing,
wondrous, loving universe

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that's out there that
is this far from us.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
That is where we go when we
lift out of our physical body,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:90%
and I got to be there.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt the arms of my
grandfather who has passed.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt him around me and
I just knew it was him.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, I
want to go with him.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's go see where that
music's coming from.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The three of us
were there for a while.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And then at some time--

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
time means because I'm

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
at a spot where it doesn't
seem to make sense anymore.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, they turned
and left and went further

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
into the light, and then I
came back to my physical body.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I heard this
very robotic voice say,

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
your work hasn't started yet.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was just starting to
see all these beautiful colors

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and next thing I know,
I'm back in the body,

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
they had an injection in me.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.505 align:middle line:84%
There was a technician holding
me up on this side and one

00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
holding me up on this
side because they

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
don't want you to lie down,
they want to hold you up.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
doctor said, she's breathing.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I had bilocated.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I was with Mary Fran
and Nolan in the light,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and I was in my physical
body at the same time.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had two distinctly
separate consciousnesses.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I split and was in
two locations at once.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because I have
such a clear memory of being

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
with Mary Fran and
Nolan and the light,

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and I have an
incredibly clear memory

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of being in the room with all
of the grieving relatives.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're holding each
other and hugging each other

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and crying on each
other's shoulder.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that my
face is showing this--

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.115 align:middle line:84%
the love of the universe was
wanting to break out of me.

00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And my face was
entirely inappropriate

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because I'm in joy, absolute
joy at where they are

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and what I've been
able to experience.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
That I know it's
going to be misread

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%
by the people in the room.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up covering
my face with my hands

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:90%
until I can compose myself.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
on at the same time

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:90%
as I'm with them in the light.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say
that's not part

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
of the lexicon of the
Presbyterian tradition.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
This idea that in the moment
of our greatest grief,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the moment
of my greatest joy.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm in two
locations at once.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can have complete
communion with Mary Fran

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and Nolan and
communion with whatever

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
all that is at the same time.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have words for
that for the longest time.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Near-death is when you
start to take that journey

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:10%
of dropping the veil and going
into the other side of life.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:10%
But you don't get
all the way there.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:84%
You get pulled
back into the body.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So for me to tell you
I know exactly what

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
heaven is like, the other side,
whatever you want to call it,

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
from a near-death experience
doesn't really work.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like I fly from
Phoenix to Singapore.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I get to Singapore,
I get off the plane,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I walk around the
airport, and then I

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:84%
get right back on the
plane back to Phoenix.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you a
thing about Singapore,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.615 align:middle line:90%
but the airport's nice.

00:25:07.615 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> DMT is dimethyltryptamine.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
That is a molecule
that's found--

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
it's widespread in
the animal kingdom.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:10%
It's used a lot in
shamanic rituals

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:10%
for mystical experiences
and things like that.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:10%
And we synthesize
it, we make it.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:10%
And new cool research showed
that it's made in our brain,

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:10%
it's made in our choroid plexus,
it's made in the pineal gland.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And what endogenously--
endogenous means

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:90%
what's in ourselves--

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
what it does endogenously,
we don't know yet.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They did induce
cardiac arrest in a rat

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and showed that during
the cardiac arrest,

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
this level of DMT greatly
increased in the visual cortex.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know what that is.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It was hypothesized
that it's present

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
when you're born, when
we die, and possibly

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
during dream states,
so vivid dream states,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
near death experiences.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it was
actually increased--

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that it increased
in concentration

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
in the visual cortex while
these rats were undergoing

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:90%
cardiac arrest is interesting.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Because many people have
described near-death

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
experiences where they've
seen bright lights or some--

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
where there's an image,
there's images coming to them.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So could that be because an
increase in DMT help people

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:90%
have those visions?

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucid dreaming is
all about awareness.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:10%
We're all aware right
now in the waking state,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:10%
we're effortlessly aware
and awake and conscious.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:10%
And in the dream state,
very often, we just

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:10%
slide down into unconsciousness.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But the amazing thing is when
we raise our level of awareness

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in the dream state,
then we become conscious

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and we are then able to
interact with the dream

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
as we feel is best.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:84%
This waking up to
the dream state

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
enables us to engage consciously
with our deepest unconscious

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:90%
images and emotions.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
powerful thing

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
because it means

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can react and respond
while a nightmare is happening,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:84%
There are people who can just--
they will have these recurring

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.600 align:middle line:90%
nightmares of being chased.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
manage, finally,

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to become lucid in that
recurring nightmare.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll turn around to face
their aggressor, their chaser.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And they will say, why
are you following me?

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the person will
respond, well, I don't know.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought you needed
me to follow you.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You need me for your fear,
or something like that.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the dreamer
will realize, wow,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
my fear is self-created
to some extent.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And I can change it.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to have
these nightmares every night.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I can change what's
happening in my unconscious.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And then very often,
they will then

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
find that in their
waking life, they

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
become less anxious because
something has shifted.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
When something shifts inside
us on the unconscious level,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:90%
our waking life shifts as well.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a dream
that we're having.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical vibration
dream, daily reality.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:10%
And then the higher
part of the mental realm

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:10%
is inspiration
and getting guides

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:10%
and teachers and visions,
and all kinds of great stuff.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Very fluid, higher
level mental ideas.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So at night-- and
even during the day.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
You may be at your desk
and then suddenly something

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:84%
makes you think and
you're daydreaming,

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
or you're off thinking about
something that reminded you

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:90%
of this other thing.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back to
your body and you're, oh.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're in and out, a lot even
in the daytime, but at night,

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:84%
especially, because
we can really travel.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the left
brain's gone to sleep.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It is not judging anything.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.497 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the way.

00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:13.906 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When we wake
up inside a dream,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
it feels almost as if we've
been watching a black and white

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:84%
movie and then it
suddenly turns to color.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so
vibrant, it feels

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
as if the objects are imbued
with conscious awareness.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We can touch things and
they feel super real.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
We can hear, we can
smell, we can taste.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.550 align:middle line:10%
I actually know one guy
who keeps himself lucid,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:10%
who stays lucid in the
dream by licking things.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:10%
So he tastes whatever the
dream tastes or he'll just

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:10%
lick something to raise
his consciousness,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:10%
to make him stay
lucid in the dream.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, one of the
dangers when you become lucid

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is you're so excited
to be lucid in a dream

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:90%
that you just lose awareness.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:90%
You wake up and it's gone.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn as well how
to stay in that lucid state.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
If you stare at a fixed
point in a lucid dream,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:90%
you're more likely to wake up.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.193 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps because a lot of lucid
dreams take place in rapid eye

00:30:15.193 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:84%
movement sleep, where there's
always this little eye

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:90%
movement going on.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So to keep that going, just look
around and explore the dream.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Examine the dream,
engage with it,

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
touch it to get that clarity,
to keep yourself on that raised

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It really helps to reach
out and touch something.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Engage with what's around us.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
If there's a tree there, go and
run your hand down the bark.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:84%
If you see a friend,
give them a hug.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Or just simply rub
your hands together.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.240 align:middle line:84%
That can really, really
help to just wake you

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
up a little bit more so that
you stay lucid for longer.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:84%
A really good way to
begin to have lucid dreams

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is to try to raise your level of
awareness in your waking life.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:84%
You can do that by
asking yourself regularly

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
day, am I dreaming?

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Am I dreaming this right now?

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And really look around
and think about it.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't just dismiss it.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that we're
not dreaming right now?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
This is how real it
can be in a dream.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Dreams fool us all the
time with their reality.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
You can do reality
checks as well.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You can say, OK, well, let's
see if I'm dreaming or not.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll see if I can't put
my finger through my hand.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and if you really,
really can't, then

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I guess you're awake.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Also the nose pinch, where you
pinch your nostrils closed.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that
when we're awake,

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we can't breathe
through our nose.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it
in a dream, you can

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't blocked
your physical nostrils.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:84%
You can mix it up with those
little kind of reality checks.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We can have the feeling that we
live an entire lifetime in one

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.010 align:middle line:90%
lucid dream.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Time flows differently.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Research studies
have been done to see

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
if lucid dreamers can count
time the way that we count it.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:90%
So counting out the seconds.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
pretty good at doing that.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So time is a funny
thing in general,

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:90%
but also in lucid dreams.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is such
an amazing thing.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It saves everything
you've ever heard.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So in my dreams, I
used to fly to France.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.360 align:middle line:10%
People were speaking in
exactly the way they had spoken

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:10%
when I was living in France.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that helped me to
really practice my French.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:84%
When we practiced a particular
skill in a lucid dream,

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
scientists believe
that strengthens

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
the neuronal pathways
in the brain.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a
fist-clenching experiment

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:90%
that was carried out.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.950 align:middle line:84%
They asked subjects to clench
their fists while awake,

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:84%
clench their fists
in their imagination.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And then to become
lucid in a dream,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and then clench their fist.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And so researchers
were able to see

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the fist-clenching
in a lucid dream

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:84%
will actually light up
the same part of the brain

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:90%
as if we did it in waking life.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely something
to this whole connection,

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:84%
this physical connection with
what we do in the dream state.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> To me, it's all real.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:10%
We are functioning at different
frequencies of ourselves

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:10%
in the different dream zones.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.673 align:middle line:10%
So if you start
recording your dreams

00:33:18.673 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and you figure out what
you're doing at night,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:10%
you can start to see what your
growth process is all about.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Because often, a lot of
the subconscious stuff

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:84%
will pop up in the dreams that
you wouldn't allow yourself

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:84%
to have in the waking
state because you

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:90%
have a monitor on it.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
think about that.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But at night, sure,
it pops right through.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's very helpful.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And also for just loosening
up your creativity.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It's such a nice,
wonderful rubbery state

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can do all
kinds of things in there

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and whatever you want.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of freedom.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you play with that,
you can start to see,

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
well, I could do that
when I'm awake too.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's very empowering.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:10%
>> It's being found that we can
improve sports skills when we

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:10%
are lucid in our dream.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
One guy would magic
a swimming pool

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and he would practice his
swim strokes really precisely,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
really feeling his body
moving through the water.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes for fun,
he would be a bit playful

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and he'd make the swimming
pool fill with yogurt or honey.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The end of the story was
that he got the highest

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.279 align:middle line:90%
mark possible for his swimming.

00:34:29.279 --> 00:34:32.377 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.377 --> 00:34:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> With psychic phenomena,
how do you know that you feel

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:90%
anything?

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.514 align:middle line:84%
It's all about your
internal sense of awareness.

00:34:39.514 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of
different kinds of experiences

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.599 align:middle line:90%
that people talk about.

00:34:42.599 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:10%
You have clairvoyance, which,
in its modern euphemism,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:10%
is remote viewing,
which is perceiving

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:10%
through space and time.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.219 align:middle line:10%
The time part is sometimes
called precognition.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you see backwards in
time, so that's retrocognition.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
This kind of experience
is you go to a place

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and you see people in
period costumes apparently

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and everything looks old.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You're wondering,
what's happening here?

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like a retro
cognitive sense of the place,

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:90%
but sometime in the past.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Precognition is, in my
view, a human birthright.

00:35:19.377 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think
there's evidence

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:90%
that other animals have it.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:10%
But certainly among humans,
I think everyone has it.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.070 align:middle line:10%
And the question is, can
you get conscious of it,

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.770 align:middle line:10%
and what's your skill level
with communicating it to others?

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And so you can learn that.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You can learn to
get conscious of it,

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and you can learn to
communicate it to others.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
musical ability.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's that hard
to teach most people how

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.845 align:middle line:84%
to hum a simple tune,
which is, I think,

00:35:41.845 --> 00:35:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of
teaching people

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.637 align:middle line:84%
how to do controlled
precognition.

00:35:44.637 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Most people can do it.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.383 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually impressed
with themselves when they do it

00:35:48.383 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because we don't usually think
we can predict the future.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But to get to the level of skill
that it's operational and can

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
be used, like to become an opera
singer or the first violinist

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
in a symphony orchestra, there's
a lot of practice involved.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And you probably wouldn't
practice that much

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.180 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't have
that initial talent.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I was a returning student
living in the Chicago area.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
After taking several years
off to get married and have

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.970 align:middle line:84%
kids and all that thing, I had
recently come across a paper

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that Hal Puthoff
and Russell Targ

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.890 align:middle line:84%
had published about their
remote viewing work.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:10%
They mentioned in the paper
that sometimes the percipient

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:10%
could describe the scene
before it was selected.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:10%
And I came up short on that.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, the distance
part doesn't bother me,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:90%
but the time part, I don't know.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.890 align:middle line:90%
That's really hard to swallow.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And when we study
intuition in a science form,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:10%
often we'll call it remote
viewing because there,

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:10%
the person has no way to
know the information except

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:10%
for psychically.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So there I was, a suburban
housewife on a Sunday afternoon

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:90%
folding laundry.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking about this.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
about it and I said,

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just think
about a friend of mine

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and see if I can figure
out where she's going

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:90%
to be at 5:30 this evening.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll call her tonight
and find out where she was.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The thought had no
sooner hit me than I

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
had this image or this
feeling of her walking

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, which
was not something

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that was typical for her.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:84%
She would have been bike riding
or playing tennis or something.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'll
just call her later

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.600 align:middle line:90%
and see where she was at 5:30.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.420 align:middle line:84%
This was at about
4:00 o'clock or 4:30.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, 5:20 or so comes,
the doorbell rings.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:84%
There's my friend standing
outside and saying,

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been going
stir crazy and I was

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
thinking it would be nice to
go take a walk in the woods.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to come?

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And after I picked my
chin up off the floor,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I was just blown away.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I decided this was too much.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:90%
I had to explore it.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:10%
>> I created a protocol, for
what I call distant viewing

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:10%
in those days, in my back garden
of this house that I was in.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I laid out a grid
that was 12 squares.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would take mason
jars and put things in them

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and bury them in this grid.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I had a mimeograph paper--

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that's how old this
was, mimeographs--

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:90%
that was just the grid.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would send it
out to people and say,

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
can you try to locate
which square in the grid

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
has something buried
there, and can you

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:90%
describe for me what it is.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that
people could do it.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> A computer may pick a
target that no human has seen

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
in California, and the remote
viewer may be in Virginia.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They will draw that target
out with such precision

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that if you wanted to know, say,
the target was a dish, where

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:84%
the dish was made and
how many kids the person

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
who packed the dish
into the container had,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.560 align:middle line:84%
you could find that
information out.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can access all
information without regard

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:90%
to time or space.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:84%
You can go forward in the
future, back in the past.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the researchers who
do this kind of work start out

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.450 align:middle line:90%
with, is this stuff real?

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:84%
My question was, what can you
do with it of practical utility,

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:84%
how can you do that, and
what is it telling us

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:84%
about who we are as human beings
and our place in the universe?

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge
discussion at that time.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Most archeological finds
were made serendipitously.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They were doing road work
and they revealed a temple,

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
or some farmer was
plowing in a field

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and found a burial or whatever.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.540 align:middle line:84%
We used this protocol that I had
designed in Alexandria, Egypt

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to locate the
Palace of Cleopatra,

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:84%
the Palace of Mark
Antony, the Timonium,

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:84%
the Lighthouse of
Pharos, one of the seven

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:90%
wonders of the ancient world.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:90%
You can see this.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It's upon YouTube, The
Alexandria Project.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:90%
You can find it.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Watch it happen.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Our remote viewer
here, Joe McMoneagle,

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.000 align:middle line:10%
has found ancient temple sites
in Japan that nobody knew

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.800 align:middle line:10%
about.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.175 align:middle line:84%
He has worked with
the government

00:40:22.175 --> 00:40:25.000 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years in their
program, and could draw,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:84%
in high detail, the inside of
a new submarine the Soviets had

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:90%
before it was ever launched.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I wouldn't do
classified research.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:10%
I felt that anything we
knew about consciousness,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:10%
given the state of
humanity, we ought

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:10%
to make immediately available.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Could remote viewers locate
an unknown shipwreck on the sea

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:90%
floor?

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:84%
That is, could they look through
hundreds of feet of seawater

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and locate a previously
unknown wreck on the sea floor?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So I got a chart and I
sent it out to 11 people.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them,
please go over this chart

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:90%
and locate an unknown sea wreck.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:84%
That came to be known
as Project Deep Quest.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I filmed it also,
it's up on YouTube.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I got Leonard Nimoy
to narrate it.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We are dancing with parts
greater than ourselves that we

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.670 align:middle line:90%
don't fully understand.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
That may be our higher self,
it may be guides and angels,

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:84%
it may be God, it
may be all kinds

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of things that were accessing
beyond our personality and ego.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Precognition in remote
viewing are related

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that precognition
is a larger umbrella term that

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:10%
includes multiple ways in which
you could be precognitive.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.287 align:middle line:84%
So one way is
physiologically, your body

00:41:45.287 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:84%
can predict future events that
you don't even consciously know

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:90%
it's predicting.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.048 align:middle line:84%
Before an important
event occurs,

00:41:51.048 --> 00:41:53.090 align:middle line:84%
you might have had the
experience of a zing going

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
through your body, like,
wait, something's going on.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> They did a study based on
a factor called interoception.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:10%
That's when you're able
to sense your heartbeat

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.530 align:middle line:10%
or sense your viscera.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:10%
Some people are
very good at that.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.020 align:middle line:10%
For reasons I don't understand,
I can just sit down and be calm

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and I can feel my
heartbeat all the time.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, other people can't.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So people who are good
at that tend to do much,

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:84%
much better in terms of day
trading with futures than ones

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%
who don't.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you can learn
to pay attention

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:84%
to these what amounts to
signals coming from your body.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, you could
get better at it.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the common ones is
you're driving to work one day

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're reaching
an intersection.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.987 align:middle line:84%
You have a green
light, everything

00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
seems to be working fine.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.850 align:middle line:84%
You have an internal sense that
something's not quite right

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.313 align:middle line:90%
so you start slowing down.

00:42:39.313 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And people behind
you are thinking

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.320 align:middle line:90%
what is wrong with you.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So you slow down, slow down.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You still have a green light
and you're going really slow,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly somebody
shoots through the red light

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and would have hit you broadside
if you didn't slow down.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that suggests that his
peripheral vision, maybe you

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
saw something you didn't
even realize you saw it.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But maybe also you
had a premonition

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.788 align:middle line:84%
that something bad
was about to happen.

00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you didn't know
exactly what it was,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:90%
but you just slowed down anyway.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So we take that into the
laboratory into an experiment

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.870 align:middle line:84%
we call presentiment,
which is not precognition.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.415 align:middle line:84%
It's not pre-knowing,
but it's pre-feeling.

00:43:14.415 --> 00:43:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Since it's not
something that you know,

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to use your body
as an indicator of what's

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.240 align:middle line:90%
about to happen.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.640 align:middle line:84%
We measure your heart rate
or your skin conductance

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.400 align:middle line:84%
or your pupil dilation
or your brainwaves.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we measure all
of them at the same time.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Having someone in the room
that knows what the target is,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is going to make you
potentially tune in to what

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.070 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking about
instead of the actual event.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You can use a random number
generator to produce events,

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
like showing a picture of a
plane crash versus a picture

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.687 align:middle line:90%
of a pair of shoes.

00:43:44.687 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:90%
So something more neutral.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.570 align:middle line:84%
No one on the planet
knows what the target is,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.278 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
actually get information

00:43:49.278 --> 00:43:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that you know is free
of anyone else's bias.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If, in fact, you're feeling
your future physiological

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
state, maybe that you
feel something in your gut

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.120 align:middle line:90%
that's not quite right.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Then before you see one of these
negative or emotional pictures,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:84%
maybe the body begins to
become more emotional even

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:84%
though, in this case, there's no
peripheral information at all.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It has to come from the
future because nobody

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:84%
knows in advance
what's about to show up

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.680 align:middle line:90%
by the design of the experiment.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So this experiment has been
done many, many times now.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see beforehand,
when you analyze the data,

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
the physiology leading up

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to the randomly selected
emotional image versus

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.730 align:middle line:84%
the randomly selected
neutral image.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Virtually, every
physiological measure that we

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:84%
look at does respond between
around 1 and 9 seconds before

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:84%
the image comes up in
an appropriate way.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.690 align:middle line:84%
That's an example of taking a
relatively common experience,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.580 align:middle line:84%
putting it into a
laboratory context

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:84%
where it's extremely
controlled, and that you

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.740 align:middle line:84%
can exclude all of the
usual mundane explanations.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you're left
with is apparently

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we can know
between 1 and 9 seconds

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
or so what is about to happen.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Do we look into the future,
or do we somehow or other tap

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:05.500 align:middle line:10%
into the probabilities
of a possible future?

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to that.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe the future
is set and absolute.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I think, like
everything else, there's

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:90%
a probabilistic aspect to it.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Another example is
compulsive precognition,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:10%
where you don't know why
you have to do something,

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.230 align:middle line:10%
you just have to do it.

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:10%
And then once you
do it, you come back

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.815 align:middle line:10%
and you recognize, oh, if I had
been there during that time,

00:45:27.815 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:10%
something horrible
would have happened.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.732 align:middle line:10%
There's an officer in the
military, relatively high up,

00:45:31.732 --> 00:45:34.720 align:middle line:10%
and he's in Iraq in his van.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:10%
And he was just waiting around
for the next thing to happen.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was really hot.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting
on a cooler of water.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So he could absolutely have
had some water from the cooler.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what he did.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:90%
He felt compelled.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I don't want water.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I want this kind of iced tea
that I have to get up out

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.123 align:middle line:90%
of here to go get.

00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Now that's ridiculous.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I could just have the water.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Nope, I'm going to
get the iced tea.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So he stands up, he goes and
gets the iced tea, comes back.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And he can't go back because
a mortar had landed right

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:90%
near the van.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.352 align:middle line:84%
If he had been there,
he might have been right

00:46:08.352 --> 00:46:09.560 align:middle line:90%
in the way of this situation.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.875 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
compulsive precognition.

00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> How can you explain a
phenomenon that doesn't respond

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:90%
to space and time?

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's an anecdotal story.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not an experiment.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The only conclusion I
personally can come to is that

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.490 align:middle line:84%
space and time are not
characteristics of the physical

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.300 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They are characteristics
of our consciousness.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Or, as Albert
Einstein once said,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.110 align:middle line:84%
they're there to keep everything
from happening all at once.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The basic message is time
doesn't work the way we think

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.070 align:middle line:90%
it does.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
information through time

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.172 align:middle line:84%
and use that information
if you're compelled to,

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and if you feel
you have the talent

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:50.925 align:middle line:90%
and you want to develop it.

00:46:50.925 --> 00:46:53.050 align:middle line:10%
>> If information is flowing
from the outside world

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:57.550 align:middle line:10%
into you, it's somewhat passive,
this would be called the ESP.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.610 align:middle line:10%
So it's precognition
and clairvoyance.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:84%
If the information is going out
from you somehow and changing

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the world, then
it's psychokinetic.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Most people would define
that as affecting matter with

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:10%
your mind.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Using your intention to
change or manipulate the world

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.770 align:middle line:90%
in some way outside of yourself.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They said explore,
experiment, expand,

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.520 align:middle line:84%
play to really
widen your horizons.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We were having a time to
play with the energies

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.300 align:middle line:90%
we'd been working with.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And we had a gaming night.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:90%
There were dice there.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself going
into that same energy--

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:37.540 align:middle line:84%
wide open heart, warm hands,
connected to the Earth really

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.430 align:middle line:84%
strongly, but connected
with spirit as well.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found I could roll
what I wanted on the dice.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:48.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so seven, seven in a
row, that kind of thing.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:49.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's studiable.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things I'm
really interested in

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is when we do PK versus rest
when there's no psychokinesis.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.180 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in the brain?

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So we do a 128 lead
EEG on a person's head.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And we find real
interesting EEG results

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:84%
when the PK is going on
versus control or rest times.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of those things
are boring in a lab

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and tough to do because
that one, for example,

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is 48 seconds on, 48
seconds off, 48 seconds on

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds trials in a row
after spending the half hour

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.900 align:middle line:90%
getting that EEG on.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm a psychologist so I
looked at the motivation

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to keep this really
juicy for people

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.590 align:middle line:84%
so their performance would not
rise and then fall and become

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.740 align:middle line:90%
boring to them.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
Vegas stuff comes in.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's definitely exciting
when you do it in Vegas and you

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:84%
hit something at 200
million to 1 by chance.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You might also have some cash to
show as a prize for doing that.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:52.870 align:middle line:84%
In meditation, for example,
before I go to a slot machine,

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I may visualize exactly what
I want, such as a royal flush

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:90%
in hearts.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:84%
That's 160,000 to 1 by chance,
and I'll go down and hit it

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.300 align:middle line:90%
in the first pull.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So that gives me proof
that this was real.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I've meditated.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I've raised my energy.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I go down, I'm also
checking intuition as the time

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:84%
right now and is this
the machine to do it on.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If you wanted to
understand the data underlying

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.760 align:middle line:84%
precognition, there's a bunch
of information out there.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Go to Google Scholar and just
look up precognitive abilities.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You could also look up
predictive anticipatory

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.630 align:middle line:84%
activity to find any
of that information.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:31.240 align:middle line:90%
So go have at it.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.200 align:middle line:84%
If what that data
were about some kind

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of new drug for some
kind of disease,

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.970 align:middle line:84%
people would be taking
the drug for that disease.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.130 align:middle line:10%
My experience going
into the academic world

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.720 align:middle line:10%
and giving talks
about this stuff

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.150 align:middle line:10%
to, basically, people
who are largely

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.898 align:middle line:10%
interested but skeptical, first
of all, they'll ask questions,

00:49:48.898 --> 00:49:50.190 align:middle line:10%
well, have you thought of this?

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.270 align:middle line:10%
And often, they'll
have you thought

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:10%
of this will be like the most
basic thing that, of course,

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.730 align:middle line:10%
you thought of.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're just learning to
think about this so they're

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.060 align:middle line:90%
going to-- they should ask.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But after the talk, they'll come
up to you and, one by one, say,

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.320 align:middle line:90%
can I talk to you afterwards?

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Can we just talk privately?

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I just want to tell
you my experience

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.933 align:middle line:84%
I had about this dream
that was so real,

00:50:09.933 --> 00:50:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it happened
the next day.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the next person,
can I just have your card?

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And then you get an email--

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to say it
in front of anyone else,

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.140 align:middle line:84%
but I had this experience
the night before my aunt died

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and she wasn't sick and--

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and then the next person,
and the next person.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I started
saying, talk to each other.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
You're all having
this experience.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Talk to each other.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The topic is
so controversial,

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.080 align:middle line:10%
you cannot get it published.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.920 align:middle line:10%
We tried to send one paper
into a physics journal.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:84%
The editor thought it was fine,
but the publishers, the higher

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.780 align:middle line:84%
ups, were very uncomfortable
with the topic.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when you send
a paper for publication,

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:84%
they send it to two, maybe
three reviewers or referees.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, this paper went out to
something like 21 referees.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was getting
really rather silly.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Until at one point, we
said, look, why don't we

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.610 align:middle line:84%
just go with the majority
vote, at a point when

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.830 align:middle line:90%
we knew we were one ahead.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And the paper got published.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I worked at the University
of Nevada in Las Vegas

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.480 align:middle line:10%
for a while.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.570 align:middle line:10%
And so there, one of
the sociologists I knew

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.990 align:middle line:10%
was studying prostitution
in Las Vegas.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, Las Vegas
businesspeople did not

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:84%
like it to be known publicly
that this was going on,

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.840 align:middle line:84%
even though everybody
knew that it was.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And so her ability to do
that research and publish it

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.660 align:middle line:84%
was tamped down to the point
where she could not do it.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one
of many examples

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.730 align:middle line:84%
where if there's some
community that says,

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.540 align:middle line:84%
we don't want that to be out
there, they will stop it.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We can look back at tobacco
and all kinds of things

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that were, at one
time, suppressed

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.070 align:middle line:84%
for political or
business reasons.

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's no different
in this domain.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some things that
are very hard to get with

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.360 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.770 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to get analytical
things like names or numbers

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:10%
or dates.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But remote viewers are really
good at describing the sense

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.940 align:middle line:90%
impressions about an object.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So, could you communicate
with a submarine

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:90%
using associated imagery?

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So I needed a submarine.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
John Warner, who was the
Secretary of the Navy,

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.610 align:middle line:84%
invited me to go up to
Groton, Connecticut with him.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.710 align:middle line:10%
And on the plane
was Hyman Rickover,

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.290 align:middle line:10%
the father of the
American nuclear navy

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:27.910 align:middle line:10%
and the nuclear submarines.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he would
let me do this experiment.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.113 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let
me get back to you.

00:52:33.113 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about it.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:90%
He was quite interested in it.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.670 align:middle line:10%
And he called me, I don't
know, a week, 10 days later.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:43.400 align:middle line:10%
And he said, that's a really
interesting experiment

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.590 align:middle line:10%
but I'm not going to do it.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.807 align:middle line:84%
It'll leak out, it'll
get a lot of attention,

00:52:46.807 --> 00:52:47.890 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't want it.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sorry, I'm
not going to do it.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I did a consulting job for
a big hotel chain that wanted

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.770 align:middle line:10%
to integrate empathy
into their core values.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Real empathy.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The kind of empathy that
doesn't resolve easily

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.150 align:middle line:84%
into a spreadsheet to
help them understand

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:09.080 align:middle line:84%
what it was to actually be
tuned in with another person.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
available to that message.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They wanted it in theory, but
in practice, it was a grind.

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I know a lot of my colleagues
who have had their labs burned

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:10%
down and their lives threatened
and things like that.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:27.570 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, I guess
my angels are working hard.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>> There's always a worldview
by which science is bounded more

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.340 align:middle line:10%
or less.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.350 align:middle line:10%
But if you ask questions that
go beyond that conventional

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:39.650 align:middle line:10%
worldview, you're out
there in frontier science.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have to be in the
lab and do the experiments

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.990 align:middle line:84%
because most conventional
scientists won't.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's different from what
some people might call fringe

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:53.150 align:middle line:84%
science, which is really far
out topics that aren't necessary

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:57.440 align:middle line:84%
substantiated by
experiment conjectures.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But my science is largely
experimental, also

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.970 align:middle line:84%
with some theory
underlying it, where

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:08.810 align:middle line:84%
we try to validate
what we're studying

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:90%
by scientific experiments.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.730 align:middle line:10%
>> My attitude is, well, if
they accept it, that's great.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:17.490 align:middle line:10%
I don't care what the mainstream
people criticize, or whatever

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.410 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to do the work.

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not recognized
while I'm living,

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.650 align:middle line:84%
it will be recognized
50 years from now.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I remember going to
a conference in the UK.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:10%
I think that was 2003.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.810 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, 2003, I think it was.

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
doing my PhD while I

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.740 align:middle line:90%
sleep in my lucid dreams.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm doing
my research, which

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.390 align:middle line:90%
is a bit preposterous to hear.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:90%
But it was true.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But people in the
audience were like, what

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:84%
are you saying, how
could that be possible,

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and lucid dreaming doesn't
really exist, and all of this.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so then I gave them
the scientific facts.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And some people as
well in that audience

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.990 align:middle line:84%
came up to me afterwards and
said, I'm a psychoanalyst

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and I have worked for
30 years with dreams

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and I've never heard
about lucid dreaming.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could
really help my clients.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1960s, there was a
lot of research going on with

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:10%
psychedelics.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, that got pushed
underground very quickly

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:11.540 align:middle line:10%
and it became illegal.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.030 align:middle line:10%
That is rising very
quickly as well.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you
start doing research

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.320 align:middle line:84%
on something as dramatic as
a psychedelic experience,

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.970 align:middle line:84%
you realize that there's a whole
bunch of very useful things

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.560 align:middle line:90%
that you can do in those states.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.510 align:middle line:84%
People who have a
terminal illness

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and are facing enormous amounts
of fear and angst over it,

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:32.270 align:middle line:84%
they can have a psychedelic
experience, which gives them

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:35.950 align:middle line:84%
a mystical experience, and
their fear of death vanishes.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They will say then, not only
terminally ill patients,

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.710 align:middle line:84%
but other people will say
that the experience they

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.370 align:middle line:84%
have under the right conditions
with something like psilocybin

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is the most profound experience
in their entire life.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's pretty good.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite different than
the chaos that was surrounding

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:57.230 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics in the '60s.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's more mature
now, more controlled.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's an example of where
aspects of consciousness that

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.880 align:middle line:84%
are normally pushed aside,
as like the only thing

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:84%
you should pay attention to
is the here and now, well,

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.600 align:middle line:84%
that's a very small
slice of reality.

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.170 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a lot of important
issues and we each just have

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:17.980 align:middle line:10%
our piece of the puzzle.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:10%
But the more we can
understand and know

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.720 align:middle line:10%
what our piece of the
puzzle is and do that

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.590 align:middle line:10%
without the resistance that
comes from being told that what

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.870 align:middle line:10%
we want to do is
wrong, then I think

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:10%
we can really, collectively,
make a huge difference.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:10%
>> In the academic world, you
can study these phenomena from

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.150 align:middle line:10%
the point of view
of anthropology,

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:39.700 align:middle line:10%
certainly from psychology in
terms of belief and what people

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.500 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But from a scientific
perspective,

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.880 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very rare
to find anywhere

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.790 align:middle line:84%
in the world which is
using scientific approaches

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to studying these
phenomena, even

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.810 align:middle line:84%
though most people actually
have these experiences.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strange taboo,
but it's quite strong.

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Someone would say, well,
you're now assuming that mental

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.520 align:middle line:10%
things are somehow different
than physical things.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.100 align:middle line:10%
And mental things
behave differently

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:10%
than the rules we expect
for physical things

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.940 align:middle line:10%
where causality
is a certain way.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.573 align:middle line:90%
That's a common discussion.

00:57:07.573 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, so
what's your evidence

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.615 align:middle line:84%
that mental things aren't
different from physical things?

00:57:11.615 --> 00:57:13.770 align:middle line:84%
They sure seem
different in every way.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Having a thought sure seems like
something that isn't physical.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have any physical
properties like location.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The thought of the color green
has no location, has no mass,

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.480 align:middle line:84%
it has no frequency, no
spin, no phase, no charge.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.600 align:middle line:84%
How is it in any way like
anything else that's physical?

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.150 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, then
that's dualism--

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.262 align:middle line:90%
which is just a bludgeon.

00:57:36.262 --> 00:57:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I say, of
course, it's dualism.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying mental
and physical things

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.052 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:57:40.052 --> 00:57:41.538 align:middle line:90%
That's two, that's dualism.

00:57:41.538 --> 00:57:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And then there's nothing.

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no argument.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So the argument is
just, you can't possibly

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.880 align:middle line:84%
be a dualist because
that's not allowed

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.752 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
science, you see.

00:57:52.752 --> 00:57:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Because mental things
don't really exist,

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.080 align:middle line:90%
but physical things do.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And the history of that has
a lot to do with behaviorism.

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.650 align:middle line:84%
At least in psychology,
it has a lot

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to do with behaviorism
coming out.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Behaviorism was all
about, we're going

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what's going
on in people's minds, which

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:10.210 align:middle line:84%
don't really exist, by looking
at the input and output

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.100 align:middle line:84%
relationships because
that's what we can see.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.140 align:middle line:90%
What if we actually went inside?

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The thing about mental things
rather than physical things

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.480 align:middle line:84%
is you can actually
go inside experiences

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're
having an experience

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and you can discover things.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a different--
that's a different tool.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a
scientific tool.

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Students, especially, they
would love to study psychic

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.450 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.562 align:middle line:84%
And yet you don't see it
in the academic world.

00:58:33.562 --> 00:58:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
administrators.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.850 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
senior professors.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.770 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
people who hold

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:43.330 align:middle line:10%
what amounts to the acceptable
topics to talk about.

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a fear, often, that
can constrain you in academia.

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.400 align:middle line:84%
The underlying fear is the
fear of being shamed for not

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.503 align:middle line:90%
being right, for being a fool.

00:58:53.503 --> 00:58:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be a fool.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
academia is, we're

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.548 align:middle line:84%
going to figure out
what's really going on

00:58:57.548 --> 00:58:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
be right about it.

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
understand this,

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.040 align:middle line:84%
you don't really understand
what's really going on.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.010 align:middle line:90%
You're a fool.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be on
the outside of the cult.

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The university administrator
just does not want anything bad

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.100 align:middle line:90%
to happen ever.

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're more afraid
of being embarrassed

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.370 align:middle line:90%
than they are of dying.

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.328 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to have
to explain to somebody,

00:59:15.328 --> 00:59:16.870 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, we have
in this department,

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.610 align:middle line:90%
we're studying this weird stuff.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They just say, no, we're
not doing anything weird.

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.410 align:middle line:90%
We're completely normal.

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:27.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the administrator
mindset, which I understand.

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.652 align:middle line:84%
Only unusual places, unusual
universities or institutes

00:59:30.652 --> 00:59:33.110 align:middle line:84%
like ours where we say, well,
we don't care what you think.

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:34.670 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're doing
because we think it's

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:35.990 align:middle line:90%
an interesting thing to do.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> See, at PEAR, we
were very fortunate.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.910 align:middle line:84%
We had an
interdisciplinary staff.

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.570 align:middle line:84%
We had physicists, and
psychologists, and engineers.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:10%
All of these people
working together

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.920 align:middle line:10%
on a topic that had no answers.

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.930 align:middle line:10%
We didn't even
know the questions.

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:54.200 align:middle line:10%
But we did find that when
we put our heads together,

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.250 align:middle line:10%
each of us coming from our
own unique point of view,

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:02.030 align:middle line:10%
we were discovering things that
we never would have seen alone.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.115 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look back,
maybe 30 years ago,

01:00:04.115 --> 01:00:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and you were trying to
find conferences to go

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to on consciousness, it would
have been very, very difficult.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Both in the public domain
and in the academic domains,

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.210 align:middle line:90%
they didn't happen.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.552 align:middle line:90%
Now we're saturated with them.

01:00:16.552 --> 01:00:18.260 align:middle line:84%
There are conferences
all over the place,

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
around the world
on consciousness

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
and aspects of consciousness.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And it includes philosophy
and science and neuroscience

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, but they're
there and they're very popular.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.770 align:middle line:90%
There are journals based on it.

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:30.870 align:middle line:84%
There are centers
at universities now.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So that has
significantly changed.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to see the
change if it's slow.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a 30-year cycling up.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's likely to remain.

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%

change the culture that look

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.630 align:middle line:90%
at it as some problem.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Instead get out
there, like, look,

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
this is scientifically

It's a small effect on average,
some people are talented.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But almost anyone can improve
their abilities to the extent

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that we can develop
this as humanity

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and get more
operational about it.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We could actually shift our
understanding of the future

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and navigate the future
more effectively.
