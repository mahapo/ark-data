00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to have
random visions,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and I could not explain
where they were.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
My mother taught me meditation
since I was 12 years old.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I never took it
seriously, and I was

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
using my mantra and everything
else when I was younger.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
But I never had any visions.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't care less about
the Buddhism part of things.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:90%
That was more part of her life.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I was more drawn towards the
simplicity of my dad's life

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%
in the business world.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It was more pragmatic, and
I was more drawn to that.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:84%
When I was 16 years old, I
was in a boarding school.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
My dad sent me over
there as a punishment,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
because I was kind of failing
my grades in the public system.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
school, I thought

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I could probably put the
transcendental meditations

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:90%
to use.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
I felt compelled

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
that I could do something.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:10%
I felt more powerful that year.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
because I was turning 16,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was more
attracted to girls.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But I felt there was
something changing in me.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.695 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember having,
like, pounding

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
headaches and
nosebleeds that year

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and powerful visions
of people in my class.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
One example was this girl
who was in my Spanish class.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden
during the class,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I saw her on a scooter
leaving the school.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was hit by a car
on the right-hand side.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And she died.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And that shocked me.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.565 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to do with this.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So during the break, I
decided to write down

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:90%
a note explaining the accident.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I was quite goofy about this.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to deal with this.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to let her
know what could happen.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I put it
out in a pen case,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and then when she read it
during the break, she shouted,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
you know, who did this?

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And sheepishly, I said, it's me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And so she just shouted at me.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And the whole event
kind of blew away.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was quickly forgotten.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then a year later, the
accident that I described

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
She was hit by a car exactly
the same location I described.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But the man who hit her was
the Spanish teacher that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
was in the class I was
having the vision in.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And she never died.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the
interpretation of the death

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:90%
was that she turned paraplegic.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So she ended up being
in a wheelchair,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and she never came back
to school after that.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is that I saw this.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I also was able
to use meditations

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to come out of my body and
see objects from a distance.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, I was in
the boarding school, going

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
into the girls' dorm, and
was able to hover over

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the night table of a girl
that I fancied to impress her.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I described three objects
that were on the night table

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that she placed purposely the
same day, because that was

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:90%
the game that we were playing.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I was asking her to place
one object that day,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and she placed three.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back the next
day and I told her what I saw,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
she freaked out.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And she turned all white, pale.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.005 align:middle line:84%
And I basically
lost the opportunity

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:90%
of being her boyfriend that day.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
It carried on for many years
after that to the point

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
where when I first
met my wife at 20,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
she basically said
to me, I don't

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.248 align:middle line:90%
want you to have those visions.

00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want you
to share them with me,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
because you might see me dead
or splitting up or anything

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And I respected that.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And for 10 years, I
decided to shut it down.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I almost imagined, like, some
grid falling all around me

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
like a cage to protect me
from anything that would come.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And that worked for 10 years
until those visions came back

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
in full form.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:52.248 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I started to build up
a life for ourselves.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:10%
In 2005, we started a
business, starting with honey.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And we built a multinational
starting with Canada

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and then moving on
to the US and then

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:90%
England and then New Zealand.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:10%
We branched out to health
food stores, grocery stores,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:10%
pharmacies, and then
working with cancer research

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:10%
institutes.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It was not really thinking of
the consciousness movement.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
My life was just working,
working, working.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a businessman,
and therefore, I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
was very comfortable
in that world.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else mattered to me.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We became the leading
brand of that type of honey

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
in North America very quickly.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, my wife and I decided
to go on holiday to Peru.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we got back
from that holiday,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember basically
having very vivid visions

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that really bothered me.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up at 2
o'clock in the morning

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and writing them down, because
it was so strong and so vivid.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, my
wife just got pregnant.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I not only saw my child
at the age of 20 years

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
old, not knowing the sex
of the baby at the time.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I saw her face.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw her walking
in the corridor.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And she was taller than my wife.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And she had a dimple on
her chin, which is strange

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:90%
because I don't have a dimple.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And my wife doesn't
have a dimple.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I described our
daughter to my wife.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And she just was very
pleased with that,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
because it kind of comforted
her in her first pregnancy.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.165 align:middle line:84%
That was something that
was actually positive.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
More striking to
me was the visions

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I had about those
various events.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them was about the
assassination of a man.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I could see him through
the eyes of someone else.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically on the top
of a rooftop of a building.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
this man in the car.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And the window was rolled down.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:90%
The car wasn't in motion.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was a black car.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And the man had a mustache.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't recognize
him from anywhere.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
while seeing him,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I was having downloads
of information, so

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:90%
impressions of who he was.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And the words were Prime
Minister, assassinated.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.836 align:middle line:84%
These were the two main
words that came to me.

00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:41.691 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that the
man was dead already.

00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:44.637 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So it was not so much
of a vision of someone

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
who was going to
die, but something

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:90%
that already happened.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The next day when I woke up, I
was looking on Google Images,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and "Prime Minister
assassinated"

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:90%
were the keywords.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And the face of
that man showed up.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I could see him there.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.405 align:middle line:90%
It was exactly him.

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And I recognized him.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I told my wife, who
was still in bed.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I was watching it on my laptop.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever
reason, I thought,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.203 align:middle line:90%
let's switch on the television.

00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the first scene that
we saw like the news report

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:84%
was a live report of
the Hague in Europe.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
a tribunal about some

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of the potential killers
of Rafic Hariri, the Prime

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Minister of Lebanon.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a live
report, and they were

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:84%
explaining that two or three men
were brought in for testimony.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But they got released,
and they couldn't

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
hold them responsible for it.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But I had still no idea why
I was seeing those visions

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
about this man who died and
how this will relate to my life

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:90%
or in any shape or form.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I also had visions
of other events

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that happened the same day,
which was the crash of a FedEx

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
airplane, the crash of
another airplane with children

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:90%
inside onboard.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
go to a skiing resort,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and that airplane
really did crash.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I saw those events
the next day in the news.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And those visions changed
my life completely.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
My wife also had
to accept it too,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because I could
not shake them up.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
stayed within me.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
And I could not get rid of them.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
When you think about, again,
the remote viewing program that

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
was created by the Stanford
Research Institute,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA got involved and
created the Stargate program

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The program got
shut down when it

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
became public and got released
in "The New York Times."

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And the government
said, shut it down,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because the money spent in
that was not properly used.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But what most
people don't know is

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that that program, instead
of being shut down,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
got multiplied by like
five times over time.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, there are so many
different factions and groups

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
of remote viewers around
the world that are all

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
linked to that original
program or this target program,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:90%
it's still very much active.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
From 2009 to 2011, I had
a huge amount of visions.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And those visions were becoming
more and more intense in terms

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
of cataclysmic,
seismic activity,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
tsunamis, earthquakes,
fires, you name it.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And this was causing
me grief in a sense

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying to build
up a multinational business.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
bombarded with those visions

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes during the
day, I was in a meeting,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, boom,
those images came to me.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I need to see
someone to help me out

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with those visions because
it's disturbing my life.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
helping me down the road.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.738 align:middle line:84%
So I booked an appointment
with a clinical hypnotherapist.

00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:28.178 align:middle line:90%
[TICKING]

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
One day, I had a
dream about this boy.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And he had big eyes.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
He had high cheekbones,
bright smile.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And he looked like
in his 20s, almost

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
like a surfer dude
from California,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
but not looking so human.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
His eyes were like three
times the size of a human eye.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.875 align:middle line:84%
The face of that boy stayed
with me for the whole day.

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I was looking
through the window.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And there he was.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It was so weird.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I came back home.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to--

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
after supper, I decided
to sit down on my sofa.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I closed
my eyes for a few seconds,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel this
whirlwind around me.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was a weird kind
of energy wind around me.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
boy was standing up right

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had a blue glow
around him, still smiling.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
He was excited to
see me, but I was

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
completely petrified to
the extent physically

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I was not able to move.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%
My hands were glued to the sofa.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
My eyes, as soon
as I opened them,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I could not move
them after that.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't speak.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to me telepathically
and said, my name is Zoar.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm from the Galactic Alliance.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was very strange,
because I never cared about ETs

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.428 align:middle line:90%
before, about UFOs.

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
When he talked to me about
the Galactic Alliance,

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself, I said, I
have no idea what that means.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I had many questions.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason--
and it may sound selfish,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
but I was asking him about the
visions I was having, because I

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
booked this appointment with
a clinical hypnotherapist.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So while waiting for
this appointment,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:90%
he showed up in my life.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
When I asked him about
my visions, I said,

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:90%
you know, I saw people dying.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.697 align:middle line:90%
And we saw things.

00:13:28.697 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, yes, so what?

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Things happen, but our
souls live forever.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
illusion of this world

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:90%
is part of your reality.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And he was so cold
in a way that he

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
was so pragmatic about
things that to me it

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
felt that he wasn't living
on the same reality as ours

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
When he vanished, basically
it was like a blue haze.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It was very shocking to me
that I had this encounter.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my
god, I've lost it.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I was walking
back towards the kitchen,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and I just remember
grabbing my cup of tea,

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.547 align:middle line:84%
not even thinking
or looking at it.

00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was still thinking
about what just happened.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was putting
it towards my lips.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow,
that's freezing cold.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And I put it down.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And right away, I
looked at the stove.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And the time showed that I had
over two hours of missing time.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And the time when I was
talking to this being

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:10%
was maybe like 15
minutes at the most.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:10%
And that was on the
11th of November 2011.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:90%
So 11/11/11.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I never paid attention
to the synchronicities

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
of the dates at that time.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to see
the hypnotherapist,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
our first meeting
was about regression

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and trying to go back to my
past lives as well as my visions

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make
my visions disappear.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But her idea was, well, how
about we make you control them

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:90%
if you want to?

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.472 align:middle line:84%
You can either choose
to control your visions,

00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:90%
or you can make them go away.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, maybe I
should try to control them.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So she taught me how
to do self hypnosis.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And with a tape for like 70
minutes, I was listening to it.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And I could see more
things, like control

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and have visions on demand.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
She was also trying to explore
the facets of my past lives

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.508 align:middle line:84%
and if maybe those visions
had anything to do with that.

00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I could see my life
as an Egyptian.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the sand.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I was outside.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And right next to me on my right
were human-like beings that

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:90%
were at least 14 feet tall.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They had animal heads
or bird's heads.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
people in front of me,

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
looking at those beings

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:90%
being frightened by them.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:10%
And I was next to them
believing that I was

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:10%
their creator, a geneticist.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I could see this
triangular spacecraft that

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:90%
showed up above the pyramid.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And so right away,
I got the impression

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that those creatures next to
me came from ET technology,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:84%
or at least I was
helped to create them

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:90%
from the ET technology.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So the hypnotherapist,
she asked me,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.865 align:middle line:90%
when did these visions start?

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I told her
that when I was younger,

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I used to have random visions.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So the hypnotherapist wants
to go back to that time

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:90%
when I was 16.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
When I closed my
eyes, I was sent back

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to when I was 16 years old.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
I was looking around.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was dark.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the school
grounds of that boarding

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:90%
school in France.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I looked back at my feet,
realized that my feet were

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:90%
leaving the ground.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:90%
So I was being lifted up.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I kept describing it.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm placed on
my back in the air.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I just go feet
first into a spacecraft.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the door
opening on the side.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
It was very bright, and I
was going in feet first.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:84%
As I got into the spacecraft,
I saw those weird, tall, Grey

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:90%
aliens.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had big black
eyes, a slit for a mouth,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and hardly any nose, no
ears, elongated fingers way

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
below their kneecaps,
longer than human arms.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I had some IV drips on
my arms and all that.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really
feeling the pain.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Then the tall, Grey
aliens started to argue.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear them doing
like [LOW MUMBLING] like a very

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.235 align:middle line:90%
deep sound like this.

00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at them,
and they stopped.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
They stopped being
busy around me.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
When that happened,
the hypnotherapist

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:90%
stopped the session on purpose.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:84%
She basically was so
shocked about what

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I was describing that she
was not prepared for this.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were about to talk
about visions, but she said,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.472 align:middle line:84%
I have got zero
clue about aliens.

00:18:15.472 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to deal with this.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
So give me a few weeks.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And then come back, and then
we can start the session again

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
so I can read up about
it so I can ask you

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.583 align:middle line:84%
the right questions at least
help you with the topic.

00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:90%
So I said sure, that's fine.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:90%
So we waited some time.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I came back
for more sessions.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So we repeated
that same session.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was seeing
exactly the same thing--

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
being lifted up, going into the
spacecraft, and then IV drips.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:84%
When the Grey aliens
argued, she asked me,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
so can you ask them what
they are arguing about?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how can I ask them?

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They speak a different
language, you know?

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because in
your subconscious mind,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
you can ask them the question.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And they will be able to
respond to you in English

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:90%
or in French, whatever you want.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked them what
they were arguing about,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
they did respond to
me in English, saying,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
we can't touch you because
you've been tampered with.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
She said, can you then
ask them to show you

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
what they mean by that,
you've been tampered with?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And then a bunch of
symbols showed up

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:90%
in between me and them.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So they were
holographic symbols.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There was an
upside-down triangle

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
with, like, three dots, like
a star shape and like a stick.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
None of that meant
anything to me.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But I was describing it
to the hypnotherapist.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Then she said, well, what
do these symbols mean?

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Grey aliens would
not tell me anything.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The therapist said,
can they then show you

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
where you've seen those symbols
before if they can't tell you

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:90%
what they mean?

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
my whole world

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:84%
changed when I blacked
out under hypnosis.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I was going
backwards very fast.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what was going on.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
opened my eyes under hypnosis.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And I could see my hands.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like,
babylike hands.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I was in a baby body.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel this
black and silky bath

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:90%
that had intelligence to it.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
through the glass

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that there were some shapes
like silhouettes walking around.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I could not quite
tell where it was.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So because of that,
the hypnotherapist then

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
said to me, well, can
you come out of your body

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
to find out where you are?

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I followed exactly
those instructions.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I came out of my body, and I
can see this massive spacecraft

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:90%
that's a few miles long.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know exactly where I
am inside the spacecraft.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I can see the
Earth underneath it.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I could hear the therapist's
voice panicking, saying,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:90%
oh, go back in your body.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And so I went back into my body.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And then she asked
me to come out again

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.256 align:middle line:84%
by saying, stay in
the room so, you know,

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:90%
you can see what's in the room.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a green tinge and
an orange tinge to the walls.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything felt alive.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And everything had an
intelligence to it.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Like the craft itself had life.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The man and a woman were wearing
the upside-down triangle symbol

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.355 align:middle line:84%
that those tall Grey aliens
in that spacecraft showed me.

00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The woman, by the way,
looked very beautiful.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.438 align:middle line:90%
And she had, like, long hair.

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
of, like, Poseidon

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or Zeus or whatever,
these statues,

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:90%
they looked exactly the same.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I remembered how severe and
stern they seemed to me.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It was not like a
loving feeling in a way.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were not experiencing
the human emotions

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:90%
the way we feel them.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It was very different.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
For them, it was very
scientific and to the point.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The man then spoke to me
in a very stern manner

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
again and said to
me, you are supposed

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to be living your life
in a human form and die.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all we're asking of you.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
We live within an illusion.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this reality is
made up for our experiences.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty much what
he was trying to tell me.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.035 align:middle line:84%
You are supposed to
be living your life

00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and then die so we could learn
from these human emotions

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.705 align:middle line:84%
from grief to love to hate,
because those emotions are

00:22:18.705 --> 00:22:19.505 align:middle line:90%
so complex.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I have
learned that those beings

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:90%
were Anunnaki.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So Zoar was my younger brother.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
As an Anunnaki
being, I volunteered

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to be incarnated into
this form as a human body.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Most people are also.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They volunteer their soul
being to create this reality

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.535 align:middle line:90%
so we can have that experience.

00:22:52.535 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So Zoar broke the rules
of the Galactic Alliance

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to come and see me
in my human form.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.860 align:middle line:10%
He said to me, because you
had those experiences now

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:10%
and you are kind of awakened,
you need to go back to Earth

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:10%
and start awakening the
starseeds of this planet.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:10%
These are the words he used.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned that to the
hypnotherapist, and I said,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:10%
that's it.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.358 align:middle line:10%
That's what he told me.

00:23:17.358 --> 00:23:19.613 align:middle line:10%
And he would not
share anything more.

00:23:19.613 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I don't know
what to do with this.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's nice, but I
can't do anything with it.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a guide, a
manual to follow through

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.685 align:middle line:90%
with this request.

00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
When my mother got
pregnant, there

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of mystery
around my birth.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
She got pregnant, and
then she had a hemorrhage,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
went to the hospital to check
if the baby was all right.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they told her
that she was carrying twins

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and that one of the baby
was older than the other,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe like three to four
weeks apart, especially

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
in the southwest of
France in a small town,

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:90%
it's never been seen before.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of an anomaly.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
They told her though,
they said, you

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
know, it's most likely
the first fetus will die,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
because it's not growing.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not developing, which
is exactly what happened.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
She had a miscarriage,
and she ended up just

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:84%
carrying me to term
at nine months.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I was born, the first
layer of my skin fell apart.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was screaming in pain
probably for six months.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was not growing
back by itself.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So my family resorted to the
services of different doctors

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and tried to give me, like,
all sorts of bath solutions.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:90%
But nothing was working.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
When I was six months
old, my skin came back.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And no one knew why and how.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel that when I
was in that spaceship,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
it was so vivid,
so real that I just

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
put the two and two together.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the spaceship,
I was six months old when

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:90%
I saw myself as a baby.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that they
were the ones who healed me

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from this condition
with the black water

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
people call black goo, but
it wasn't black goo to me.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:84%
It felt like healing,
more like fixing my DNA.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.105 align:middle line:84%
To me, it just felt
real, and it just

00:25:09.105 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
gave me the answers
for something

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that was a big
anomaly and missing

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
link for my own
family back in France.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
the human reality,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
collective consciousness.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a made-up reality that
has been designed for us so we

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
can have all those experiences
and then die and then move on.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:10%
But the Hopi Indians and various
cultures around the world

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:10%
have those prophecies, like
the rainbow prophecies,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:10%
for example, with
the Hopi Indians.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:10%
They talk about a time when all
the cultures around the world

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:10%
will gather around a circle
and recreate a new reality

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:10%
for themselves where the trees
can grow back overnight--

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:10%
overnight from seeds.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting about all
the First Nations-- and I

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:10%
was fortunate enough to
work with a few of them

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:10%
where I live right now in
Vancouver Island, Canada.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them,
where do you come from,

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
where does your culture,
your nation comes from,

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
they said, well, our
ancestors fell from the sky.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't call them ETs.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They say, they are
our star brothers.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
different from that.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We just forgot
where we come from.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
What the Anunnaki
shared with me was

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.602 align:middle line:84%
that we are the last form
of evolution on the planet.

00:26:30.602 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the last
time they will try

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the human
genome, because we

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
are the perfect example of
how we can evolve already

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
using the tools combining
the energetic world

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
with the physical world.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can combine that to make
up a new reality for ourselves.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what the Hopi
Indians talk about.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:84%
They say, we can recreate
reality overnight,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is in our power
if we just put all of our minds

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Mind over matter
is a real thing.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
This is demonstrated
in schools today

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
when they can put plants,
like two different plants.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And by interjecting some
negativity towards one plants

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and love and
kindness to another,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the one that has all
the negative emotions

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:84%
will die way sooner
than a plant that has

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:90%
all these positive energies.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:90%
So mind can in fact matter.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.233 align:middle line:84%
This can also be impacted
from any location.

00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
You can do the
same thing remotely

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:90%
from like 5,000 miles away.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
That's when we can see that time
and space is just an illusion.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.805 align:middle line:90%
It's got no real boundaries.

00:27:33.805 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.015 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, the
more and more people

00:27:48.015 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved
with have been

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
confirming what I've
been going through,

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:90%
what I've lived through.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
When Zoar showed up
in my living room

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and started telling me that
he was part of the Galactic

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Alliance, this meant
absolutely nothing to me.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But I came to realize
that the Alliance was

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of group of ETs that
were working with one another.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The human genome--
we have our DNA.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:84%
We have all these components
and branches of our DNA

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that are from
different ET races.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Like a recipe
basically would have,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for me, like
75% Anunnaki, 5% Draco, 5%

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Andromedan, whatever it is.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
recipe for each.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So when people today will say,
I feel like I'm Andromedan,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel I'm Pleiadian,
I feel like I'm Draco,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I feel I'm this
or that, they have

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
a sentiment they feel
attracted to those beings.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is probably true.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:10%
But they also ignore
the fact that they

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:10%
are way more complex than
what they seem to be.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:10%
All of these beings are
working with one another.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
The Draco used to be part of
the human genome program, which

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is why we have the
reptilian brain,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
connecting energy.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:84%
All of that is
affiliated with them.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's not all negative.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:84%
There are some positive
components to these beings.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
because of their agenda

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and being as greedy
as they are and not

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.280 align:middle line:84%
wanting to play
by the rules, they

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
got ejected from that
Galactic Alliance.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The duality in terms of negative
and positive is very real.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And certain factions,
certain forces, ETs,

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.190 align:middle line:84%
would prefer to work towards
darkness because it gives them

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
extra power.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
today on planet Earth.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Those inferences exist as much
as the positive inferences.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have access
to both ET groups

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
on the planet who are
currently controlling us.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They are the Illuminati groups
and the secret societies

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:84%
are working with the
Draco reptilians.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know that from people
who are within those groups.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The Secret Space Program
faces that daily.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, this explains
why there are so

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
many powerful factions
between the CIA,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the SSP, and the cabal groups
that basically are fighting

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:90%
one another on a regular basis.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:10%
I have worked with
people who told me

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.980 align:middle line:10%
that they went on
missions through the SSP,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:10%
and they have met the Dracos.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:84%
They have seen humans
in cages and children

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that some were used
to be fed to the Draco

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:90%
as a delicacy, some for slaves.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They are currently working
towards a program that's

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
called the immortals when they
want to leave forever, right?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those things
that they work towards.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
people in government who

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:90%
are using those dark energies.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
The people from the SSP that
went on to fight those groups--

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I know people within the
Secret Space Program that got

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
killed that never came
back from those missions.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The way I can do remote
viewing, seeing events

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in other locations,
doing remote influencing,

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:84%
influencing people from a
distance-- all of these things

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:90%
are humanly possible.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can do this.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Some can do it with training.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of remote viewers out
there do it with training.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I do have limits
like anybody else.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember
where I come from.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.125 align:middle line:84%
I've gone back to the source
of the origin of life.

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled
through the cosmos.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.042 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled through
the multiverse.

00:31:36.042 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make me a better man.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make me
feel like I'm above.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm just still a human
being with an experience.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that my role
and my small little role

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
in doing this and achieving
this is by following

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.975 align:middle line:90%
the agenda of disclosure.

00:31:51.975 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
People should realize that they
are way more powerful than they

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
To regain control of their
lives, of their solar origin,

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
remembering who they
are as sovereign beings,

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're not just puppets
of the government and society.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:84%
We are enlightened
beings already.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
remember who we are.
