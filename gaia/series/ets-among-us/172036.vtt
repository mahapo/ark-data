of unidentified flying objects

by Wernher Von Braun,

the top German rocket scientist
who was brought to the United

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
States right after World War II
to make sure that his knowledge

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880 align:middle line:84%
didn't get into the
hands of the Soviets.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:10%
And he said, first it's
going to be the communists,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:10%
then it's going to
be the terrorists,

be extraterrestrials.

Well, this is what's happening.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.908 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no question
there's a government cover-up.

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:10%
The question, of course, is why?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:10%
When I worked here at the Hayden
Planetarium, like 30 years ago,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:10%
I worked with a brilliant
woman named Dr. Margaret Mead.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that 30
years before that, she

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
was part of a government
NASA study formed

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
when NASA was formed
that basically said,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
if we find evidence
of aliens out there,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell the
American people,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because civilization
will be destroyed.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It's too bad I didn't
know then what I know now.

>> About 90% of the human beings
on this planet are asleep.

They have no idea what's
going on in the real world.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They live in a little
illusional world of their own.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
story in human history

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
is unfolding around them,
and they haven't a clue.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:10%

They distort the lens.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:10%
They do it through
various techniques--

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:10%
certainly propaganda
is well-known--

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:10%
where they put out direct
false information in the media

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:10%
and what have you to give a
false perception of events,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:10%
of history, of what's going on,
thus corrupting the worldview

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.104 align:middle line:10%
of their citizens.

00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The UFO ET issue is,
in fact, an example.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The cover-up
worked like this.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:10%
We consistently
downplay the true extent

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:10%
of both our interest
in and involvement

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:10%
with this phenomenon.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And we routinely told British
Parliament, the media,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and the public that UFOs were
of no defense significance

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
when, all the while,
behind closed doors,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
we were looking at
this very seriously.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm curious,
like everybody else.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:10%
The truth needs to come out.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:10%
If there is really
visitation to Earth

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:10%
and there are cosmic
cultures coming here,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm just
the spokesperson

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:10%
for the average
intelligent human being.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the cases that
we featured in our book,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:10%
in "Wonders in the Sky", is an
observation by Michelangelo,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:10%
who saw what he called a
luminous sign of three luminous

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:10%
objects in the sky that he
saw long enough that he could

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.205 align:middle line:10%
remember them very clearly.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And he painted a
painting of them.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is really true,
if we're having visitations--

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're not only now, they
happened in ancient times.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've had some proof
that in ancient times,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
visitors from ancient
cultures have come here--

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:90%
then let's face it.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.838 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
rewrite all of our history.

>> In 1947, after the UFO
crash in Roswell, New Mexico,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:10%
President Truman assigned 12
men to study and classify all

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:10%
of the information about
UFOs, and above all,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:10%
to keep it hidden from
the American people.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
This secret group,
called Majestic 12,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
had a conflict with one of
their members, Secretary

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of Defense James Forrestal.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to reveal the
truth to the American public.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:10%
Instead, he was admitted to
the Bethesda Naval Hospital

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:10%
where he fell from a
high window to his death.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they claimed
it was a suicide.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Today, almost 60 years later,
all of the original Majestic 12

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
members are dead, and 12 new
members have taken their place.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But do you, the average
person, know about any of this?

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I know--

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.913 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to say I believe--

00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:10%
I know that we have
objects that are reported

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:10%
as unidentified flying
objects, UFOs, that did not

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:10%
originate on this planet.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
They are under
intelligent control,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and they come from
some other planet

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.779 align:middle line:90%
from some other solar system.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:10%

US government might have wanted

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:10%
to keep the aliens
secret, as it were,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:10%
away from public knowledge,
50 or 60 years ago.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Just after the crash
at Roswell in 1947,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:90%
which is where it all started--

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't the first
crash, but the one

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:90%
that got people interested--

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
the world was
different at that time.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:90%
It was just after World War II.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
People were tired of
war, and they probably

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.370 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have wanted
to know that we

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
were being visited by people
from outside of our planet.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Make no mistake about it.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Technology acquisition lies
at the heart of UFO secrecy,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
lies at the heart of
government policy on this,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the United
Kingdom, and I'm sure, too,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, in Russia,
in China, all around the world.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:10%
>> There's an organization
that was formed after the Paris

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:10%
Peace Conference after World War
I called the Council on Foreign

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:10%
Relations.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I view as
the US branch of the world

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:10%
They control all
the major media.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And you can't get nominated to
be president of United States,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:10%
whether it's Democrat
or Republican,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:10%
without being approved by the
Council on Foreign Relations.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
They have grooming
programs, Rhodes scholars,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Fulbright scholars.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Skull and Bones
even are grooming

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:90%
people for world service.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you get elected
president, you wear two hats.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You wear a US hat, and you
wear a world government hat.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So the alien issue is
something that the president is

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:90%
briefed on after he's elected.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Before he takes office,
he's briefed on again,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
after he takes office.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Bill Casey gave Reagan
a one-hour briefing

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:90%
in late January, '81.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And then Reagan got an
all-day briefing by Bill Casey

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:10%
in March of '81.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That same thing happens to
all presidents now, I think.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
He's given enough
information for him

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to absorb, to realize
why it's so important not

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to have disclosure or too much
disclosure before it's time.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Now I know that the
government has plans that when

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:10%
the common enemy is
no longer communism--

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:10%
and then it became
international terrorism.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
And when that doesn't
hold up anymore,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.503 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to be
a threat from space.

00:08:37.503 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are you going
to make people believe

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
there's a threat
from space if nobody

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
believes there's anything
intelligent in outer space?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So now we're being
conditioned to the idea

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that there really
is something there.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see
these incremental stories

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and releases of
information in the media--

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
things flying over New
York, things flying

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:90%
over Stephenville, Texas.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawkins comes out and
says, yeah, there's probably

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:90%
intelligent life out there.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
NASA has incrementally
told us the moon

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:90%
is a dead, airless planet.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little
bit of an atmosphere.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait a minute.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:90%
It's got a little bit of water.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why this idea
of maybe just drip-feeding

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the information out there, and
surrounding it sometimes with

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of "X Files" music,
a little bit of jokes about

little green men
in tinfoil hats,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
best way to do it.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Government is not averse
to spin and dirty tricks.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:10%
>> We know in 1977 that the
United States Congressional

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:10%
Research Service was tasked
by the Science and Technology

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:10%
Committee of the United States
Congress to undertake a major

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:10%
investigation of the issue of
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:10%
and the issue of
the UFO phenomenon.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:84%
This was undertaken
directly at the request

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:90%
of President Carter.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And that United States
government investigation

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
concluded that there
were at least from two

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to six highly
technologically developed,

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
intelligent civilizations
inside our own galaxy

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.827 align:middle line:84%
over and above
that of our Earth.

00:10:10.827 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's an official finding
of the United States government

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.824 align:middle line:90%
in 1977.

00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It was submitted to the
United States Congress

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and to the office of President
of the United States.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> 99.9% of this country is
completely out of the loop

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and oblivious to
what is going on.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:84%
There are approximately 129,
130 known underground facilities

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The people that are involved
in building these things

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and running them and
utilizing these facilities

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
appear to be operating
outside the Constitution.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And if they're getting away
with this, who knows what

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:90%
else they could get away with?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I had met with Edgar
Mitchell, Apollo 14.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:10%
And basically, Edgar Mitchell
made a very powerful statement

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:10%
as to the fact that
Roswell was real,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:10%
that he had called the Pentagon,
that his Pentagon source said

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:10%
Roswell was real, that
this subject matter is

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:10%
highly classified, that he can't
even get to the truth of it.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:10%
Most presidents can't
get to the truth of it.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
If I don't believe
Edgar Mitchell, who's

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
an astronaut, if I don't believe
Colonel Phillip Corso, who

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
worked in the Pentagon
in back-engineering alien

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
technology, then
who do we believe?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up with astronauts--

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Gus Grissom, Gordon
Cooper, John Glenn.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I have two godfathers who
have walked on the moon.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
My brother's godfather
is Gene Cernan,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.815 align:middle line:90%
who also walked on the moon.

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have astronauts
all through our family.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, Gordon
Cooper and Gus Grissom

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:10%
were the two who first talked
about how they'd see UFOs

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.525 align:middle line:10%
outside the spacecraft.

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And they could see
through the windows.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And they would bring home film
in these little Bell & Howell

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.954 align:middle line:84%
8mm cameras with the little
wind-up doohickeys on them

00:11:49.954 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that they would take from space
and show these craft that were

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.494 align:middle line:90%
flying around the capsules.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.511 align:middle line:84%
>> There's not much question
at all that there's life

00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.302 align:middle line:90%

>> They do know one thing--

00:13:31.454 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:10%
there will be
people who will take

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:10%
their own lives
because they will not

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:10%
be able to cope with it.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:10%
I can tell you from
being in the military,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:10%
and I can tell you from the
perspective of the recovery

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:10%
teams, there have
been people that

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:10%
were in the military that
wasn't ready to accept that.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
took their lives.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> There had been a scare.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Orson Welles put had put a
show, a radio show one Halloween

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
night based on H.G.
Wells' "War of the Worlds"

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
with the martians
invading Syracuse.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And it really created a panic.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:10%
So there was this fear, I guess.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, if people know
what's going on,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:10%
they will react in
an unpredictable way.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I know of one incident where
a person took an M-16 and blew

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the top of his head off simply
because he couldn't cope with

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
the fact that he knew he came
into something that was not

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of this world, that it didn't
originate on this planet.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:90%
He was very religious.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to put it--
like an assault on everything

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.374 align:middle line:84%
he believed, everything
that he held as being true.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The Roswell crash in July of
1947 has now been established

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:90%
to have been an historical fact.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we were able to
recover the photographs

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that were taken of General
Ramey in July of 1947,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
which he was displaying the
false wreckage of a weather

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:90%
balloon.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.485 align:middle line:84%
And in his hand,
he had the telegram

00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:90%
he had received from Washington.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And it said directly
in the telegram,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:10%
when we digitized the
negatives and blew them up,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:10%
it says bring the bodies
from the crash site

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:10%
to Wright-Patternson in Ohio.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that's
an historical fact.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I had an acquaintance,
Lieutenant Colonel Phillip

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:10%
Corso, who was the head of the
Foreign Technology Division

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:10%
at the Pentagon for the Army.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:10%
And he stated in his book,
"The Day After Roswell,"

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:10%
that an alien spaceship
crashed in the desert in 1947

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico, and that he had
the debris from this crash.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
And he gave pieces of it
to various laboratories

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:90%
and research institutes.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:10%
And they came up with
lasers, fiber optics,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:10%
and integrated computer chips.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:10%
He also claimed that he had
seen a humanoid type alien.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that
people don't realize

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that the advances in technology
over the last 50 years

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
are due to the crash of an
alien spaceship in 1947.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that Colonel
Corso fed this data out

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to the giants of
American industry,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and today our world has changed.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
We've had advances in the
last 50 years in technology

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
greater than in the last couple
of thousand years of history.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, just the
beginning of the Cold War,

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
the Americans were just
absolutely petrified that

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
the Russians might get access
to the same technology.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I was 16 years old and
saw seven red light-type UFOs

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:10%
flying around over Washington,
DC, 26th July, 1952.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
It made headlines
around the world.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:84%
That was the second Saturday
night in a row that alien

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
vehicles put on a demonstration
to the extent that the media

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
cannot ignore it and the
government couldn't cover it

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> With regard to the Project
Blue Book study that was

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
undertaken by the United
States Air Force of the UFO

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, we know perfectly
well that that classified

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
report has sections in it
that have never been revealed

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.955 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:18:36.955 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:10%
And so while they
were attempting

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:10%
to debunk the
phenomenon, I've actually

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:10%
gotten to see sections of the
classified photographs that

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:10%
show a crashed
disc on the ground

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:10%
with foreign symbols on it
that were of no civilization

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:10%
here on this planet,
and the people

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:10%
surrounding it taking
pictures of the disc

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:10%
crashed on the ground.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:10%
And we know that that was,
in fact, a genuine disc

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:10%
that was on the ground.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:10%
So even though the
whole project was

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:10%
designed to debunk
the UFO phenomenon,

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:10%
it, in fact, has
verified the fact

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:10%
that there is such a real
historical phenomenon

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:10%
as these flying saucers.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'm investigating are
cases where the craft lands,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
the occupants get out, they
interact with the witnesses,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they produce phenomena.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.596 align:middle line:84%
They are wearing different
garments and different clothes.

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Their skin color is different.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And they get back in
the ship and fly away.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:10%
Those are not
piezoelectric phenomena,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:10%
or mental aberrations,
or anything else.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:10%
That really happened.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And it happens over
and over again,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
you have more and more
witnesses verifying the ones

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
before until you have a body of
evidence that is indisputable.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Yet somebody will come
along and say, oh, it's

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
all something that
they dreamed, and they

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
think it's reality, when
that's not the case at all.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We have absolute, solid
reality going on here.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most
incredible videos that shows

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:10%
intelligently-controlled craft
moving in our upper atmosphere

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:10%
was taken by NASA's own cameras.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
This is STS114, taken in August,
2005 from a routine shuttle

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
mission looking
down at the Earth.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:84%
We have a night view-- the
camera on the space shuttle,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts tucked into
their space beds-- sleeping,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, while the
ever-present camera peers

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
into the murkiness of space.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, this light
appears out of nowhere

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and moves in a straight line
towards the edge of the Earth,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:90%
towards the limb of the Earth.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.785 align:middle line:84%
Now, as it approaches the edge
there, it seems to slow down.

00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's really going
on-- it's just moving away

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
from the camera,
and it's getting

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:90%
further and further away.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And just as it
goes out of sight,

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
this massive,
luminous object comes

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:90%
flying from the other direction.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a diameter of miles

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to be throwing off
that much light.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It slows down and comes
to a complete stop.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And just as it comes to
a stop, another object

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
appears and moves off in
yet another direction.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And then something
truly amazing happens.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
That huge, luminous object
starts going backwards.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It retraces its steps--

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
again, something
that could only be

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.020 align:middle line:90%
a sign of intelligent control.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The evidence contained
in this video

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
should be the subject of a major
international press conference.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
But instead, what does NASA do?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:90%
They turn their cameras away.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
The most extraordinary discovery
in the history of humanity

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.945 align:middle line:90%
they want to keep secret.

00:21:40.945 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want us to know
our true place in the universe.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But now we've see ,
beyond a reasonable doubt,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:84%
the reality that's unfolding
above our heads day in and day

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:10%
>> In this small Greek
village of Atalanti,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary
UFO event occurred,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:10%
quite similar in some ways
to our American Roswell,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico event of 1947.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the Roswell
case, the government

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
swooped in and confiscated every
single little piece of debris

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
they could find, hoping
to eradicate all evidence

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that an extraterrestrial
craft had been there

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:10%
>> In Greece, we have many
impressive events that were

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:10%
reported on the front
page of the newspapers--

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:10%
for example, the
case of the 10 or 15

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:10%
spacecrafts that flew
around Greece several times

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:10%
and disappeared in the Balkans.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:10%
These are common events,
and we have many of them.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.995 align:middle line:10%
One such impressive event
occurred in Atalanti,

00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:10%
in Central Greece, in the
year 1990 on September 2nd.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:10%
There was a separate formation
of 13 to 15 flying objects.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:10%
The spacecrafts were
very bright in the sky.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:10%
They arrived early
in the afternoon

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:06.156 align:middle line:10%
and flew over the area
two or three times

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:10%
until around 1:00 in the
morning when one of them

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:10%
seemed to be damaged.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:10%
The damaged craft was
surrounded by all the others

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:10%
as if they were
trying to protect it.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:10%
They descended and hovered
close to the ground,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:10%
looking for a place to land.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:10%
Finally, they landed in
the small town of Atalanti.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:10%
After landing, some
small, nervous beings

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:10%
emerged from the spacecraft.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Each spacecraft seemed
to have only one being.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:10%
They quickly ran and
extinguished the fire

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.715 align:middle line:10%
with some kind of
handheld mechanism.

00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:10%
It seemed that they did
some repairs on this craft.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:10%
And around 5:00 in the
morning, all of them flew away.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:10%
There were some witnesses,
some shepherds in the distance.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:10%
And they reported to us.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:10%
The next day, the
event was verified

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:10%
by people in nearby
villages who saw the lights

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:10%
of the craft all night long.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people went
to the landing site,

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and they collected many
objects left behind.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:10%
Later on, the staff
from the Air Force

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:10%
came over and took the
objects from the police.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:10%
And they sent all these
objects to Washington.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>> It becomes a national
security problem of great

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:10%
importance when it involves--

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:10%
when this phenomenon
involves unique technology,

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:10%
unique to our society and time.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is experiencing
the same kind of phenomena.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They're not just visiting
one country or one place.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's happening all
over the world.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And every place
where it happens,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:84%
they retain the best evidence
for their own information,

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
but always thinking that they've
got a piece of the puzzle.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.325 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to give that piece

00:24:55.325 --> 00:24:56.825 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else
that might complete

00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:90%
his puzzle before theirs.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So everybody holds all
the pieces to their chest,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't release any
information, hopes

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to get information that others
have without giving anything

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:90%
in return.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, it becomes
a national security problem,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
because it always
represents the potential

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:84%
for a technological breakthrough
that would give us an adventure

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:84%
or give an enemy an advantage
over all the rest of the world.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.005 align:middle line:84%
And so in that sense, it's
a serious national security

00:25:23.005 --> 00:25:23.805 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that now.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.425 align:middle line:84%
I understand why
they're doing it.

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What the hell is that?

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:10%
>> It takes a lot less testimony
to bring a case in court than

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:10%
it has taken for
this UFO phenomenon.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You can actually prosecute
people on a lot less testimony

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
than we have.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The chairman and several
other board members of all

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:10%
of the major media in the
United States are members

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Council on
Foreign Relations.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:10%
That's why UFO stories can
meet the public eye locally,

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:10%
but they don't
spread nationally.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
They can't put that
kind of information

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
about the alien presence
into the public domain--

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that is where the general
population reads it,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:90%
like on ABC--

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
unless they have a debunker
to give those who aren't ready

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
for that kind of information,
that aren't ready for aliens--

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
which is probably a majority
of the people on the planet--

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
an excuse not to believe, not to
make it part of their reality.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:10%
You'll notice that
Larry King, who

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:10%
also is a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have someone
with a really good story

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:10%
without having somebody
from [INAUDIBLE] on there

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:10%
to embarrass himself.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they must pay
these guys really well

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:10%
to embarrass themselves
on those programs that

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:10%
require a debunker.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We have such an enormous
amount of evidence that aliens

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:84%
are visiting here, even
if they're not landing

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:90%
on the White House lawn.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Why should they?

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The president doesn't speak for
6.7 or so billion earthlings.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a crazy, convoluted notion.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I get other people saying,
well, if they were coming here,

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
they would have
sent a signal first.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Sure, like Columbus sent
smoke signals to the Natives

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:90%
before he went west.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:90%
That's absurd.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:90%
We have data.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They have none except
wishful thinking.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Henry Kissinger, Nelson
Rockefeller, David Rockefeller,

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:10%
in all of these interests, set
up a virtual disinformation

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:10%
system which discredited
all contactees,

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:10%
all public contact with
benevolent extraterrestrial

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:10%
civilizations, which ridiculed
all of the citizenry,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and then which, in essence,
privatized the contact with

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial civilizations
and started an undeclared war

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:10%
against them in order to
capture the technology.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:10%
>> The STS 48 video is one
of the most remarkable pieces

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:10%
of UFO footage that we have,
not only because it shows a near

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:10%
Earth object under intelligent
control being shot at, but it

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:10%
was also taken by
NASA's own cameras.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:84%
An orbiting space shuttle
captured this footage

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
of this object, which seems
to be under its own control,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
moving along at a
very deliberate pace.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It heads in a
northern direction.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
there's a flash of light.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We think that this
flash of light

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:84%
was the defense system of star
war satellites, a rocket being

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.580 align:middle line:84%
launched either from
an orbiting satellite

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:90%
or from a ground base station.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
This object anticipates this
and flies off into outer space.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the rocket
shooting straight up.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.755 align:middle line:84%
When this footage was
recorded, NASA used to stream

00:28:52.755 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
live their footage from the
orbiting space shuttles.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.476 align:middle line:84%
Now all of their
video is on delay.

00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There were two
Cape Canaveral.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:10%
There was Cape Canaveral, which
was the NASA Cape Canaveral,

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.018 align:middle line:10%
and then there was the
military Cape Canaveral,

00:29:05.018 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:10%
which was like a gleaming
city next to the NASA

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.720 align:middle line:10%
one in Florida.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But you never had access
to the military base.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
we're shooting guys

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:90%
up in bottle rockets.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They're using electromagnetics
and anti-gravity

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and anti-matter
and all the things

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.110 align:middle line:84%
we either got from the
Roswell crash in 1947

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
or got from the Germans in
the 1930s and the 1940s.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1989, I learned I had had
alien abduction experiences,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:10%
and prior to that was
very skeptical about it.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.570 align:middle line:10%
But ended up going on a trip
to Rachel, Nevada, to Area 51,

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:10%
and having a series
of sightings.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:10%
And I went from
being very skeptical

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:10%
about the subject of UFOs to
saying, OK, I'm seeing them.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.230 align:middle line:10%
They exist.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:59.122 align:middle line:10%
They're flying in and out of a
known top secret military base.

00:29:59.122 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And the government is
obviously lying about it,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
because they see them flying
out here in and out of the space

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, three
major belief systems

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:90%
shifted for me overnight.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
UFOs exist, the
government knows about it,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and the government
is lying about it.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The secret is self-keeping
in that no nation on the face

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth could do it.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:10%
If people would open their
eyes and go ahead and open

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:10%
their minds and accept the
fact that people are seeing

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:10%
something in the
skies that appear

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:10%
to be under intelligent
control, exhibiting a technology

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:10%
that we are totally
incapable of--

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:10%
actually, the technology
would be in the realm of magic

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:10%
to most of us.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
But it is a technology.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't stress that enough.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.549 align:middle line:10%
While you and I might say we are
ready to accept the government

00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:10%
coming out and saying
that we have visitors

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:10%
from other planets,
NASA went ahead

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:10%
and stated we can't
really be sure how

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:10%
the population of
the world is going

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:10%
to react when we state
that we have discovered

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial intelligence
out there in the cosmos,

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:10%
let alone that that intelligence
is already among us.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Nine saucers landed
in this guy's yard.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And these humanoid
aliens got out

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:10%
and talked to the
people who lived there.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Aliens have been a
prime suspect in the cattle

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:90%
mutilation phenomenon.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:90%
The blood's removed.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.125 align:middle line:90%
The rectum's cored out.

00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
The sex organs are
missing, having

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
been done with incredible
surgical precision.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that they are here
because they have a scientific

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.317 align:middle line:84%
interest in us and maybe a
scientific interest in some

00:31:37.317 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
of the things we're doing.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was 15, I was away
at school in Rhode Island.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And I was studying physics
and mathematics, primarily.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was in high
school, I had a college regime.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had won awards for
designing particle accelerators

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and doing some other interesting
things, plasma research

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I went home with a
fella and his family,

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and spending the weekend
with them one time.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted to go
off shopping somewhere,

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:10%
and I just refused to go.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I went on a hike.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was out in the woods.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
fall, probably October.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I encountered this fellow
coming out of the woods

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:90%
with a shotgun.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was very interested
in guns in those days.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.566 align:middle line:84%
And so we struck
up a conversation.

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me
all about this shotgun.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.246 align:middle line:10%
He asked me if I'd like
to shoot it, which I did.

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And then out of the
clear blue sky, he says,

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
we've been watching
you for a long time.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So I looked around, and I said,
you have some friends with you?

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, he says.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I mean.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm from Venus.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.139 align:middle line:84%
So having grown
up in Jersey City,

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:44.555 align:middle line:84%
I was street smart
at a young age.

00:32:44.555 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:84%
There was all sorts
of nuts loose.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I was
with one of them.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And he had the
gun, and I didn't.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:90%
So I figured I'd humor him.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:90%
So tell me about Venus.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And this guy
proceeded to tell me

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of incredible
things about Venus--

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
surface temperature was
such and such too hot,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and this and that, and all of
the dwellings were underground.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And he rambled on
for quite some time.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:10%
At one point, he says, well,
we know where you go to school,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:10%
and you're doing some
interesting things.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, really?

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was very surprised.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
He did know the
town that I went to,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and he did know the
school that I went to,

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:90%
which was a little unnerving.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:84%
He said something about he was
appointed to monitor my case.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And strangely enough,
that's about all I

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.510 align:middle line:84%
remember of my
conversation with this guy.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:10%
And I walked back to
the home with the people

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:10%
I was staying with.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And their car was back, so I
figured, good, they're home.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I rang the doorbell.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The woman came to
the door, and she was

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.599 align:middle line:90%
in a state of near hysteria.

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what do
you mean, why are you

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.942 align:middle line:90%
doing this, et cetera.

00:33:57.942 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, you've
been gone all day.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you've
got to be kidding.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:90%
No, no, she said.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
We have the police out looking
for you and everything.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that I had gone
for that walk around 10:00

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and it must
have been about 3:00 or 4:00

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
when I got back.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very interesting
lost time episode

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:90%
which I have no explanation for.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I was working in Connecticut
for a small company that was

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:90%
building electric cars.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had hired
me as a director

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:90%
of research and development.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.638 align:middle line:84%
The problem that I
was given at the time

00:34:28.638 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
was the development of a
new type of transmission

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:90%
for this vehicle.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:10%
And it was a very
difficult thing

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:10%
to design because they
wanted some pretty

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:10%
unusual performances.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And this problem vexed me.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It was on my mind
for day and night.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
And this one
particular day, I was

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
working with drawings and
a calculator and whatnot

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.371 align:middle line:90%
till about 3:00 in the morning.

00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I had really
exhausted myself.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to quit, took a
shower, got ready to go to bed,

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:90%
got in.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was running my fingers
through my dog's hair,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
who was curled up at
the side of the bed.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was just in
that twilight zone

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:90%
between wakeness and sleep.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
instantaneously, I

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:84%
was propelled to this other
area, this other place.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a very arid region.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I was in a canyon,
a rocky canyon.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And directly ahead of me
was a trapezoidial door

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that had been cut into the
rock, above which was engraved

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:90%
some type of hieroglyphics.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was compelled to
walk through this portal.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into this
dark, dank hallway that

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:90%
had been cut out of the rock.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And immediately I could hear
the sounds of heavy machinery.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I followed this to the
end, and it opened up

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:84%
into a vast canyon, a cavern
that had been carved out.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:10%
And in that space were
two gigantic machines

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:10%
that were oscillating
or spinning

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:10%
in a very peculiar fashion.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
The best description
I can give you

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
something like gyroscopes.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And my instinct at
that time was that they

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
were used to create power
for this installation.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea where I was or
what this installation was for.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But after I studied the
machines for a few minutes,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I crossed the
causeway, went over

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
to the other side
of this huge cavern,

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and went down a flight of stairs
into this very brilliantly-lit

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And this room was set up very
much like a surgical arena.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
There were operating tables and
all sorts of unusual equipment.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the walls,
there were cages

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
embedded in the wall with
steel bars in front of them.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.852 align:middle line:84%
And behind these bars were
some real unusual creatures.

00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The best description
I can give you

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
is that they were something like
creatures from Greek mythology.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:84%
There were half one
species and half another,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't dwell there very long.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I woke up or snapped back,
whatever you want to call it.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And my first instinct was
to draw these machines

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.366 align:middle line:90%
before I forgot them.

00:37:10.366 --> 00:37:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I just slipped into
a pair of slippers,

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:84%
ran to the drafting table,
and I drew up those machines.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, I've
built several of these devices.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're extremely
complicated.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.506 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
how they work yet.

00:37:23.506 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But I've been analyzing
them for years.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I still think they are
a form of power source.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The would-be leaders and
rulers of this world owe

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:10%
their power to their monopolies
over energy, transportation,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:10%
pharmaceuticals,
medicine, et cetera.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They realize that
if we understand

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that there are alternative
species in the universe,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.710 align:middle line:84%
then there are alternative
energy sources,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:90%
transportation sources.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And it might upset
their monopolies.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe there are 57
or more different species

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial life
visiting our planet at this

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.930 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I base this on a book that I
saw while I was in the military.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The necessity of that
book was to give us

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
some knowledge of
first aid that we

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:84%
could render to whatever species
we might come in contact to as

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
a result of a crash.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
There where times when
we'd go to crash sites,

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.500 align:middle line:84%
we would have seven
that were injured.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, what they
called an interfacer, which

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
is what I was a
part of, they would

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
have to communicate
to the other people

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
there as to what the injuries
was and what type of steps

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:90%
they would have to take.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't verbalize
what they were feeling.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:90%
It was like mental telepathy.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like you were
picking it up in your mind.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But you could hear them like
if you and I were talking.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.314 align:middle line:84%
You would have a tendency
to move your lips.

00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't have to, because
they could pick up on what

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:90%
you were thinking at that time.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a thought
transfer process.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I heard this roaring
sound in my head.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:10%
An electrical feeling
started from my head

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:10%
going down my body.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:90%
My body felt almost weightless.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I actually felt as if
my body floated up off the bed.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:10%
>> They'd come into the room,
these gray aliens with large

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.570 align:middle line:10%
heads and big black eyes.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.524 align:middle line:84%
>> But they were little
men with no hair.

00:39:22.524 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And they came right
through my bedroom window.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The abduction phenomenon
occupies most of my time now.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:middle line:10%
This is a situation
in which people

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.930 align:middle line:10%
think that they have
been abducted by aliens

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:10%
who are inside the UFOs.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened to
them, oftentimes, many times.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they come to me to
see exactly what happened

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to them because they only
have very short memories,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:84%
little snippets of memories,
and sometimes very few memories.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But very odd things
have happened to them

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> They all looked alike.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:84%
They had big, black eyes,
two little holes for a nose,

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.006 align:middle line:84%
no discernible mouth,
no hair, no ears.

00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Then they'd take me out.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And if I passed through
a wall or a window,

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:10%
it feels that I am passing
through mud or hard jello.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember it being
floated out the same window.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
As strange as this
sounds, if felt like going

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:90%
through very firm jello.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:10%
>> These entities have
the ability to go ahead,

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:10%
go through solid objects.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:10%
They could appear,
disappear, things that

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:10%
would appear to be magic to us.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:90%
But it's not magic.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
It's technology that's
not hundreds of years,

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:84%
but thousands of years
ahead of where we're at.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember looking down
and seeing the treetops

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:84%
in my backyard and the the
roof of my house and then going

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:90%
straight up.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a big roundtable,
and there's a bunch of them

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:90%
moving about.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> They were somewhere between
four and five feet tall.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember them performing
medical exams on me.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> They're taking
scrapings of skin.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:10%
They're inserting things
gynecologically into me,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.930 align:middle line:10%
taking things
gynecologically from me.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I recall lying flat on
my back and being examined

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
by chalky-colored
alien creatures.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:10%
>> I felt so horribly violated.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a lab rat.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:22.107 align:middle line:84%
They pulled my rear end back
and spread my legs apart.

00:41:22.107 --> 00:41:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what was going
to happen at that point.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.226 align:middle line:84%
It was like suddenly like--
it felt like an air gun,

00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
like a bullet hit
the top of my uterus.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:29.891 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what they did.

00:41:29.891 --> 00:41:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
incredibly painful.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had implanted
me with a fetus.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks later, I
felt the sensation

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.140 align:middle line:90%
of something coming out of me.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I reached down,
and I caught it.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a small,
tiny, little fetus.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing near
this room, and I'm

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
watching them put the fetus
into a round cylinder filled

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:90%
with liquid.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Any living species on this
planet would have more rights

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:90%
than that entity.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And no one was going to
speak out for its rights.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Because officially, he and
others like him don't exist.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The main reason
people see UFOs,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.020 align:middle line:10%
at least an awful lot of people,
is because they're involved

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.110 align:middle line:10%
in a hybridization program.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:27.570 align:middle line:10%
It's a joint program between
Zeta Reticulans and humans

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:10%
to develop better bodies
to house our souls

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:10%
in future incarnations.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
elected leaders just cannot

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:90%
talk about.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
No president, whether it's
Bill Clinton or Obama or Bush,

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:84%
can stand before the
public and say, yes, I'm

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
aware that we have this
program with Zeta Reticulans.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And we're picking up your
daughters and your wives,

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:10%
and you're taking their eggs,
splicing in some extra genes

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:10%
to give them a bigger computer,
a bigger hard drive, a faster

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.490 align:middle line:10%
chip, a USB port for telepathy.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We're re-implanting them, and
we know what generally they're

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:90%
going to look like.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And if they look
enough like you,

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:84%
we let the mothers
raise them to term.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:84%
If not, they take them at
3 and 1/2 months, put them

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:90%
in artificial wounds.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.080 align:middle line:10%
They have to live elsewhere
until the consciousness

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:10%
of the people on
this planet is raised

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.460 align:middle line:10%
to accept them as neighbors.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The past seven years, I've
been in 42 countries about

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:10%
the world, and I have had
discussions with numerous

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:10%
individuals who are involved in
the alien abduction phenomenon.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I've come to believe
that approximately 15%

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of these individuals may have
an object within their body

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.480 align:middle line:84%
as the result of the alien
abduction phenomenon.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
If we look at both the
metallurgical and biological

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.700 align:middle line:84%
findings, we find some
very astounding things.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We find that the
metal objects are

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
covered with a very
strange soft tissue

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
membrane, which is actually
attached into the metal.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, that goes far beyond
our scientific abilities.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:84%
We find also that in
the surrounding tissue,

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:84%
there are large
amounts of nerve cells

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:84%
which are not correct
for the particular area.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:84%
These are called
nerve proprioceptors.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they are responsible
for giving the energy supply

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:84%
so that this becomes
a functional object.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
metallurgical findings,

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.290 align:middle line:84%
we find that there are
several unusual things.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, the object being
metal and highly magnetic,

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.240 align:middle line:84%
containing large
amounts of iron,

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:84%
but yet the iron
is amorphous iron.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:middle line:90%
It's without crystalline form.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was able to find, through
black budget laboratories,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that we do know how to
make amorphous metals,

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know how
to make them magnetic.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's quite the anomaly.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the next most
telling metallurgical finding

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is that when we look at the
isotopic ratios for some

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.830 align:middle line:84%
of the metals
within the objects,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
we find that they are
non-terrestrial isotopic

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.170 align:middle line:90%
ratios.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So to sum up, we
have seen individuals

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.910 align:middle line:90%
who allege alien abduction.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:middle line:84%
They find an object
within their body

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920 align:middle line:84%
which is verified by X-ray,
a CAT scan, or an MRI.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.540 align:middle line:84%
They have some distress
from the object.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:90%
They want them removed.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.190 align:middle line:90%
We accept them as a candidate.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The object is removed, submitted
for scientific analysis.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we find things like
non-terrestrial isotopic

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.256 align:middle line:90%
ratios.

00:45:55.256 --> 00:45:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Then what is a
logical person going

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.653 align:middle line:84%
to conclude other than the fact
they are telling you the truth?

00:46:02.653 --> 00:46:06.990 align:middle line:10%
One of the most unusual objects
that I've come across recently

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:10%
is an object that was in
the arm of an abductee.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And this object moved
underneath the skin.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.015 align:middle line:84%
When you touched it
with your finger,

00:46:18.015 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:90%
it would move out of the way.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And after putting your finger
on the area for a while,

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.490 align:middle line:10%
it began to come to your finger.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It would go in the
opposite direction.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You could move your
finger someplace,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and the object would
actually come towards it.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Very, very strange,
hair-raising,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:84%
skin-crawling thing
to witness, even

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:84%
for me being in the medical
field for over 41 years.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:52.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The alien visitors that we
have here have technology that

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.730 align:middle line:10%
permits them not to just go from
a planet within a solar system

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:10%
to another planet within
that solar system.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.980 align:middle line:84%
They have devised ways to
travel vast distances--

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.760 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, thousands
of light years--

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.920 align:middle line:90%
in a very short period of time.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.770 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to acquire
that same technology.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In '93 in August, I had an
experience where I was taken

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.300 align:middle line:90%
by aliens.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But at one point,
I was handed over

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to military personnel, taken
to an underground base.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very intense
medical procedure done on me,

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.740 align:middle line:90%
gynecological in nature.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in November
of '93, I then

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.960 align:middle line:84%
had an experience where
I went to bed one night,

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and I was awoken by men in
camouflage uniform ripping

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:40.430 align:middle line:84%
my covers off my bed
and proceeding to drug

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.816 align:middle line:90%
me with a very oily substance.

00:47:41.816 --> 00:47:42.940 align:middle line:90%
They put me on a stretcher.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:90%
They carried me out of there.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I was taken to a base.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I was flown on a
triangular craft.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I ended up being taken from
one base to another base,

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.530 align:middle line:84%
where I was
interrogated about what

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I knew about alien technology.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually a specific
piece, a piece of a drive

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.412 align:middle line:90%
system that they wanted.

00:48:01.412 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a missing
component of it

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.402 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't quite figure out.

00:48:04.402 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, they were very
pleased with the information

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I gave them.

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They see us as a species
capable of such wonderful

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.680 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can do such
horrible, monstrous things

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.990 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Some years ago, I had
hypnosis and discovered that I

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.010 align:middle line:10%
have been an extraterrestrial
abductee since childhood.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.100 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that
I went into hypnosis

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.370 align:middle line:84%
was because I discovered a very
disturbing three-month block

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.770 align:middle line:84%
of missing time
from the time that I

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:33.560 align:middle line:84%
was in the military
in the Air Force.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:84%
When I did finally have
hypnosis to discover

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.410 align:middle line:84%
what happened to me
during that missing time,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:90%
it was very disturbing.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:10%
I was taken out in the middle
of the night to the radar site

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:51.010 align:middle line:10%
that I worked on at the Tonopah
Electronic Warfare Range.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Out there, they had
us trying to track

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial spacecraft
or possibly reverse

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.490 align:middle line:90%
engineered spacecraft.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:59.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a frightening event--

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.670 align:middle line:84%
not that the craft
were frightening,

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:84%
but the circumstances
were frightening.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.550 align:middle line:84%
After we tried
the test, which it

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:12.260 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to me that the radar
was tracking the UFOs or the ET

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.290 align:middle line:84%
craft, we were put on
a vehicle and taken

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:90%
to what I believe was Area 51.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:84%
While there, I was injected
with an unknown substance.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I was taken down a very
long flight of stairs

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and thrown into an
observation room

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.310 align:middle line:84%
while I went through the
effects of the injection.

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.790 align:middle line:90%
It was intensely traumatic.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:34.850 align:middle line:10%
As I was recovering from the
effects of the injection,

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.580 align:middle line:10%
I was dragged out of that
room and sexually assaulted

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.300 align:middle line:10%
by two security guards.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, this is not
any woman's girlhood dream

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.440 align:middle line:84%
to stand in front of a
camera and tell people

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.960 align:middle line:90%
this kind of thing.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But I do tell it because I
hope that in the telling,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that I can illustrate that
there are things going

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:84%
on in our government that are
far and away out of control

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:90%
with no checks and balances.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.510 align:middle line:10%
National security
and secrets kept

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:10%
for reasons of national
security no longer

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.530 align:middle line:10%
serve the people that they
are supposed to protect.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.470 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of abduction
researchers start to feel that

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:10%
this somehow explains away
alien abduction and that

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.160 align:middle line:10%
it's a military
in lieu of aliens.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's a military
covert ops, when quite frankly,

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this is the
intelligence community

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:90%
involvement.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:90%
It's people lab coats.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's people in other
types of uniforms.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly intelligence
operatives involved.

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's military
personnel and people

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:34.970 align:middle line:90%
in the military uniforms.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So I call it covert
ops because I

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.490 align:middle line:84%
think it includes many black
project covert groups that

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.260 align:middle line:90%
could be involved in some way.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:84%
In these experiences,
a lot of times

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.250 align:middle line:84%
there's an
interrogation involved.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And what they seem to
be most interested in

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:84%
are four categories
of information.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.770 align:middle line:84%
One is the alien agenda
and alien motives.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Why are they interested
in the abductee?

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Why is this person
having this happen?

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Does the abductee have a
sense for why the aliens are

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.420 align:middle line:90%
interested in them?

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And what do they know overall?

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Have the aliens told them
about any agenda or motives?

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.870 align:middle line:90%
What are their plans?

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Where are they taking this?

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Does the abductee know,
or does the abductee

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.340 align:middle line:90%
have any sense of that?

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.437 align:middle line:84%
Secondly is alien and
abductee genetics.

00:51:18.437 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of medical
stuff that goes on,

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.811 align:middle line:10%
like in my own
experience, but that's

00:51:21.811 --> 00:51:24.530 align:middle line:10%
common to other
people who have shared

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:10%
similar experiences with me.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
interest in what did

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:90%
the aliens do to us medically.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Did they alter us medically?

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Did they alter us genetically?

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.562 align:middle line:84%
Is there something unique about
our genetics as abductees?

00:51:36.562 --> 00:51:38.770 align:middle line:84%
This is another big thing
they seem to be interested.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:39.770 align:middle line:90%
That's second.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Third is paranormal abilities.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Does the abductee-- are
they able to remote view?

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.326 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to do
psychokenesis, telekinesis?

00:51:48.326 --> 00:51:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Are they able to do telepathy?

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Do they move matter
with their mind?

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Have they flown a ship and
operated equipment on board

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that they have done
so with their mind?

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Can they duplicate that
for these covert ops guys?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Can they duplicate it
under pressure and at will?

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Or can they be drugged
or used in hypnosis

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and have that enhanced
by them where they're

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:11.596 align:middle line:84%
able to pull it out even
though maybe the abductee isn't

00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:90%
able to do it on their own?

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.660 align:middle line:84%
This kind of thing, so
this paranormal component.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then last, but
certainly not least,

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest of all
four, is their interest

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:90%
in the technology.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.490 align:middle line:84%
If the covert ops guys have
a piece of alien technology,

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.290 align:middle line:84%
can they hand it
to the abductee?

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And does the abductee
know how to operate it?

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I have many cases of this
kind of thing going on.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Have they seen the technology?

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Have they operated it?

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Has it been described to them?

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Has the propulsion
been described to them?

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Have they seen weaponry?

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Has the weaponry been
described to them?

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Do they know anything about
the cloaking abilities?

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.440 align:middle line:84%
All this kind of
stuff is a big thing

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.670 align:middle line:90%
that they're interested in.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are the four
categories of information.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But again, it suggests that
these covert ops really

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:84%
believed these people have
had these alien experiences.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Or why would they be asking
them those questions?

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to really emphasize that
it is not a military in lieu

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:90%
of alien abduction thesis.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It is a covert ops
interest in the abductees

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:84%
because they have had
very real experiences.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it is some of
the strongest evidence

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.180 align:middle line:90%
in support of alien abduction.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:84%
If alien abductions
aren't real, why

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.280 align:middle line:90%
would all this be happening?

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.280 align:middle line:10%
I've been involved in
many, many abductions,

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.200 align:middle line:10%
one mass abduction
in particular I'll

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:10%
never forget the
rest of my life.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of us were shown,
on tiny little monitors,

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.220 align:middle line:90%
beautiful Earth scenes--

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.690 align:middle line:90%
the sea, the mountains.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They were drop dead gorgeous.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, these scenes
deteriorated with pollution

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and made us very sad.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And we were given a message.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And the message was you're
killing your planet.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Your planet is dying.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.970 align:middle line:90%
We must act soon.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in command of
10 nuclear missiles.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The guard was extremely
agitated, very fearful,

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.410 align:middle line:84%
screaming into the phone, saying
he was looking at a bright,

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.900 align:middle line:84%
glowing red object just
outside the front gate.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.320 align:middle line:90%
All the guards were out there.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Their weapons were drawn.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:84%
At that point, we got a lot
of bells and whistles, alarms.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And missiles started to
go no go, which means

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.560 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't be launched.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:15.390 align:middle line:84%
All in all, we lost nearly
20 missiles to UFOs.

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.970 align:middle line:84%
This is very significant
that the UFOs

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:84%
seem to be focusing on our
nuclear weapons facilities.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.620 align:middle line:10%
They're trying to
send us a message,

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.950 align:middle line:10%
and that has to do
with getting rid

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.170 align:middle line:10%
of all nuclear weapons
on this planet.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1953, Joe Adamski
witnessed a number

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
visiting on the spacecraft.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.030 align:middle line:10%
And their message was the same.

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.520 align:middle line:10%
They were very concerned
about humanity's testing

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:10%
of nuclear weapons,
and they were

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:10%
worried that humanity
could wipe itself out

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.960 align:middle line:10%
by the irresponsible use of
these nuclear technologies.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Gorbachev was sitting at the
edge of a field when a huge UFO

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:56.940 align:middle line:90%
came and landed.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:03.630 align:middle line:10%
And a nine-foot-tall alien
came out and told Gorbachev

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:09.420 align:middle line:10%
who he was and why he was
here, and told Gorbachev

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:15.120 align:middle line:10%
that the Soviet Union needs to
have more transparency and less

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.270 align:middle line:10%
repression.

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The next six days after
that, an unidentified object

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:84%
was seen to come in
on a straight line

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
toward the center of Voronezh, a
town there in the Soviet Union.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the seventh day, it had
gathered a fairly big audience.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 400 people.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And it landed downtown.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And that landing did make
news around the world.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The alien gets out and
talks to people for a while.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then a KGB van
pulls up and arrests

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:55.440 align:middle line:90%
this nine-foot-tall alien.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Two little aliens
get out and start

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:01.800 align:middle line:84%
talking to the audience
for about an hour,

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and then the KGB
returns the alien.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.182 align:middle line:84%
And as he walks back
on to the spaceship,

00:56:08.182 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:90%
the little alien is saluting.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And they go, close the
door, and take off.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Right after that, Gorbachev
did start the programs

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of Glasnost and Perestroika
for more openness and less

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.335 align:middle line:90%
repression.

00:56:22.335 --> 00:56:26.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The military's own goal was
to create a series of satellite

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:10%
bases to then launch a series of
missiles or tubes, if you will,

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.895 align:middle line:10%
up to the moon, and then have
a series of astronauts go up

00:56:33.895 --> 00:56:36.700 align:middle line:10%
there and screw all these tubes
together and create an instant

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:10%
moonbase that they can then
have a high ground of space.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.520 align:middle line:10%
And it was called
Project Horizon.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.550 align:middle line:10%
Project Horizon was probably
getting 10 times more money

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.730 align:middle line:10%
than NASA was
getting at that time.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So the whole NASA
thing was just a front.

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But it was the civilian
peaceful pursuit of space

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.645 align:middle line:84%
while the military,
rather savagely,

00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:56.520 align:middle line:84%
went after the military
application of space.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.895 align:middle line:10%
>> The military
mind has prevailed.

00:56:59.895 --> 00:57:04.170 align:middle line:10%
And the US is going to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.930 align:middle line:10%
to put a base on the moon.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of things bother
me about that, I guess.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.310 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if
the moon is used

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:15.800 align:middle line:84%
as an advanced base for some
of the extraterrestrials,

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.870 align:middle line:84%
as has been widely
rumored, I don't

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
know what kind of reception
the American pioneers

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.970 align:middle line:90%
will get when they get there.

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.780 align:middle line:10%
And secondly, the
amount of money

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.290 align:middle line:10%
that's involved to use it
on a project as questionable

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:35.300 align:middle line:10%
as this when millions of people
are starving on Earth for lack

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:39.100 align:middle line:10%
of proper food and water and
medical care, I just think,

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.190 align:middle line:10%
is a very, very bad
way to spend resources.

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And I just think it--

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.750 align:middle line:10%
frankly, I think it's immoral.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:10%
>> For what purpose?

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:53.480 align:middle line:10%
For the purpose of maintaining
the permanent war economy

00:57:53.480 --> 00:58:00.080 align:middle line:10%
on this planet in defiance
the will of the people

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.015 align:middle line:10%
of this planet, i.e.

00:58:02.015 --> 00:58:06.350 align:middle line:84%
giving then informed
consent, in defiance

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:12.180 align:middle line:84%
of the proper care of the
ecology of this planet, where

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we're caretakers of what is,
in essence, a universe commons.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The human race does not have
right, title, and interest

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.090 align:middle line:90%
to this planet.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.680 align:middle line:10%
>> To date, we've never had
any situations where they were

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.480 align:middle line:10%
hostile.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.440 align:middle line:10%
We've been hostile, but
they haven't been hostile.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.400 align:middle line:84%
We have had situations where
we would shoot at them.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And here again, it's human
to go ahead and strike out

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:42.060 align:middle line:84%
at something you fear or
something that's unknown.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the nature
of the human species.

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:49.540 align:middle line:10%
- The NRO has now
developed radar

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.640 align:middle line:10%
which tracks the
extraterrestrial light ships

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.440 align:middle line:10%
in the next dimension over.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:03.630 align:middle line:10%
So this is the deployment
of practically the entirety

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:10.613 align:middle line:10%
of space weapons against
friendly, integrated

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:17.520 align:middle line:10%
higher plan universe plan
for the positive evolution

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.750 align:middle line:10%
of this planet.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:25.680 align:middle line:84%
- I personally believe that
Eisenhower did indeed meet with

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:30.930 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial,
off-world astronauts.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.500 align:middle line:10%
I would like to
submit to our nation

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.460 align:middle line:10%
my personal testimony
of one document related

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:42.090 align:middle line:10%
to one of these
ongoing topics, which

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:47.850 align:middle line:10%
I saw while in office serving
on the state Federal Relations

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:51.150 align:middle line:10%
and Veterans Affairs Committee.

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:54.870 align:middle line:84%
The document I saw
was an official brief

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to President Eisenhower.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.290 align:middle line:84%
To the best of my
memory, this brief

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:05.730 align:middle line:84%
was pervaded with
a sense of hope.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it informed
President Eisenhower

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of the continued presence
of extraterrestrial beings

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.980 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States of America.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The brief seemed to
indicate that a meeting

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
between the president and
some of these visitors

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
could be arranged as
appropriate if desired.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
The tone of the
brief indicated to me

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that there was no
need for concern

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:42.000 align:middle line:84%
since these visitors were
in no way causing any harm

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
or had any intention whatsoever
of causing any disruption then

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%
or in the future.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at this video,
we have to ask ourselves,

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
how many other craft
have we shot at?

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
How many other craft
have we shot down?

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we ourselves are
ever to become a spacefaring

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
civilization, can we
expect the same hospitality

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.020 align:middle line:90%
when we visit other worlds?

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Take the US National
Missile Defense System.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's a
trillion-dollar weapon system.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.880 align:middle line:10%
That's the most
expensive weapons system

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.920 align:middle line:10%
in the history of the world.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
weapons system which

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
will develop the technology for
putting space-based platforms

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and space weapons,
laser weapons,

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.533 align:middle line:84%
space-based
interceptors in space

01:01:35.533 --> 01:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to attack benevolent
extraterrestrial civilizations

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that are really here on an
integrated galactic plan

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.700 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of our planet.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
- I doubt that there's a single
member of Congress that's

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
in the loop as far as the
alien secret is concerned.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I doubt if there's one.

01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll bet you there
are a lot of things

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that they're financing
that they don't know about.

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:03.630 align:middle line:10%
This is a dereliction
of duty on their part

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:05.070 align:middle line:10%
because they have
a responsibility

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:06.840 align:middle line:10%
to be protectors
of the public purse

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.470 align:middle line:10%
and to know what they're doing.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.150 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think they do.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:16.180 align:middle line:10%
How can you have proper
civilian control of the military

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.450 align:middle line:10%
if they don't know
what's going on?

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Shortly before 9/11, in the
summer of '01, Rumsfeld told

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:27.270 align:middle line:10%
the Senate that they could
not track $2.3 trillion

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.260 align:middle line:10%
in transactions.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, just to put
that in context,

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.600 align:middle line:10%
the Pentagon's official
budget for that fiscal year

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.190 align:middle line:10%
was about $310 billion,
or 1/8 the amount.

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible to lose
eight times your annual budget?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.120 align:middle line:10%
After 9/11, that
question-- that is,

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.770 align:middle line:10%
the missing Pentagon money--

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.560 align:middle line:10%
literally became tabled as a
matter of national security.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.180 align:middle line:10%
What is clear is that there
is a lot of money flowing

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.610 align:middle line:10%
through federal offices
that is of uncertain origin

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:01.000 align:middle line:10%
and of uncertain destination.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
way to siphon out

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
billions and
trillions of dollars

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of
covert activities

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that have no
oversight whatsoever.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Interestingly enough,
the majority of fatalities

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.140 align:middle line:10%
at the Pentagon on
9/11 involve members

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.040 align:middle line:10%
of the Army's accounting office,
the very people who would be

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.760 align:middle line:10%
looking into the
missing $2.3 trillion.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.470 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the important
things, I think,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.053 align:middle line:10%
that they would want
us to understand,

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.670 align:middle line:10%
and we need to
understand eventually,

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.790 align:middle line:10%
is that we sometimes go ahead--

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:36.240 align:middle line:10%
don't worry what happens
to the other guy.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I tell you it is very
important to be concerned

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
what happens to others.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
That ties into universal
love and universal good.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
We haven't gotten the message.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's OK if it
happens to the other guy.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK if it happens to us.

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
But always remember this--

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:00.345 align:middle line:84%
to the other guy, you
are the other guy.

01:04:00.345 --> 01:04:03.000 align:middle line:10%
- Well, I was in
Switzerland investigating

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.440 align:middle line:10%
the case of Billy Meier.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.080 align:middle line:10%
One of the ladies there, a
multi-lingual translator,

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.720 align:middle line:10%
told me I should look into a
Dutch case down in Holland.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me the name
and the telephone number

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of the witness.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.774 align:middle line:90%
She said, he's a well-known man.

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.315 align:middle line:84%
He'll tell you about
the case, but he

01:04:19.315 --> 01:04:21.315 align:middle line:84%
won't let you use his
name or image or anything.

01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.372 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's fine.

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know the details.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.663 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, the details
are really remarkable,

01:04:25.663 --> 01:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because they're extraterrestrial
visitors that can

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
go underwater with their craft.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Holland
and looked the man up.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
He was a tall man.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.960 align:middle line:90%
He was almost seven feet tall.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
He was a giant man. a
very, very kind person.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
He had a nice family, a wife,
and a teenage daughter and son.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
The family had a
private schacht.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a flat-bottomed, small
yacht that one person can sail.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were sailing
recreationally

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in the [INAUDIBLE],, the
west sea south of Rotterdam.

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And they struck an object
in the clear channel.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.070 align:middle line:90%
The yacht bounced off from it.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
After he struck something in the
water, he looked over the rail

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
and saw a body floating.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
His quick first reaction
was to jump over the rail

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.690 align:middle line:90%
and rescue the body.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And when he turned it over,
he saw a completely different

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.990 align:middle line:90%
morphology.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.160 align:middle line:90%
The features were different.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything was different.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.460 align:middle line:84%
He picked it up in
his arms, and he

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
was waiting on this underwater
surface that was now rising.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It came up above
the water level,

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and a black tower rose out
of the center out of it.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
A door opened in the side,
and another being in a suit,

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
just like the one in
his arms, came out

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and took the second
one out of his arms

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and took him down inside.

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Then he came right back to
the door of the little tower

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and thanked him for
rescuing his fellow.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The family spent the
night in the schacht

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
in the clear channel.

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So when the aliens emerged
again in the morning,

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.480 align:middle line:84%
they moved him a little
closer out of the channel

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to a side of the channel
and submerged again

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
after taking him aboard.

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
They sat him in front
of viewing screens

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and showed him how
to use controls

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
to zoom and pan on images
that came up on the screen.

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they allowed
him to ask questions.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
When he looked to
his right, there

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
was a curved blue glass
window with three or four

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of these creatures, just like
the one that he had rescued,

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
facing him through the glass,
watching him ask the questions.

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were
using some controls

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and bringing images up on
the viewing screens for him

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.880 align:middle line:90%
to observe.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
What he asked about their
living, about how they lived,

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
they brought up images of
their apartment complexes,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
their homes, even the
interiors of their homes.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.700 align:middle line:84%
When he asked about their
commercial facilities,

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
they showed him shopping centers
in their apartment complexes.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.500 align:middle line:90%
He asked about agriculture.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
They showed him automated
agricultural systems

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that produced all of the
foodstuffs automatically.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They told him that the land
surface of their planet

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.210 align:middle line:90%
was less than ours.

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:50.605 align:middle line:84%
There was about
20% land surface,

01:06:50.605 --> 01:06:52.690 align:middle line:90%
whereas ours is about 35%.

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%
They are semi-aquatic creatures.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The population density
on their planet

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.160 align:middle line:90%
was considerably more than ours.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But they have a lot
of aquatic activity.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.900 align:middle line:10%
They live near the
water, and they can even

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.780 align:middle line:10%
stay underwater for up to
30 minutes, like a seal,

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.510 align:middle line:10%
and then come back up
for air, whereas we

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:11.350 align:middle line:10%
don't have those capabilities.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.280 align:middle line:10%
It's just part of their
nature, their physiology,

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.780 align:middle line:10%
and their society.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And they have underwater
creatures that they farm.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.345 align:middle line:84%
It's a unique society, but
it was completely different

01:07:22.345 --> 01:07:23.145 align:middle line:90%
from ours.

01:07:23.145 --> 01:07:24.491 align:middle line:90%
Their morphology was different.

01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Their sciences were different.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.287 align:middle line:90%
Their technology was different.

01:07:27.287 --> 01:07:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Their foodstuffs were different.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything was different.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're just as ambient
as we are and can get around

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
the stars.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.145 align:middle line:84%
And we can't even leave this
planet to go anyplace yet.

01:07:36.145 --> 01:07:38.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps the most important
question the human race has

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:43.170 align:middle line:10%
ever asked is who are we
and where did we come from.

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, after 30 years of
research on our work,

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe I know an answer.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
The answer is we
didn't come from here.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.480 align:middle line:90%
We came from Mars.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The Russians, back in the
late '50s, early '60s, did

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
about a 40-page report
in which they were--

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
some of their scientists
were concluding

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that there was martians and
that they actually lived inside

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
of two moons of Mars.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a similarity
between all this megalithic

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.279 align:middle line:10%
construction that's
all over the world.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And even structures like
obelisks and pyramids

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.609 align:middle line:84%
and huge platforms can
be found on our moon.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And I maintain
that even the NASA

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
missions have
discovered what seemed

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.390 align:middle line:90%
to be structures on the moon.

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're essentially
covering up these discoveries.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that we have, say,
extraterrestrial structures

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, and
probably on Mars, too,

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a similarity
between those structures

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.960 align:middle line:84%
on the moon and Mars and
many of these structures

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.939 align:middle line:90%
that are found here on Earth.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:10.609 align:middle line:10%
>> I would like to recount a
session I had with a young,

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:15.140 align:middle line:10%
13-year-old girl in 1996,
which is about 15 years ago.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.979 align:middle line:84%
She suddenly recounts that
she can see a red planet.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's a red
planet that has a face on it.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
She said, it's a really strange
face, but it's an amazing face.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.319 align:middle line:84%
And then she proceeds
to say that she's

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
seeing under the ground
there are beings there.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And these beings are telling
her that we come from there.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.109 align:middle line:10%
And this alone
was quite amazing.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that,
she then says,

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing an American flag.

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is in 1996.

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
really know what to make of it.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But since that time, I
discovered, of course,

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
the face on Mars.

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense now
that there may very well

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.540 align:middle line:90%
be life of some kind on Mars.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But the most incredible
thing is we are now

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.501 align:middle line:84%
hearing from whistleblowers that
there is some form of jumpgate,

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and the military-- there was
some military that actually are

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
going to secret bases on Mars.

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So this young
lady, 15 years ago,

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
was saying some of
what could actually

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
be now absolutely credible.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And I find this has
great veracity coming

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
from a 13-year-old girl that
knew nothing about any of this

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:35.310 align:middle line:90%


01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:38.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Individuals have come forward
to reveal that human-looking

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrials are living
and walking amongst us.

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
In 1975, a Swiss farmer
by the name of Billy Meier

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
had a number of interactions
with extraterrestrial visitors

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that lasted for a
number of years.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:53.490 align:middle line:10%
They came in ships that
were witnessed by Meier

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:56.250 align:middle line:10%
and a number of other
independent individuals.

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.410 align:middle line:10%
Meier took photographs
of these ships.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:01.020 align:middle line:10%
One of these visitors
was named Simjasse.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
She was a very beautiful
extraterrestrial female

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
who gave Meier a philosophy of
how humanity could deal more

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
responsibly with
the environment,

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of humanity,
and with the other species

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.840 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The evidence is
overwhelming now.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.060 align:middle line:10%
The evidence is so great now.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:22.920 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible to
just say it's nonsense.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
People who say it's
nonsense do not

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
understand what this
phenomenon is about.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It is amazingly important.

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that this is,
in fact, an existential threat.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:43.335 align:middle line:84%
I began to hear stories of
people moving into society.

01:11:43.335 --> 01:11:47.580 align:middle line:10%
You had Hubrids who are
moving in in twos and threes

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.530 align:middle line:10%
and fours into apartments.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.720 align:middle line:10%
They are moving into
many apartments.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.360 align:middle line:10%
Abductees are helping them.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.980 align:middle line:10%
The title "Walking
Among Us" comes

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.690 align:middle line:10%
from my favorite question.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And the question was--

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
when people and I would
do interviews-- do

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:03.319 align:middle line:90%
you think they're living here?

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they're
walking among us?

01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say,
absolutely not.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
There is no evidence whatsoever
that they are walking among us.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that anymore.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
important program for them.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
vacation type deal,

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
or they're just coming
to examine us and see

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.340 align:middle line:90%
what we look like.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a whole different story.

01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
that I can say--

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and this is a guess.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
This is speculation.

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
fits the best is what

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I call planetary acquisition.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
This is, in fact, the
taking over of the planet

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
itself for reasons
that we do not know.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But the best thing that I
can say that is probably

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
irrefutable-- if this is
planetary acquisition,

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
it benefits them.

01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.060 align:middle line:90%
In some way, it benefits them.

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.587 align:middle line:90%
That's all we know about it.

01:13:01.587 --> 01:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%


01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.117 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of controversy
about what the reasons are

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.241 align:middle line:90%
for the cattle mutilations.

01:13:09.241 --> 01:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing it?

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
If it's the government, if
it's aliens, if they're in

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
sync together with
some kind of agenda.

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there is a large
body of very compelling evidence

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealing with an
alien intelligence behind

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
the cattle mutilations.

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:27.090 align:middle line:10%
I think the rest is
speculation as to why

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.780 align:middle line:10%
an alien intelligence would be
interested in a bovine rectum.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of any
other precedent in history

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%
where the perfect crime has been
perpetrated 8,000, 10,000 times

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:39.957 align:middle line:84%
with no one ever being
caught over 30 years.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I would go out into the field,
and they would would say, yeah,

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
we saw the black helicopter.

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.160 align:middle line:90%
But we also saw a flying saucer.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So I went, oh, my goodness.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.147 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the government
has got flying saucers, too.

01:13:51.147 --> 01:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So then the further I
dug, people would say,

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we saw the aliens
bent over the cow.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they levitated the cow
up into a flying saucer.

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the black helicopters
came the next morning.

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So this curious mix
started to evolve.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
As I got out into the
field and I investigated,

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:09.015 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to these
ranchers, and I found out

01:14:09.015 --> 01:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that they were obviously
sincere and had no reason

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to fabricate these
stories, I started

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
to take them more seriously.

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There were flying saucers
flying everywhere around

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
right here where we are,
around this mountain range.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It was saturated with what we
call classic flying saucers.

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:26.760 align:middle line:10%
Last year, I was in Roswell,
New Mexico giving a talk.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into an old
research friend of mine who's

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
a very reputable scientist.

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
He worked for Sandia Labs for
29 years, quite respected,

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:37.380 align:middle line:90%
a high security clearance.

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I was having a
little chat with him.

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the aliens are
taking bacteria from these cows

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and using it to nurture
hybrid babies in space.

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Then he went on to
say that his wife--

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
he and his wife had
voluntarily consented

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.862 align:middle line:84%
to have alien hybrid babies,
and the babies were gone.

probably on other planets

01:14:58.530 --> 01:14:59.070 align:middle line:90%

01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%

He was totally sincere.

Here's a man that's 29

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
He and his wife produced
hybrid alien babies.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens
told him that they

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
had to have this
bacteria from the cattle

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%

This is not a matter

>> There are a growing number of
people in the world who are now

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.690 align:middle line:10%
perfectly convinced
that several, at least,

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:55.600 align:middle line:10%
other civilizations,
non-human civilizations,

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.240 align:middle line:10%
exist in our own
Milky Way galaxy.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the United States
Congressional Research Service,

01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
as pointed out
earlier, has concluded

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.390 align:middle line:10%
that there are at least two
to six other such highly

01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:10.750 align:middle line:10%
technologically developed
civilizations in our own Milky

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Way galaxy.

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:13.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's important to
understand that there

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:19.010 align:middle line:10%
are 500 trillion galaxies.

01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So the probabilities

visited by any number

is looming in the

Indeed, the Vatican in Rome,
back in November of 2009,

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.740 align:middle line:10%
held a five-day conference.

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.190 align:middle line:10%

discussing the potential

civilization, the members
of the press conference

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:46.360 align:middle line:10%
held at the Vatican concluded
that it is very possible

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.910 align:middle line:10%
that we will be confirming
the existence of such

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.380 align:middle line:10%
a civilization within
the next very few years.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And they have called
upon our human family

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:58.720 align:middle line:10%
to begin to give very
serious consideration

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.350 align:middle line:10%
to the philosophical and
theological implications

01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:05.980 align:middle line:10%
of our upcoming contact with
a non-human, extraterrestrial

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.720 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It is now time for those of
us in the world who now come

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%
to know that this is true--

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
for us to no longer wait
for governments to tell us

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that it's true, or for major
institutional religions to tell

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
us what it is that we're
supposed to think about this.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.550 align:middle line:10%
The time has come for us
as citizens of the world

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:31.990 align:middle line:10%
to begin to gather together to
discuss not just whether this

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:35.560 align:middle line:10%
is true, but the full
philosophical and theological

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.440 align:middle line:10%
implications of the
upcoming contact

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.860 align:middle line:10%
with a non-human,
highly-developed civilization.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We try to achieve
that technology.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, we will
achieve that technology.

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.722 align:middle line:84%
We will achieve
interstellar travel,

01:20:57.722 --> 01:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we're
going to be able to go

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:04.910 align:middle line:84%
from one solar system
to another solar system.

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:09.800 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, the
day after tomorrow,

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.222 align:middle line:84%
we are going to become
