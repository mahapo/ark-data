00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If we're being visited and if
there is other life out there,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
think for a moment how
staggeringly unlikely it is

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that there's just one
other civilization.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So in a universe over 14
billion years old with trillions

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
upon trillions of galaxies where
each galaxy, like our Milky

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Way, contains hundreds
of millions of stars,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
what are the chances
that we're alone?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Virtually zero.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:10%
What are the chances
that in all of that,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:10%
there's only one
other civilization?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:10%
No, that's crazy.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:10%
The chances of there being two
civilizations in the universe

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:10%
are slim.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I mean pretty much zero
as the chances of there being

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:90%
just one, I ask being alone.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So that being the case,
what we are dealing with

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is probably a
situation where there's

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
a whole range of other
civilizations out there,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
some favorably disposed towards
us, some neutral, some hostile.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Alien abduction, alien
contact, alien experience, this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:10%
is just language.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:90%
It's labels.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The real question
here is, is there

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
interaction at some
level between humans

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And related to that, if there
is that interaction, what's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:90%
going on?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people, for example,
talk about the purpose of this

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
being some sort of
hybridization program.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Are they a dying race
who need to incorporate

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
fresh genetic material
from human beings?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Did they create us?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And are they tinkering with us?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
This is a version of ancient
astronaut theory in some ways,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the ancient
gods were our creators.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They seeded us here and
now they're coming back.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And then related to that,
the $64,000 question.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
If aliens are visiting,
are they not just coming

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and going but are they
here already among us?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Where does
civilization begin?

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Mesopotamia, we are
told, which leads us back

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to the history of the Sumerians
and the telling of the Anunnaki

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
gods who descended to
Earth and fashioned

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:90%
what we call modern men.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:10%
And what did they believe?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:10%
They believed that
in ancient times,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:10%
godlike beings descended from
the sky and came to Earth.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is the
meaning of Anunnaki.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki means those
who came from the sky

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and down to the Earth.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And that myth to
us, history to them,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
tells a story of
a race of beings

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
that came from another
planet called Nibiru.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:10%
And this Nibiru is a planet
that has an elliptical orbit

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:10%
and it takes 3,600 years
for it to go from, let's

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
say, the inner solar system
to the outer solar system

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:10%
and then back again.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The problem for Earth is that
every 3,000 years, Nibiru

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
comes by and exerts
a very powerful

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
gravitational electromagnetic
field upon the Earth, which

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
causes devastation.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And the most recent epic
of the Anunnaki history

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
regards the past 3,600 years
and the re-establishment

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of human civilization
after the last devastation,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
which is traditionally
called the flood.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did these gods, what
I call aliens, come to Earth?

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:10%
When you read the works
of Zecharia Sitchin,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:10%
you realize from
the Sumerian text

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:10%
that the inhabitants of Nibiru
needed certain minerals that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:10%
are on Earth in order to
continue their civilization.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Their planet is threatened
by solar radiation.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And the story goes
that they needed gold.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
In order to take the gold and
transform it into a monatomic

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
form in order to seed their
atmosphere so that the gold

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
would protect them from the
harmful radiations of the sun

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
as they do their
3,600-year transit.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So they came to Earth
looking for resources

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and they found them.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And they found them
in the Middle East

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and they found them
in Africa, which

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:90%
is a mineral-rich continent.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
They assigned their crew
men to become the miners,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and for a long time, the crewmen
of the Anunnaki spaceships

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:90%
They were called the Igigi--

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I-G-I-G-I, Igigi.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
However, the Igigi grew weary.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
They had not signed on to become
slaves mining in dark caves

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and they rebelled.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And when the rebellion
occurred, there

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
was a council of the
Anunnaki, Enlil, Enki,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and the other so-called
gods, higher-ranking aliens.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They decided to engineer
another being as a slave being

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:90%
to do this kind of work.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they engineered
the first atom.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
detailed description

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of how the gods
came together, each

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
contributed some part
of his DNA and her DNA.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a goddess who
became the repository

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%
for this new life form.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So each of the gods contributed
some aspect of their DNA

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:90%
to make us more like them.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And what is more like them?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Knowing, knowledge
of good and evil,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:10%
knowing life,
knowing the existence

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:10%
of life and death
and immortality.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And so this is where we stand.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:10%
We are only now finding
out about human origins

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:10%
and it is the problem that
science has established itself

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:10%
as the New World
religion and fears

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:10%
the revelation of these things.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It fears the revelation of
an antecedent civilization

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
with higher technology
than we possess today.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
It fears the moving
of the cornerstone.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Another cornerstone of science
is evolutionary theory,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:90%
which is a hypothesis.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing proven about
evolution or Darwinism.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Something affected the course of
humankind for years and years.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:90%
They call it the missing link.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Missing link hasn't been found.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Because we're the missing link.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what Zecharia
Sitchin came

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to believe because he
translated the Sumerian tablets.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:90%
He was a qualified scholar.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:90%
He did years of work.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.373 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote several
books on this,

00:08:01.373 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:10%
and I recommend
them to you if you

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:10%
want to know this
in detail, called

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.795 align:middle line:10%
The Earth, The 7th Planet.

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:10%
And we call it the third planet.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:10%
Now, why did he call
it the seventh planet?

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:10%
Because he was translating
the Sumerian history

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:10%
and the Anunnaki
description of the Earth.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And since they came to the Earth
from outside the solar system,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
they started counting
the planets out there

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:90%
from Pluto inward.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:10%
And if you count
from Pluto inward,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:10%
you find out that the
Earth is the seventh planet

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:10%
in the Anunnaki
scheme, although it

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:10%
is third planet from
the Sun in the way we

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:10%
see the solar system.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
I refer to Maurice Chatelain
who was a engineer with NASA.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Maurice Chatelain
was a genius, and he

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
found in the Sumerian tablets
a whole series of numbers.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Astronomically large
numbers, numbers

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:84%
beyond even our modern
need or comprehension.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
studying them and what

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
he found when he analyzed these
numbers and divided them by 60,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
he found that they
were the periods

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:90%
of the orbits of the planets.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
The orbits of Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and so

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.185 align:middle line:90%
on, notated to the second.

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians knew the orbital
period of Jupiter and Mars

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and they notated it in
the number of seconds--

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
not days, not hours, not
years, they had it in seconds.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And Maurice Chatelain discovered
this in the late 1960s.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, he was an
engineer who worked for NASA,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
came across these documents,
compared them, did his studies,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and made this
remarkable discovery.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:10%
So how did the Sumerians
know and why do they

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:10%
need to know and calculate
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:10%
in seconds?

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Only people, beings that need
to navigate amongst the planets

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
need to know how many seconds it
takes Jupiter to orbit the Sun,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
or how many seconds
it takes Mars

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to orbit the Sun, obviously,
in order to calculate and plot

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
trajectories, intersections,
interceptions, gravity slings.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
You do know that we know
how to approach a planet

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and use the gravity of that
planet to sling a spacecraft

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and accelerate it
to another place.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
This has become an
art form in our time.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
this is something

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that was known in
ancient times as well.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:52.257 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.257 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the enduring mysteries
from World War II was did

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:10%
Hitler and any of his German
compatriots actually end up

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:10%
in Argentina and then perhaps
further south in Antarctica?

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:10%
>> During the 1930s, the
German government, the Nazis,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:10%
were interested in setting
up some kind of base

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:10%
on Antarctica.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's absolutely
historical fact,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and they sent a couple
of expeditions out there.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:10%
And at least on
one occasion, they

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:10%
claimed an area known as
Neuschwabenland and land

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:10%
and they flew over and dropped
a lot of swastika flags

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.247 align:middle line:10%
on the ice there to
claim it as theirs.

00:11:32.247 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:10%
So that much all happened.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:10%
>> It is well
known that in 1938,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:10%
the Germans established a
base in Neuschwabenland,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:10%
this area of remote Antarctica
where they claimed to have

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:10%
found open land,
warm water lakes,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:10%
and at the end of the war,
Admiral Doenitz announced that

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:10%
they had built an impregnable
fortress for the fuhrer

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:10%
in Antarctica.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The Nazis sent scientists,
they sent botanists,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:10%
they sent a whole slew of
people to settle that colony.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:10%
So evidently, they
had found a warm place

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:10%
under the ice in which to
establish that colony where

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:10%
they wouldn't have
sent all those people.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:10%
And to have done this in 1938,
a year before World War II,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:10%
means that it was
very important to them

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:10%
to establish that
colony in 1938.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Because they had to be busy
with war plans at that point,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:10%
they were very invading
Poland in one year,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:10%
to send all these
people to Antarctica

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.028 align:middle line:10%
5,000 miles across the
Atlantic at that point.

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:42.945 align:middle line:10%
It had to be something
very important to them.

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1946, a British
expeditionary force or military

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:10%
force was sent to Antarctica
to explore the area.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were driven back
with horrible stories

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:90%
of being decimated.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They ran into something
that devastated the mission

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
and decimated the force.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
They got word back to England
and it is not coincidence

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that within a year, the
United States government

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
manned the largest
military operation ever

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
mounted to go to Antarctica.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
It's called Operation Highjump.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
This was commanded
by Admiral Byrd.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an attempt to wipe out
the German colony in Antarctica

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%
after World War II.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They sent a fleet of 13 ships
to try and destroy the base.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
There was an aircraft
carrier, the Philippine Sea,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
there were several destroyers,
there were troop carriers,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and there were destroyers
to carry small planes.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> While they were
in Antarctica,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
they were supposed to
go there for six months.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:84%
They terminated the
mission after two months.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They went down supposedly for
an exploration/expedition type

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:90%
of thing for Antarctica.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:10%
It's true that that
operation ended abruptly.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.525 align:middle line:10%
It ended ahead of schedule.

00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple of
deaths reported on it.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were rumors that
they had encountered something

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica that basically
chased Admiral Byrd

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.345 align:middle line:84%
and American military
out of Antarctica.

00:14:12.345 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> On his way back to the United
States, they stopped in Chile.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:10%
And in an interview with
the newspaper El Mercurio,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:10%
Admiral Byrd made
a stunning remark.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
He said that in a future
war, the United States

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
was going to have to defend
itself against flying craft

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that could fly from pole to
pole in a matter of hours.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
When that convoy arrived
back in Washington,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd was taken to
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:10%
He was held there
incommunicado for five days.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
He was debriefed
and he was forbidden

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to speak in public
about what had really

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
happened to that operation.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened was after
two months of the operation,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.645 align:middle line:84%
flying saucers came
out of the water.

00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> They were attacked by UFOs
that sank some of their ships,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
shot down some of their planes.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
devastating loss.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> They destroyed one destroyer,
supposedly about 68 marines

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
were killed, and Byrd realized
quickly that if there was no

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:84%
way he could possibly defeat
that kind of an aircraft that

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
could fly darting in and out
20 ships and fly at supersonic

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
speeds.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:90%
His aircraft were much slower.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't possibly
contend with that.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:90%
So he had to leave.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
He turned around and
left in two months

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:90%
after beginning the operation.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
What has to be discussed is
why they set up a colony there

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:10%
Why would they travel 5,000
miles across the Atlantic

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:10%
a year before they were
preparing for a major war

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:10%
and build a colony
there under the ice?

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:10%
They weren't building
that colony as a refuge.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:10%
It was not a place
they expected to go

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:10%
to escape from the war in
Europe because they were very

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.462 align:middle line:10%
confident that point
of winning the war,

00:16:19.462 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:10%
and they had every
reason to be confident

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:10%
because they had tremendous
advantage, both in terms

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:10%
of advantage over England
and advantage over Russia.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The entire antarctic colony was
meant to be a space exploration

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:90%
colony to begin with.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an escape
from World War II.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:10%
The Germans were building
anti-gravity disks as early

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:10%
as 1939-40.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.623 align:middle line:90%
It was alien technology.

00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The Germans could not have
developed that technology

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:90%
by themselves.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And Oberth, one of
the German scientists

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
said that and admitted
it, said we were helped.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:90%
That was his take.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
We were helped.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted the
Antarctic colony

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
to be more of a scientific
space exploration colony.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.939 align:middle line:84%
Their plan was to use that
colony for space exploration.

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There had been a lot of
interesting UFO sightings over

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica recorded
over the years.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Couple of famous
ones in around 1965,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Chilean and British
personnel which

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
were stationed in Antarctica
recorded some very unusual

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
aerial phenomena there
that still hasn't

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%
been explained to this day.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:10%
There's things
going on down there

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:10%
as there are around the
entire world relating to UFOs,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:10%
if it's the case
that Lockheed Martin

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:10%
and other major
aerospace companies

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:10%
are moving to Antarctica.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.743 align:middle line:10%
All right, that's
really the case.

00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's very
interesting, isn't it?

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.327 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask why are
they going down there.

00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
There have been some odd
things in the news concerning

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica right at the end
of the Obama administration.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
John Kerry went to Antarctica.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to ask seriously why.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.377 align:middle line:10%
And then there's Buzz
Aldrin, I believe,

00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:10%
went to Antarctica
around the same time

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:10%
and, yeah, it makes me wonder
what's happening down there.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, that doesn't mean
that it's ET related.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:10%
It could mean that there's
a lot of things going on.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.882 align:middle line:84%
It could be some interesting
scientific anomaly or discovery

00:18:13.882 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that they're making and that
they can make an announcement.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of possibilities
I'm not yet inclined

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to jump up and down and say,
OK, it's a portal, it's ET,

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:90%
it's whatever.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to wait.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But that aside, I
think it's possible

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that there's some other
strange things going on

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%
down in Antarctica.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look, it's remote.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.125 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to do things far
removed from the public eye.

00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So all kinds of things
are possible in there.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> To any skeptic who says,
well, these are just stories.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:10%
These are just accounts.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:10%
How?

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:10%
Life is just stories.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Life is just accounts.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:10%
The entire criminal justice
system, for example,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:10%
is based on
eyewitness testimony.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
When did we stop thinking
eyewitness testimony was

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.097 align:middle line:90%
important?

00:18:56.097 --> 00:19:04.683 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.683 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:10%
>> UFO investigator Anthony
Sanchez published a transcript

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:10%
of his recorded discussion
with the retired US Air Force

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:10%
colonel about what
he called tall, pale,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:10%
humanoids from one of the
planets in one of two solar

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:10%
systems orbiting Zeta
Reticuli 1 and 2,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:10%
which is a binary star system
about 39 light years from

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:10%
Earth.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:10%
It's the one that the
famous Betty and Barney

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:10%
Hill abduction case that
Betty drew under hypnosis.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
A system of trade routes
that involved the place

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
where it was pointed out to
her where our sun is, where

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.975 align:middle line:84%
Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2 have
trade routes with other stars

00:19:49.975 --> 00:19:50.775 align:middle line:90%
in that system.

00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Anthony Sanchez in his
recorded transcript,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the US Air Force colonel,
talks about progenitors--

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that is the word--

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that the progenitors
were and are

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
a tall, some kind of
humanoid intelligence

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that would be the root
source of the humanoids

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
in this solar system.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:10%
The fact that
there was some kind

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:10%
of a war in Zeta Reticuli 1 and
2 a million or more years ago,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and that it was between
the tall, pale, humanoid

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:10%
progenitors and
another lifeform--

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.220 align:middle line:10%
gray humanoids.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And that these two
lifeforms are somehow

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
distributed in this
doubled binary star system

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
of Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And that what the war was about,
according to the US Air Force

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
colonel, is that the tall,
pale humanoids were secretly

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
going to the gray
humanoid planet,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
harvesting genetic material,
going back to their planet

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in the Zeta Reticuli
1 and 2 system,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
creating androids, hybrids,
a variety of slave labor

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:84%
from the genetic material
that the tall humanoids were

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:84%
harvesting from the
short gray planets.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And this word, progenitors,
meaning the original root race

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
behind what's in
this solar system,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:84%
involves the idea that
whatever the history is

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that would explain ancient
artifacts on Mars, on the Moon,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, and perhaps other
bodies in our solar system,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
it's all attributed in the
US Air Force colonel story

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
to these progenitors from
Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and that they were involved
in constructions on Mars,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:84%
on the backside of the Moon,
the interior of the Moon,

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
on our Earth, and probably
other places even yet

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
that we have not

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
been told anything about
publicly or by whistleblowers.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
The colonel says, according to
the grays, the humanoids that

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
got into the war with
the tall, pale humanoids,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to their historical
writings, they

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the progenitor
race came from another star

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:90%
system, Sirius.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:10%
And that they were
chased from there, again,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:10%
by these gray beings and
that they ended up on Mars.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Mars was the closest to their
own planet from the Zeta

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Reticuli 1 and 2 system.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:10%
Mars was the original
place inhabited by them

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system, meaning
they went to Mars first, not

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:10%
to Earth first.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But choosing Mars proved to
be a major miscalculation.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a cataclysmic event,
according to the Air Force

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
colonel, an asteroid hit
that exterminated some

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:90%
or most of the progenitors.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
John Brandenburg, who

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is a nuclear physicist, that
he wrote a 2015 book entitled

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Death on Mars, The Discovery of
a Planetary Nuclear Massacre,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is about the
presence of xenon 129

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere of Mars, which
has led to John Brandenburg's

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
doing even a presentation
at a NASA conference

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
about enough xenon 129
in the Martian atmosphere

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to support the John Brandenburg
hypothesis that there were

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:84%
two hydrogen bonds that exploded
in the northern hemisphere,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a
compression wave that would have

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
annihilated cities and
life in that Cydonia region

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:90%
where there is the big head,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
the big Cydonia pyramid
and other structures that

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
are referred to as
the Cydonian City.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
John Brandenburg thinks
that this explosion

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of bombs in the
northern hemisphere

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:90%
could go back a million years.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:90%
The timeline is not clear.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
But if he is right, this might
explain what whistleblowers

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
have been telling me for the
past approximately 18 months,

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that our government knows from
its own secret investigations

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that the Cydonia region in the
Martian northern hemisphere

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
does in fact have pyramid and
other structures that are made

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
out of a composite
material which

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of a
substance not found

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
in our periodic
table of elements.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:10%
Further, that the
current whistleblowers

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:10%
tell me that the
hieroglyphs and the symbols

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:10%
on the ancient artifacts of Mars
match exactly the hieroglyphs

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:10%
and symbols on ancient artifacts
and pyramids on the backside

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:10%
and interior of our Moon.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And that they match exactly
the hieroglyphs and symbols

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
on ancient artifacts and
pyramids that are under 1

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 to 2 miles
of ice in Antarctica.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:10%
And that the way we have
been getting into Antarctica

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:10%
for the last 15 or so years
has been through submarine

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:10%
into some part of
Antarctica under the water.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> 70% of the Earth is covered
by water and we've only

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:90%
explored 5% of our oceans.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
before we go to the moon

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
or we do anything
else, we would know

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
what's under our oceans,
what's on our own planet.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:10%
So for years, I've
been researching

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:10%
UFOs which are coming
in and out of waterways.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on
actually for centuries.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:10%
The first UFO
documented sighting

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:10%
that was coming in and
out of the water was 1067.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for centuries,

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
long before we had any
capability of any travel

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
underwater, let alone in and
out of the water, which is still

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:90%
difficult for us.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm narrowing it
down section by section,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
waterway by waterway, trying to
discover the best possibilities

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:90%
for an underwater alien base.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I've found military bases,
I've found submarine bases.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of the areas with
all the activity, there

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
just has to be some type of
an alien facility underwater.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
speak to somebody who has

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:90%
been on a nuclear submarine.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.690 align:middle line:84%
He went down to sonar, was
sitting there with his buddy,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and this thing zipped
across the screen.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, what is that?

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, that's
what we call a fast mover.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
This isn't anything
biological and it's

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:84%
way faster than anything
that we have, he said,

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
so it's basically an
underwater unknown.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And we just log it
and stowed away.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see it.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of activity
that comes in and out of lakes

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that's
necessarily a base,

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
but it is a very
good hiding place

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and it might also
be a place where

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:90%
these craft are refueling.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to focus more
on areas like Puerto Rico.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Puerto Rico has more
activity of UFOs

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
coming in and out of the water.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've
understood with my research,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
they're also coming into the
atmosphere through a wormhole

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and then entering the water.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Jorge
Martin who is the expert

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
researcher on USOs and UFOs
in the Puerto Rico area

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and he said, for months now, in
fact, for the past few years,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
the activity is
picking up more now

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:84%
in the last few months
of these craft coming

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:90%
in and out of the water.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually found through
maps underwater anomalies

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that he does believe are
underwater alien bases.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So my research is taking
me to different areas

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to pinpoint the best
possibilities for these bases

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Why these areas,
why not other areas?

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
This research has
led me to Russia,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to the Baltic Sea,
the Mediterranean,

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and even as far as Antarctica.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There's bases possibly
in Antarctica.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing some research
there and it's kind of ironic

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that John Kerry just
came from Antarctica.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
He said supposedly
because it had something

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:90%
to do with the environment.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's just
a little bit far fetched,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:84%
because after he came
back, they announced

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that they have a 35-year
ban on going to Antarctica

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:90%
without permission from the UN.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So what are they hiding there?

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I did some research
through WikiLeaks

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and found out that Julian
Assange had released

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
some documents that were back
from, I believe, from the 1990s

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.110 align:middle line:84%
about some alien craft that
were coming out of the water

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:84%
there in Antarctica
of a fleet of craft.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:10%
So it seems like there's
something going on there

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:10%
that our government
doesn't want us to know

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:10%
and we've started building our
own facilities in Antarctica,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:10%
trying to take
control of the area,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:10%
and possibly share a base
with these alien beings.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
For some reason now, the
three major countries--

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
China, Russia, and
the United States--

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
three major world
powers, they're

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
putting their bases underwater,
their submarine bases,

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:90%
their military facilities.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I've even heard talk about how
they're putting some missile

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.867 align:middle line:90%
sites underneath the water.

00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So they're hiding everything
underneath the water.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to believe, but we've
had submarines since the 1800s.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
went into the 1960s,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
we started building facilities
underwater for research.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:90%
We've built tunnels under water.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We've been building things
under water for years

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and nobody really
looks underwater.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody pays attention.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Everybody looks at land, perfect
place to hide everything.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:10%
As far as alien craft, I
started researching that

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.750 align:middle line:10%
and one in five UFOs
is water related.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.482 align:middle line:84%
With 70% of the Earth
covered by water, of course,

00:30:48.482 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that's where they're
going to hide.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
There's been craft coming in and
out of the water in Michigan,

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the Great Lakes, off
Catalina Island--

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:84%
one of the most active areas
in the Pacific Coast right now.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
They had sightings
actually at Avalon

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
off the Catalina Island
on July 8th 1947.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the same day that
the Roswell Daily Record

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:90%
printed the Roswell crash.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I started
doing some research

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and they had several sightings
a few days before and a few days

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:90%
after the Roswell crash.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was off
of Catalina Island,

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
so these craft were
coming in and out.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, they had just
almost a UFO flap of craft

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that were coming in
and out of the oceans.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
These were being reported right
off of Catalina Island, right

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of California.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Surfers were reporting craft.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Surfers go out early
in the morning.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
They're out with
the crack of dawn

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
before boats and everything
else get out there.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
While they're
watching for a wave,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
they've also seen craft coming
in and out of the water.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:84%
We have lakes all
over the United States

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:90%
where craft come in and out.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm really more
interested in are the bases,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.137 align:middle line:84%
the alien bases that
they have underwater.

00:32:07.137 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It was in 2015 that I got an
email from a man who introduced

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:30.510 align:middle line:10%
himself to me saying that he
had been a naval flight engineer

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:10%
from 1977 to 1997, a 20-year
career of which a good part

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:10%
of it, he was stationed with
other naval people in McMurdo,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:10%
the American base in Antarctica.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered that
around 1995 to 1997,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that he and the crew would
be in a big C-130, maybe

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
a crew of 15, 17 people.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they often would
have assignments

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:84%
where they would have to go
from McMurdo, say up to pole,

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe over to the
Australian camp at Davis

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:90%
on the east side of Antarctica.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.680 align:middle line:10%
And that they would have
navigation going to pole,

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:10%
and when they went
to pole, that meant

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:10%
that they would have to
cross over the Transantarctic

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:10%
Mountains that go
completely across,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.840 align:middle line:10%
almost dividing the big
continent of Antarctica.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, as they would
fly toward the pole,

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:84%
they would get to the same place
every time called the Beardmore

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Glacier.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And half a dozen different
times, they all saw this.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
There would be silver
glinting circular craft.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They would come up over the
Transantarctic Mountains,

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:84%
they would never cross over
into the Beardmore Glacier,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:84%
almost they began
to wonder, is there

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:84%
are some territorial
constriction here.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But they would be in
their C-130 and they

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.980 align:middle line:84%
would see the silver disks
come together in pairs,

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:84%
stop mid-air, one take off,
another go up, go down.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.730 align:middle line:84%
But those silver disks
never came toward the C-130

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and they all began
to notice as a crew

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that they never flew over
that Beardmore Glacier

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and they would joke and
talk among each other.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you
think we've got here?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.210 align:middle line:84%
These UFOs are these
extraterrestrials,

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and is somebody keeping them
on that side of the Beardmore

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Glacier like a joke.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:10%
But there came a moment in '95
to '97 where they got a call,

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:10%
it was a medevac, and it was
somebody over in the Davis Camp

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:10%
on the Australian
far eastern side that

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:10%
had gotten severe burns from
some kind of a kitchen cooking

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:10%
explosion.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
serious, and they

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
knew that they normally would
have a five and a half hour

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:90%
to six hour flight.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to see
if they could cut down

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that time because
of the emergency.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And the captain had talked
with the crew and said,

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
does anybody understand why
we have this no fly zone

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:90%
about 5 miles away from pole?

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
eat up more time.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there any reason why we can't
go through that no fly zone?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
that came back was

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to be air
monitoring station within 5

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:90%
miles of the south pole.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And the captain said, we're
flying at 35,000 feet,

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to be
contaminating air down there.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:84%
This guy over here is
in emergency situation,

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
let's just go through
this no fly zone.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.270 align:middle line:10%
All of the crew is
looking down the window,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:10%
and the man who has contacted
me about all of this

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:10%
that I called Brian S,
said to their astonishment,

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:10%
when they are so
close to what would

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:10%
be the south pole
in this no fly zone,

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:10%
he said it was like a
perfect sort of circle hole

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.490 align:middle line:10%
and it seemed to have a
slant going into it like this

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:10%
was constructed.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
They said the
size, they all said

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
it must be the size
of a football field

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.220 align:middle line:84%
which would be 300
feet in diameter

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:90%
clearly going down into the ice.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, when they got to
Davis and they picked up

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:10%
their medical person and
got it back to McMurdo,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:10%
when they landed, they said
there was a man in a suit

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:10%
and that doesn't
happen in Antarctica

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:10%
unless it's CIA, NSA, DRA,
NRO, Intel or counter-Intel.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are taken
together as a crew

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and the man said to them,
what you saw, at pole,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.480 align:middle line:90%
you did not see.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Not now, not ever, you do
not talk about that hole.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And Brian told me,
there had been rumors

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:84%
but the rumors really
began to increase

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
between 1995 to 1997,
people sitting down

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:90%
at bars or in cafeterias.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Under the ice, near the South
Pole was what people said,

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:84%
did you know that we've
got extraterrestrials

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that are collaborating
with our government

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're down
there in that hole?

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:90%
That was the kind of talk.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, they got an
assignment not too long

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:84%
after seeing that big hole that
a group of National Science

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Foundation people were coming
in from the United States,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:90%
about 15 of them.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And their job would be
to get these scientists

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:10%
into that C-130,
get them to where

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.450 align:middle line:10%
there were going to do the
research, which in this case

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:10%
was Marie Byrd Land on kind
of northwest of McMurdo.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:10%
And they were always used
to flying National Science

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:10%
Foundation people in usually
between September and February,

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:10%
which is the summer
months in Antarctica

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:10%
and it was this period
of time around 1996.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And they picked up
these scientists.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They're in awful lot
of gear, took them

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to where they were going
to do this research,

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.110 align:middle line:90%
dropped them off.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And Brian said the
agreement with scientists

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
was you call every 24
hour period to this number

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that they had in
McMurdo so that we

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.040 align:middle line:84%
know that you're OK, that
there's no medical emergencies,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:90%
or a problem.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said they got back, and
by the fifth, sixth, seventh

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
day, they had not heard
anything from these scientists.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they get the
order, something's wrong.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:90%
So now they go back.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said when they
were approaching,

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:84%
they went in a big circle,
going all around the camp,

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:84%
getting lower and lower with the
idea that if there was anything

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.360 align:middle line:90%
moving-- people, dogs, sleds--

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
anything, that they would
see it either high and then

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.670 align:middle line:90%
come down low.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Literally nothing was moving.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:90%
They landed.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:90%
They checked everything out.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge mystery.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
They went back to McMurdo.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is puzzled.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:10%
And another week
later after that,

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:10%
they get the phone call, same
crew, the scientists are back.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Get the plane over there.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:90%
We got to get them out.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And the guys on the plane are
expecting that these National

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Science Foundation researchers
are going to be, you know,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
clapping their hands
and jumping up and down

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to hear
about whatever it happened,

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and they land, and he said
the scientists were just

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:90%
lined up perfectly still.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:90%
They get ushered onto the plane.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
down on the ground.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single
word, not to anybody.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And the crew are looking at
each other and one of them said,

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:10%
they looked traumatized.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.220 align:middle line:10%
And they had all of this gear,
but the decision apparently

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.330 align:middle line:10%
was that they would get the
scientists out first and get

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:10%
the gear in another flight.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So they get these--

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
he thought there were two
women and the rest men.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Linda,
it was so eerie.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They've been missing
for two weeks,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and he said they looked scared,
they didn't talk to each other,

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.330 align:middle line:84%
they didn't talk to us, and
they kept looking at the ground.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the male
scientists sat on a chair

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and Brian S was sitting on a
jump seat that was looking back

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:84%
at the scientists, and
this one man who sat down,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.030 align:middle line:84%
he said he was close
enough for me to lean over

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I just
extended my hand

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and I said, is there
anything that I can get you?

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And this scientist
never responded,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:90%
kept staring at the floor.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:90%
The plane landed in McMurdo.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The scientists were
whisked away immediately.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.350 align:middle line:84%
They went on another
plane and they

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
heard that they went to
Christchurch in New Zealand,

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:84%
never to be seen
by this crew again.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And then when they were
in the cafeteria talking,

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the words were from somebody who
had some association with what

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:84%
those scientists had
been doing, said, yeah,

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
the rumor is that they came
here to work with what we call

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial,
biological entities down

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in that hole site near pole,
and who knows what happened.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't been gone very long,
and men in suits come again.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And the whole crew
sat down and told,

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:84%
you do not talk about
these missing scientists.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't talk
about any of this.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But Brian said, the
strange thing is, Linda,

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I was never asked to sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So my coming to you in 2015,
I'm not doing anything wrong.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you should
know that in those years

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.630 align:middle line:84%
at least when I was
there in Antarctica,

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
we were seeing silver disks,
we saw that big hole down

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
in the ice that
others rumored was

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the entrance to a collaboration
between what they call

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
biological entities

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and our military, that
there were National Science

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Foundation researchers
who came in a group,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.520 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, and when
we went to pick them up,

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.105 align:middle line:84%
they seem traumatized
like post-traumatic shock.

00:43:34.105 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, that was 2015.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And I did a recorded
interview with Brian

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and he was on Cawston, Earth
Files, and several programs

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and he called me
up in 2016 saying

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like to meet
you, we'd never met,

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:90%
we'd only been on the phone.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're going to
be speaking at the contact

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:84%
conference in Joshua
Tree in California

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I have a nephew in California
who would like to meet and talk

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:84%
with you and I would,
so let's meet a contact.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And the agreement was that
on the very first night

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.560 align:middle line:84%
on Thursday, in
the summer of 2016,

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:90%
that we would go to dinner.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up in a very
noisy Mexican restaurant, lots

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:84%
of tile, it was very noisy
and we even joked, ironically,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:90%
thinking back.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they
got a satellite on us

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or there was a spy
in here, it's going

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.220 align:middle line:84%
to be hard for them to
hear what we have to say.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And we joked about it.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We were there probably
until about 10:30, 11:00.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we left,
it was a warm night

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and we all agreed we wanted
to keep talking about all

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of the various UFO, ET
stuff we were talking about.

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So we went into the
parking lot where

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:84%
they had an SUV that
was parked under a tree

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and we talked for another
couple hours out there

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in that parking lot.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That was Thursday
night, I end up

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of work on Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:90%
morning.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The guys have gone
back to their homes.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking me back
to the airport to leave,

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and I get a call on my iPhone.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is the nephew who was
with us on that Thursday night

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:84%
dinner and he says,
you will never

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.630 align:middle line:84%
believe what happened
with his uncle Brian.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And he says, he got a phone
call this morning at work.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, that meant a lot
because Brian still

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:90%
works in an aerospace context.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't call his office.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:54.980 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't give out that number.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to call him on
his private cell phone.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And he got a phone
call to his office line

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that I then later
learned in talking

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.720 align:middle line:90%
with Brian began this way.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
absolute transcript

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.500 align:middle line:90%
of what Brian said happened.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The voice on the other end of
the line said, is this Brian?

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, who is this?

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't recognize the number
at all coming in on my phone.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
I want to tell you

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that what you have
been talking about,

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.120 align:middle line:90%
you need to stop talking about.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Brian said, well,
what stuff is that?

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And he says, quote, we know
that you were with Linda Moulton

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Howe last Thursday
night and we know

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that you went to dinner at a
Mexican restaurant in Joshua

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Tree.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And we were aware of what you
were talking about with her

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and other people and
that your experience

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that you had when you
were on the ice, when

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:90%
you were in the service.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.450 align:middle line:84%
We do not want you
talking about that.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, we don't want you
talking about the scientists

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.110 align:middle line:84%
that you picked up after being
missing for a couple of weeks.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Brian said, well, how
would you know about that?

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I've only talked
to certain people.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And the voice on the
phone said, well,

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.260 align:middle line:90%
we know pretty much everything.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, just don't be
putting that out there anymore.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Certain people would prefer
that you not talk about that.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And Brian said, well,
I'll consider that.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And the phone clicked dead.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Brian, who is very smart,
looked at the phone

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and did something that
they could do and call--

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.910 align:middle line:84%
it had a number
that he wrote down.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:84%
When he called that
number, it came back

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.880 align:middle line:84%
as the general phone number for
the National Security Agency

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in Fort Meade.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:13.160 align:middle line:84%
That meant, if you just
put it all together,

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that an event in 1995 to 1997, a
series of events which included

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:84%
the disappearing National
Science Foundation

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:30.470 align:middle line:84%
scientists, by 2016 was still
so sensitive that somebody

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in an intelligence agency in
Washington such as the National

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Security Agency would go to
the trouble to somehow connect

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.580 align:middle line:84%
into what was supposed to be
a private aerospace office

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:50.440 align:middle line:84%
number for Brian S, give
a warning based on having

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:55.810 align:middle line:84%
monitored us, something
is in Antarctica

00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that I personally think every
human being on this planet

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
deserves to know
the truth about.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I
can report, as many

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.410 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers who
will come to me

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and tell me their firsthand
experiences, the more.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I hope that I can share.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:21.130 align:middle line:84%
We should not be on planet Earth
with aliens down in Antarctica

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:84%
collaborating with
our government,

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and then having that
same government threaten

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the reporters who are
supposed to be protected

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:84%
by the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Something is wrong.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.885 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what I'm
trying to find out in my work.

00:49:39.885 --> 00:49:43.910 align:middle line:10%
>> If any of this is
true, if one case is true,

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:10%
this is a game-changer.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:49.090 align:middle line:10%
This is a situation where
the skeptics have to be right

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:10%
every day, whether it's UFOs,
alien abductions, hybridization

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.730 align:middle line:10%
program, aliens
among, us whatever.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.760 align:middle line:84%
The skeptics have to
be right every day.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The believers only
have to be right once.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And not only does the world
change, but the world has

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.690 align:middle line:84%
changed, the world is a
fundamentally different place

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:84%
than we believe it to be because
of things happening that are

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:90%
currently hidden to us.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:26.501 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:30.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Elon Musk was a surprise
guest and one of the panels

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:10%
in Austin, Texas at the current
South by Southwest Festival,

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.220 align:middle line:10%
and he told a big crowd, quote,
we are building the first Mars

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.560 align:middle line:10%
or interplanetary
ship right now,

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:10%
and he is referring
to his SpaceX.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll be able
to do short flight, sort

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of up and down flights probably
in the first half of next year.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what will enable
the creation of a base

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:90%
on the Moon and a city--

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.070 align:middle line:90%
these are his words--

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and a city on Mars.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to getting
the Union Pacific

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Railroad across the continent
or ships across the ocean,

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.630 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to try to
get you there and make

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.320 align:middle line:84%
sure there is an environment
in which entrepreneurs

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.900 align:middle line:90%
can flourish.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Then, I think it--

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.280 align:middle line:84%
meaning, getting to
Mars to build a city--

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.690 align:middle line:90%
will be amazing.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder how much
has Elon Musk been

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:34.980 align:middle line:84%
read into the MJ-12
alien UFO program.

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The one that we
have all been trying

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to get to the bottom
of that we know

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.070 align:middle line:84%
began in 1947 with some
kind of an executive order

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.870 align:middle line:90%
by Harry S Truman.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's now 70 years later.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It would seem logical that
Elon Musk has been introduced

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to some real facts
about the alien presence

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.520 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system,
Mars, the Moon, Earth,

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and that it may be part of
the reason why he is working

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:11.400 align:middle line:84%
so hard to get to Mars with
enough cargo and people

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
to actually start, as he
calls it, a city on Mars.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, does he know anything
about the alleged history

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of alien humanoid life on
Mars in this solar system?

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And I hope that you
will keep in your mind

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:10%
this whole huge, big other
possible backstory as we're

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.960 align:middle line:10%
going to get more and
more headlines about Elon

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:10%
Musk getting ready to launch
to Mars with great enthusiasm

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:10%
apparently by
President Donald Trump.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:10%
What do they both know about
ancient archeology on Mars?

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And what happens once
if Elon Musk gets there

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:02.250 align:middle line:84%
with the new pioneers
like the wagon

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:90%
train that went across America?

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He gets there with
settlers and they

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:84%
are able to survive
landing and they actually

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.040 align:middle line:90%
start setting up a city.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.480 align:middle line:10%
Will we, on Earth,
eventually learn

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.920 align:middle line:10%
about the ancient
archeology on Mars

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.680 align:middle line:10%
that matches Antarctica
and the backside

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:10%
and interior of our Moon?

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:33.030 align:middle line:84%
These are big questions in
this revolutionary time.

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I hope that we will be
told some facts and truth.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And we are at a time where
more and more dots seem

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to be coming into
place about the fact

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're heading out in to
space where we've already been

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and that other
intelligences have

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.210 align:middle line:84%
been coming into our solar
system for a very, very

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.010 align:middle line:90%
long time.
