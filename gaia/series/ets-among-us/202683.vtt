00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just a happenstance, a
synchronistic meeting that I am

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:90%
forever delighted that I had.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I was just about to eat lunch
one day at this conference

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and there was a kiosk in the
middle of the hallway where

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I was putting mayonnaise
on a sandwich,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and somebody happened to reach
over me putting mayonnaise

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:90%
on her sandwich.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I looked around
to see who was there,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and she looked at me as I did
a double take, and she said,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Like why are you
looking at me that way?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because, I hope you
don't mind my saying this but,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
you remind me of a hybrid,
and she smiled and she said,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.408 align:middle line:90%
I am a hybrid.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Barbara
Lamb, and I am a long term

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:10%
psychotherapist.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:10%
I've been a licensed
psychotherapist since 1976,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:10%
and then by 1991,
people started coming

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:10%
to me wanting to know about some
of the very unusual experiences

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:10%
they had been
having, experiences

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:10%
with unusual beings appearing
in their bedrooms at night,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:10%
or appearing somewhere
else during the daytime,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:10%
or unusual crafts, usually
circular or disk-shaped crafts,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:10%
following them in a car, and
then the car motor stopping,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:10%
and then little beings
would come to the car

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:10%
and open the doors, even if
they're locked in the car,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:10%
and then take the
person away for a while.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
We call that an abduction.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, I have
had the great privilege

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of regressing almost 2,000
individuals separately

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to their encounters with
extraterrestrial beings.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It may have been happening for
millennia, for all we know,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly has been
happening in the 20th century,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:90%
and now in the 21st century.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
The people all
over the world are

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
being encountered with by
these extraterrestrial beings.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the typical
thing is that when

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
a person has a visit from
an extraterrestrial being

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
or maybe two or
three beings, they

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
are put into a state of
non-awareness and the inability

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:90%
to move.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
People do not like that.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
That usually is quite
frightening for them,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes the person
will simply be aware,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
first of all, of
waking up and there

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is one of those unusual
beings standing there

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
in the room with them
right near the bed.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Now when this is happening, the
person very often feels that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
they cannot move, almost as
if they've been paralyzed.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:84%
They might be able to move
their eyes or maybe their heads,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
but that seems to be about all.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
They also find that they cannot
call out for anybody else who

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
might be nearby, and even if
there is a sleeping partner

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
in the same bed.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
That partner always seems to
be what we call switched off,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and that means the partner
seems to be so deeply

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
asleep that they can't be
awakened by the person who is

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
about to have this encounter.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, it seems
like they are often levitated,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:84%
lifted up, right from
the bed, sometimes right

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
through the wall with
the other being or beings

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and into a craft.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems like the
craft moves much further away

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
so as not to be seen by
other people in the area.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So that is the typical
beginning of an encounter

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
or what many people
call abductions.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Now in these experiences
onboard the craft,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
so many different
kinds of things

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:90%
happen to various people.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
As I said, these beings
of different types

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
all seem to have their own
agenda for coming and taking

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
this particular person.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:90%
These encounters usually last--

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.555 align:middle line:84%
could be a half an
hour, could be an hour,

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
or could be two hours.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while even longer
than that, and then the person

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is floated back down to
Earth and returned usually

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to the place that they
were removed from.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very mysterious
process that happens,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and we are hearing
more and more about it

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
as more and more experiencers
of this phenomenon

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
are coming forward and
feeling a little bit more

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
free, a little bit
more comfortable

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
in telling other people
about these encounters

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
that they have had.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It has been a
fascinating journey.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I have learned so
much, and I have

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
grown hugely in my
awareness of the cosmos,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
not only the planets and
the stars and the galaxies,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but the beings living on some of
those stars and planets in some

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
of those galaxies.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Because many different
types of extraterrestrials

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
seem to be involved in
our program of coming here

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to planet Earth, they may
very well go to other planets

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
for all I know, but
we do know that they

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
do come frequently
to planet Earth

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and to visit certain people.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Not all people get visited
by extraterrestrials,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:90%
but many people do.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:10%
It's been estimated by polls
that 8 million Americans are

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:10%
affected by these
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I
said, the phenomenon

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
is going on all over
the world, so there

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
are many more millions
of people who are having

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial contacts.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
different species

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of what we refer to as
extraterrestrial beings.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
They come from many different
planets, as far as we can tell.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
There are quite
a few species who

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
have participated in this
hybridization project

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
with the hybrids whom I
know and meet the hybrids.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we have
human-like races,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
like some of the Nordic looking
races and the Pleadian races,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and they are very high in
intelligence and morality

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and even in spirituality.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So those hybrids right
from the beginning

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
could pass much more easily
as humans here on Earth.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:10%
In great contrast to that,
we have little gray aliens,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:10%
and they are more known for
doing examinations of people

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:10%
and even dissecting
tissue samples of people

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:10%
and creating hybrids.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes those beings are said
to come from Zeta Reticuli.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Reptilian beings,
we're sort of surprised

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that they can combine
reproductively

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
because they're
reptile types, but they

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
do combine genetically
with human beings,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and those hybrids are
sort of unusual looking.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
They may look quite
human in a way,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and yet they have the
unusual skin and unusual eyes

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:90%
that the reptilian has.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:10%
And some of the reptilian
beings are very benevolent, very

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:10%
kind hearted actually
wonderful beings that we

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:10%
would be pleased to know.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a species
called Blue Arturians, who

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
are beautiful, tall,
slender, blue beings,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and they have no hair.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They have beautiful
faces that in some ways

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
we could say are very
similar to human faces,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
but obviously,
they're not humans,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and they are very spiritually
advanced, benevolent,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
kindly beings.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the mantis
beings, very, very tall beings.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
They're often seen to
be 8 feet tall sometimes

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
9 feet or 10 feet tall,
like huge, tall insects

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
with great big wrap around
eyes and very narrow chins.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes are referred to
as insectoids and etherent

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
beings who are not
even densely physical,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
as we are, but are definitely
really intelligent,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:90%
high spiritual beings.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So these beings have contributed
genetics to these hybrids

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and have frequent
visits with them.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
With all the different
kinds of procedures

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
do, including

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
some very positive things
that they do with people,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, such
as healing the person

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and teaching the
person healing skills,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
so they can heal others
back here on Earth,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
as they teach them telepathic
skills and teleportation

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:90%
skills.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So many children
are put into what

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
seems like a classroom type
of setting onboard the craft,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and they have extraterrestrial
adults there and sometimes,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
children with them

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and other human
abducted children.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
human children are

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
taught how to move
things with their minds.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So they'll start with
something very simple,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
like moving a very small
feather put on the floor.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And one child after
the other will

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
take a turn of focusing
their eyes on that feather

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if they can
move the feather just

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:90%
by thinking of it's moving.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:84%
When they are all able to move
the feather with their minds,

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
then they're given the task
of moving a piece of paper

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:90%
with their minds.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they've
accomplished that,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
they may be given the
task of moving a paper

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
clip, and gradually, a
pencil and objects gradually

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
that are a bit heavier and
more difficult to move simply

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
by looking at it and
focusing their mind on it.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Then as these children
get older and have

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:10%
more extraterrestrial
experiences,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:10%
then they are often downloaded
with very interesting

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:10%
information, sometimes
when they're on the ship

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes when they're
asleep or even driving

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:10%
in a car.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, being rather quiet
and not talking with somebody.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So that downloading seems
to be happening a lot.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I know of some adults
who are engineers,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and when they are busy
working on a highly technical

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
engineering project,
they are receiving

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
downloads of the information
into their brains.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And we also know
of the rare person

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
who works in very complicated
engineering projects involving

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
space travel and all kinds of
difficult challenges like that,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and they are downloaded
by another person

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
in the room, who may be
actually an extraterrestrial.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And those human looking
extraterrestrials

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
give the engineer
just the missing piece

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're needed
for that invention

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're busy trying
so hard to figure out.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up another
aspect that we believe

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are some
beings from other planets

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
who look very human and doing
some very intelligent jobs

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:90%
amongst us.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:10%
In addition to knowing about
many, many different procedures

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:10%
that these beings do with
the people they have taken,

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:10%
they also have a reproduction
program going on.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
That is, a program of
creating hybrid babies who

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
grew up to be hybrid
children, and then

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
eventually hybrid adults.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
extraterrestrial hyphen human

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.525 align:middle line:90%
hybrid beings.

00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
The beings start up
by creating hybrids

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
who are one-half
extraterrestrial and one-half

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
human, and then they want to
create further generations

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
of those hybrids.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
different stages of hybrids.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:10%
We have the very early
stages, half ET, half human,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and then a middle
stage where there's

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:10%
more human component
involved, and then

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:10%
we have late stage hybrids,
who seem to be mostly human,

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:10%
but they still do
have a good portion

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial in them.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of those hybrids,
as far as we can tell,

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
do live on Earth.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia, one of our
hybrids, I never

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
saw her change into her
full reptilian form,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
but we were having
a conversation

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
with a few other people,
and I said, Cynthia,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
do you feel anything
different about your eyes?

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
yeah, well, I feel

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:90%
a little pressure in my eyes.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Why do you ask?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because
I'm seeing them change

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
into the vertical
slits because she

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
had reptilian genetics in her.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, good, and
she rushed into the ladies room

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:84%
so she could look in
the mirror and see

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:90%
that happening for herself.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The earlier stage hybrids
cannot live on Earth

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not human enough,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and they would not be able
to withstand our bacteria

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:90%
and our viruses.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Nor would they be accepted
very well by human beings

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
because they really look
substantially different.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They would probably be
considered rather freakish,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
so they do not come here.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
They remain on their
ships, sometimes

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
helping with procedures

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
that the other beings are doing.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes my clients
in regression work

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
have said that they
are in a spacecraft

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
with the
extraterrestrials, and they

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
will see in the background,
maybe across the room,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
they will see people that
look human at first glance,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and they'll think, oh, good,
there's some other people here.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one amongst
these unusual looking beings.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
look more closely

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
at what they thought
were human beings,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
they realize, hm, they're
a little different.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
They're not maybe quite
human and those are actually

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:90%
the hybrids it turns out.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So there is a very
vast hybrid program

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
going on between
extraterrestrial beings

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:90%
and human beings.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We might wonder, well, who are
the humans involved in this?

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a
way to think of it

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
is, who are the parents
of these hybrid beings?

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not just anybody that
this seems to happen to.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
The beings seem to be very
interested in certain families.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They like to follow a
genetic line from generation

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to generation.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So an individual
in life who comes

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to the realization at
some point or other

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that they are having
these experiences,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
they may not have
really been aware

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that anyone else
in their family,

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
any of those generations, have
been having experiences too.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But when they start
really thinking about it,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:84%
they think, well, my mother used
to talk about having nightmares

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:90%
of unusual beings in the room.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And if that mother
is still living

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and the person starts
asking questions,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
they might conclude after
a while that, oh, I see.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I never knew it
before, but my mother

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
has been having these
counter experiences also.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
The same with
grandparents or aunts

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
or uncles of the
experiencers, or the children

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:84%
sometimes report being very
frightened during the night

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
or having somebody
come out of the closet.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
They describe it as a
little man or a friend.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes children
like those visits

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
from the small
extraterrestrial beings,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes a
child would say, oh,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
there's a monster in the
room, and they may call out.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But the parents may be
switched off, out of awareness,

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and not even hear the
child calling out.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Or the parent might go into
the bedroom of the child,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, that
being has disappeared.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It is thought sometimes that
maybe some of these beings

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
are interdimensional and
they can pop in quickly

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
from another dimension, then
they could equally quickly

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
pop out of our
physical dimension

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and into their dimension, where
we don't see them anymore.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:10%
And many children remember
being taken aboard a craft

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and being shown around
this miraculous place

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:10%
with curved walls and round
rooms and unusual lighting.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
One woman, whom I regressed
to when she was a child,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
she was told if she was free to
walk along the hallways, which

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
were very large and curved,
but she was always told

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
don't ever touch the walls
because they would harm you.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:84%
They're full of so much energy,
and indeed, to the child,

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like those
walls of the hallway

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:90%
were alive in some way.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole
craft was alive.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The walls seemed to
have life in them,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's reported by a
number of adults as well.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So it can be a very exciting
experience to some children

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and some children experience
it all in a very much

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.225 align:middle line:90%
more frightening manner.

00:23:02.225 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It seems quite a complex
process and yet it

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:90%
works amazingly well.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:10%
So as I mentioned with
the little gray beings,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:10%
a number of the species will
take eggs from the human woman,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:10%
and they will do that
through the navel

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:10%
or they just puncture through
the wall of the abdomen close

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:10%
to the ovary and
remove the eggs.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes they
remove the eggs

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
by going up through the
vagina and into the ovary.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And then males also
have these experiences

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
where sperm is removed from
them by the extraterrestrials

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and used in creating
a hybrid mixed

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:90%
with their genetic material.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And that again gets
implanted on another occasion

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
into a human woman, who
will gestate that embryo

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.420 align:middle line:90%
for up to three months.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes a human male is
taken onboard the craft

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and ushered into a room with
an extraterrestrial female

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:10%
and they will mate together
and that female again

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:10%
would have to have a womb and
the right apparatus internally.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
She will carry
the baby full term

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and give birth to that baby,
who will remain on the craft.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a hybrid male will
mate with a hybrid female

00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:84%
so that offspring will
have a lot of hybrid in it

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and even a little bit
more human component.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Another method is that
a human female will

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
be taken onto the
ship and she will

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
be artificially
impregnated with material

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:90%
from an extraterrestrial.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, she'll be
impregnated with material

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
from a few extraterrestrials
so that hybrid will not only

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
be part ET but part a variety
of extraterrestrials and humans.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
One of our hybrids has
said that the ETs have

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
contributed genetics from 89
different extraterrestrial

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Each of these hybrids became
a hybrid in a different way.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
Cynthia was created

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
because her father
was participating

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
in a special government
project where

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:84%
they were experimenting
to see if they

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
could create ET human hybrids.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So this was definitely a
scientific experimentation.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So what this father
did was to drug

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
a mother on one
celebratory occasion,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and she became unconscious,
and he had arranged for her

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to be taken, abducted,
by humans who

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
put a little embryo
into her body

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that they had already made
up from eggs previously taken

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
from her ovaries and sperm
taken from him, the father,

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and then a mixture of
about six different types

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial genetics.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I've known of cases too
with some of my clients

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
that a human woman would be
sleeping in her bed at night

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and an extraterrestrial
male will come here

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
for a brief time,
visit her in the room,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:84%
coming right through the walls
or through the closed window,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and combines sexually
with her, and then she

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:84%
becomes pregnant with
that hybrid embryo, which

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is later taken by
those same beings

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to be in the gestation
tank on the ship

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and raised on the ship.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
There have been quite
a number of reasons

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
given by the extraterrestrials
for why they create hybrids.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
This material has all
come from the regressions

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I've done with the experiencers
who have been involved

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
in the reproductive program.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So the first reason given
by a number of these species

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is that they create
the hybrids in order

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to save their dying
race, and they give

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%
reasons for why they are dying.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
One group said that they
have become too inbred

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
with their own kind,
and therefore, they've

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
been weakened by
all that inbreeding.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:10%
So that's gone on for thousands
of years, maybe even millennia,

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:10%
for all we know.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
beings say that they

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:90%
can no longer reproduce.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Their females have
become infertile

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:90%
over very long periods of time.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, their race
is going to be dying out.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Some say that they
have lost their ability

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to reproduce because they
have been harmed by radiation.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean from
nuclear bombs, but simply

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:10%
from the radiation of traveling
through space, and bit by bit,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:10%
they get to irradiated to be
able to reproduce offspring.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the mistakes
that they made

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:84%
was in doing a good deal
of genetic engineering

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to tweak certain aspects
of their genetics.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They have done so much
cloning so frequently

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
over such a long period of
time that they have actually

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
lost the ability to
reproduce naturally.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
They know that we humans
do reproduce naturally.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:84%
They would like to regain
that ability in their hybrids.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ETs have said
that they create hybrids

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because they want
their beings to be

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:90%
more substantial physically.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have become
very small, very thin,

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
very weakened, and they
see us human beings

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
as being much more hearty, much
more substantial, much more

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
muscly and able to do
so much more physically.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of the beings
have said that they

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
would like their hybrids to
have the component of emotion

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that humans have to be
able to have compassion.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So many of those species have
nothing even vaguely resembling

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:90%
what we experience as love.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So they may have
concern for each other,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
especially for their
offspring, but they

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
don't experience what
they see that we have,

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
which we call love.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So another group
has said that they

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:84%
would like to genetically
reincode humans

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.530 align:middle line:90%
to live in more balanced ways.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:10%
By balanced ways, they mean
less hostile, less greedy,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:10%
less war-like and more
balanced, more kindly.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Another group of
beings said that they

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
are hoping to perpetuate
the human race in case

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:90%
our planet becomes unlivable.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:84%
An electromagnetic
catastrophe will

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
happen on Earth resulting
from your negative technology

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that you have already developed,
and it will be misused

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and it will cause
wide spread disasters.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So you need hybrid
beings amongst you

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:84%
who could carry on
living elsewhere.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Another group wanted
to create beings

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:22.080 align:middle line:84%
who would be part human and
part extraterrestrial so

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that these beings could
sometimes live on our planet

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
like ambassadors understanding
the extraterrestrials in a way

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can't really
understand them

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.180 align:middle line:90%
and also understanding humans.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
ETs could not do that, but
hybrids big partly human

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.190 align:middle line:84%
would be more likely
to be able to be

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
here long enough
for periods of time

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to sort of ease
into human society.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Not to take over human
society, but to live amongst us

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and really experience what
that's like by staying here

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:90%
for long periods of time.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's no doubt
about the fact

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that these hybrids are here
for benevolent service.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are very wonderful
benevolent species out there,

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of the
species that come here

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:90%
and that are more self-serving.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But these hybrids
come from the really

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
benevolent, highly-evolved,
spiritually-oriented beings,

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and they would like
to see us evolve

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:84%
enough to justify being
members of the great galactic

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.630 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So how do humans react
to having hybrid babies

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:90%
and hybrid children?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.850 align:middle line:90%
That varies a lot.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:10%
Some women, when
they are presented

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:10%
with a hybrid baby
onboard the craft

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:10%
and told that it's
their baby, they're

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.610 align:middle line:10%
horrified because it
looks very strange.

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like
a normal human baby.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They just don't want
anything to do with it.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet, always the
extraterrestrials

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
insist that the woman would hold
that baby and nurture the baby,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully even
love the baby.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Some women are horrified,
but some women actually

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:90%
take to that quite naturally.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
maternal instinct,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and even though
the baby looks may

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:84%
be sickly or not quite right or
not attractive enough, not cute

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.820 align:middle line:84%
like our babies
do, that she'll be

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
able to really feel a loving
feeling and nurturing feeling

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and hold and rock the baby,
and really give it some love.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's explained
to these women

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:84%
that these hybrid infants
have to have some love

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and nurturing from
a human mother

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
because without that they
just would not survive.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there were a
number of experimentations

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
with having hybrid
babies, and they did not

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:84%
make any effort to have the
human mother come on board

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and nurture the baby, and
those hybrid babies all died.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with
men too, that they

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:84%
want the little hybrid
child to at least have

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
a sense of a human father,
somebody else really related

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.260 align:middle line:84%
to them from the
human population.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Because, after
all, these hybrids

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.900 align:middle line:84%
are going to grow up
on the ship and know

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:84%
only the extraterrestrials
who are on that ship.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And some mothers are
shown their hybrid baby,

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and they love the
hybrid baby, even

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
though the baby looks quite
unusual from our point of view.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And they continue to have
visits with the hybrid baby.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Some women I know have
hybrid children who

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:90%
are as old now as in their 20s.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And on occasion, the woman is
taken and still has a chance

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to know that hybrid child.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Now some of those
mothers really want

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to have these further
abductions so that they

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.810 align:middle line:90%
can see the hybrid child again.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of these mothers
have many hybrid children.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I know a woman who has
34 hybrid children.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:84%
She did not even know until
she was told that in one

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:90%
of the encounter experiences.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Another woman I
know has been told

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that she has 22 hybrid children,
and these two women really

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:84%
wish that they could have
those children on Earth

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
or at least see them frequently
and sort of follow them

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
through their growing
up experiences.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed nine people who
we understood were hybrids.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them actually have
some physical differences

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of us humans.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:84%
For instance, one of the
hybrids has a different bone

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:90%
consistency.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It's much harder and
firmer, tougher, stronger

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.380 align:middle line:90%
than our bones.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Another one has a
different blood type

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of us
humans don't have.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Two of them have different
internal organs that

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
are misplaced in their bodies.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, organs
that would usually

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
be in the lower abdomen are now
up here in the chest somewhere.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
In one case, the hybrid
woman has thumbs that

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:90%
really spread out at the end.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So the points of the
thumbs were much wider

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
than any of the thousands
of the rest of us.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.180 align:middle line:84%
People who hear about
these hybrids immediately

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
want to know, oh, have they
been genetically tested?

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
These particular
hybrids have so far

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:05.590 align:middle line:84%
declined to be genetically
tested, primarily because all

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic testing
labs are mandated

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to send the results
of each genetic test

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to a particular department
of our government.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So all of our
hybrids, who we know,

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
always felt very, very different
from everybody around them.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Even different from everybody
in their own family.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
They always felt like they
were from somewhere else.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They were from out
there somewhere.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
That their real
family was out there

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:84%
rather than their Earth
mother and father,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and these people were
frequently having contacts

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:84%
with their
extraterrestrial beings,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:90%
whom they have the genetics of.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, a
way we could think of it

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:10.770 align:middle line:84%
was that they had many, many ET
visits here and many abductions

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to the spaceships.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't think
of them as abductions

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
because they felt
like the beings who

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
came for them and the beings
on the ships they were taken to

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:90%
were their true family.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So they became aware
of their ET lineage.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
That is, they were told by
their extraterrestrial beings

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that in many, many,
many lifetimes,

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:48.420 align:middle line:84%
they had already been
those species of beings.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:90%
They had been extraterrestrials.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of these
hybrids are a mixture

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of more than one
extraterrestrial species.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So a hybrid isn't just like part
hybrid, part gray alien or part

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.190 align:middle line:84%
human and part
Andromedan, but they

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.600 align:middle line:84%
might be quite a different
grouping of beings

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
all in one with the
predominant one big human.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, there are
some real disadvantages

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%
of being a hybrid on Earth.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Often, these hybrids
have allergies

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to different foods and different
substances that we have here,

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's from the
extraterrestrial component.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have immune system
problems, respiratory problems.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They often have boundary issues.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
difficult for them

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to let other humans get
really, really close to them.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have needed
repeated encouragement

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and use
their psychic skills

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and their telepathic
skills and their healing

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
skills, because they know that
certain people around them

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:84%
just think they're weird or
that they're uncomfortable.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
have the difficulty

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of being harassed by
unmarked helicopters.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have visits
from men in black,

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:90%
which they do not welcome.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are taken
to underground bases,

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and they have testing
done with them

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.570 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of different ways.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're very,
very sensitive to what

00:42:54.150 --> 00:43:00.470 align:middle line:84%
goes on in the world, especially
all the negative things.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:84%
They just don't understand
why people lie to each other

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.090 align:middle line:84%
or why they hurt
each other or why

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.110 align:middle line:84%
there are wars between
one country and another,

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:90%
why everything is so divided.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Why we have polarities,
different political parties,

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
one country lording it
over another country.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Even at school, you have the
good students and the slower

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
students and you have the
popular kids and the left out

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.240 align:middle line:90%
kids.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
goes on and on when

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.410 align:middle line:84%
you think of almost every
aspect of our human life,

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and these hybrids always thought
that's so wrong because they

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.620 align:middle line:84%
have learned from their
extraterrestrial beings

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.485 align:middle line:90%
that all of us are one.

00:43:55.485 --> 00:44:06.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
many blessings

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that they consider about
being a hybrid on Earth.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:18.140 align:middle line:84%
These hybrids are very
intelligent, intuitive,

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:84%
very psychic, and they all have
a much broader appreciation

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
of the whole cosmos.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Their scope is so much more
enormous than most of ours is,

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and they like having the special
abilities to help other people.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are very
good at medical intuition

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and knowing totally
accurately what's

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:51.850 align:middle line:84%
going on inside
somebody's body and what

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:90%
a certain problem is all about.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
use their skills

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
to heal that other person.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:84%
They enjoy their telepathic
skills sometimes, too.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Being able to do special
things like move things

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:84%
with their minds
and levitate things,

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and they don't do it in
front of most people,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:84%
but they're fortunate that they
have a friend whom they can

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:90%
freely use those skills with.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of them had
animal communications,

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.210 align:middle line:84%
telepathic communication, being
able to communicate things

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to the animal and hear back
accurately from the animal.

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:10%
A couple of them had the
ability of bi-location,

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:43.330 align:middle line:10%
being in different
places at the same time.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Each of these hybrids
has had the experiences

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of astral traveling, which
has seemed very natural out

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of the body experiences,
and they went far and wide,

00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:00.850 align:middle line:84%
even to other dimensions
and to other planets

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and other spaceships in some
of their astral travels.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
them shape shift.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They really completely
throughout their whole bodies

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%
change form.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do
channeling, some of them

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
even channel from
deceased persons

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.375 align:middle line:84%
bringing useful messages
through from the departed.

00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:84%
The common mission that they
all have has a few components.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:84%
One is to help humanity
to be aware of the reality

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Probably it's fair to say
that most humans do not

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:84%
understand or believe
or trust that there

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:84%
are extraterrestrial
beings of different types

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:05.800 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Part of their mission is to
help people become acquainted

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.370 align:middle line:84%
with that part of reality
that the others do exist

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and that the others come here
for brief periods of time.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:23.870 align:middle line:84%
They are here to help
understand that there

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is a multitude of
extraterrestrial beings,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.650 align:middle line:84%
not just the little green
men that people talk about,

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:38.470 align:middle line:84%
or the little gray aliens, but
many, many different types.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:84%
They like to have
people begin to know

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.470 align:middle line:84%
about interdimensional
beings, and many

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of what we consider
extraterrestrials

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:84%
certainly seem to
be interdimensional.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they can appear
to be solid and physical,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes they
seem to just to retreat

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:07.620 align:middle line:84%
into a different dimension,
and we cannot see them at all.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do very
accurate channeling

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:16.640 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial beings and
giving us a lot of perspective

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.670 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrial's
points of view.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Perspective on all of
reality and also about what's

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.560 align:middle line:90%
happening on Earth.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And they are here to
help inspire humans

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to protect each other and to
help to protect and preserve

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:84%
all life on Earth, as well as
to preserve the Earth itself.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So these hybrids
are here to help

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
to raise human consciousness.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Even the late wonderful
Dr. John Mack,

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:84%
psychiatrist at Harvard
University and teacher

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
of psychiatrists, who did
so much wonderful regression

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.830 align:middle line:84%
work with experiences of
extraterrestrial contact

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and brought that into many
more people knowing about it,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:19.010 align:middle line:84%
he said something very
important I think.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:24.440 align:middle line:10%
After destruction of
the Earth and of humans,

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.280 align:middle line:10%
hybrids will be placed in groups
in many parts of the Earth

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:10%
to live as a new civilization
with a new system of knowledge

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:10%
and ways from another world.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:90%
