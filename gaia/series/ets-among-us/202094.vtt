00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the greatest
story in human history.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.840 align:middle line:10%
It's never been told.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:10%
It must be told, and it
will be told eventually.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And if we can wake people
up to realize who they are

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%
and why they're here,
that'll be a good beginning.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
We have had an intimate
interrelationship

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
with advanced intelligence
from the stars

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
of human history,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and that intimate
interrelationship

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:90%
is still under way.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.415 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:39.415 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We're living in a very
little circumscribed fence,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
a little fence of reality, and
we're supposed to live within

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
But there's a world
beyond that little fence

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:10%
that we're being
told to live in,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:10%
and I think that there's a lot
going on beyond that fence.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.022 align:middle line:84%
The real question is, how much,
how far advanced are they,

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:90%
what the hell are they doing?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
>> When we talk about
extraterrestrials,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:10%
there are a number of different
theories about what's going

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
on, and there are a number of
different possibilities if any

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:10%
of this is true,
what's happening.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, here are some thoughts.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They might be coming
here as conquerors.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
What we are seeing
might be some sort

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of advanced protracted
reconnaissance program aimed

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
at assessing our
capability to fight back,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.108 align:middle line:84%
and maybe genetically
modifying us maybe.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
hear a lot of people

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
talk these days about
genetically targeted

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:90%
bioweapons.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
What if the purpose of the
alien abduction phenomenon

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
was to implant in us a
genetically targeted bioweapon

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that at a flick of a switch
would wipe us out or enslave

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
us or reduce us to
malleable creatures

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
who would do the bidding
of these extraterrestrial

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:90%
conquerors?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility is that
they come here as explorers.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
That might be a good thing, or
as we've seen in human history,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
it might lead to
exploitation of the natives.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
This time, the natives
are us, human beings.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It might lead to things
like missionaries

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and forced conversion to
some bizarre alien religion.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of speculation.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
might be out there.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes when
you look at the world,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
you can't understand why
certain countries or people do

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:90%
the things they do.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
If we can't understand
with any real confidence,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
say, the motivation of the
North Korean government

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
because we can't get
inside their heads,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
what hope have we
got of understanding

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:90%
the mindset of an alien?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
We can only come
at this question

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
from anthropocentric
viewpoint, and we are forever

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
going to be hamstrung by
that lack of imagination.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It is literally inconceivable.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:10%
We cannot think like an alien
because we don't know what

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:10%
an alien is and what an
alien is motivated by.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:10%
So that's the situation.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We might be dealing
with conquerors.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We might be dealing
with explorers

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
who might then become exploiters
of resources, including us.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We might be dealing-- and I hope
this is where we are on this

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%
spectrum--

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
with scientists,
and particularly--

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
well, scientists who might
be studying us, biologists.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps UFOs and visiting aliens
are the equivalent of someone

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:90%
like David Attenborough.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
"Here on planet
Earth, I'm having

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
a look at these funny little
humans and what they're up to."

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's one possibility.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility
is that we're

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
dealing with that branch of
science that is particularly

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
predicated on looking at
humans and human society,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
anthropologists.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe extraterrestrials
come here

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
as anthropologists, which
would explain why they don't

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:90%
land on the White House lawn.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Because once you start openly
interacting and communicating,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you're not seeing us
in our natural habitat,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're not seeing
natural behaviors anymore.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:90%
You get cultural contamination.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they
study us from afar.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they abduct the odd
person and put them back

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and try and wipe their
memories, and some people

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:90%
believe them and some not.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, don't land
on the White House lawn

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
because then you get
that contamination.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And to truly advanced
civilizations in the cosmos,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
newly emerging
civilizations like our own

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
might just be the
last interesting thing

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
left in the universe.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps we are fascinating
to them on that level.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Who are these crazy humans?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.462 align:middle line:90%
What are they up to?

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
What are they building?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
What do we think
their journey will be?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's follow them.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
When we speculate about
extraterrestrials, my goodness,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine a wide
range of possibilities.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But my favorite theory is that
the real answer, what aliens

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
are doing, where they
come from, what they want,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
what the interaction is,
maybe the real answer

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.802 align:middle line:84%
is something we haven't
even thought of yet.

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:16.217 align:middle line:90%

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I have a question
for all Americans.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:10%
Where did all the money go?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Why has our economy
bottomed out?

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Was it by chance?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Was it by accident?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Was it by mistake?

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:10%
There is something called the
"Secret Space Program," which

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:10%
was an outgrowth of the
discoveries in the 1940s

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:10%
and 1950s of crashed UFO
craft that were recovered.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The first recovery that I
know of occurred in 1940.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It was not Roswell.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Seven years before
Roswell, an alien craft

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
crashed in Port
Girardeau, Missouri.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
The local townspeople saw
the crash, came upon it,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and pulled out the pilots.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And these were such good
Christian and God-fearing

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
people that even though they
recognized that the pilots were

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
foreign, they called a
minister to come and administer

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the last rites to
these poor creatures.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And a certain Reverend Huffman
was called, and he took off.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:84%
He met the chief of police, and
he saw the body of an alien.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the army came in
and took over the scene.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:90%
They took the craft.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:90%
They took the body.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:90%
That was 1940.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, we all know
about the Roswell crash,

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
but there were two
other crashes that year,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
one in Kingman,
Arizona, and an earlier

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:90%
one that occurred in April.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
These craft were recovered.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So this resulted in
a spurt of activity

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:90%
to reverse-engineer these craft.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
There was an official
investigation

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:90%
that was called Project Sign.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
This was the first investigation
into the Roswell crash.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And the conclusion
of Project Sign

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:10%
was that we were being visited
by people from outer space that

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:10%
had a higher level of
civilization and technology

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:10%
than we did.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But when this report arrived
in Washington to the Chairman

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Hoyt S. Vandenberg,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
he said, we cannot
accept this conclusion.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:90%
Write another paper.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that paper was quashed,
and Project Grudge was

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
initiated, which evolved
into Project Blue Book,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep track
of UFO activities,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
UFO interaction
with human beings,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and at the same
time, to cover it up,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
which is what Project
Grudge and Project Blue Book

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
were primarily assigned to do.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:10%
Catalog all the UFO events,
the sightings, the landings,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:10%
the evidence, procure it
all, silence the witnesses.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that went on
for a very long time.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:84%
However, during the
same period of time,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
UFO activity increased
throughout the United States.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's well known that
they have had incursions

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
into our military bases,
our nuclear facilities,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
that they track
nuclear submarines,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and that they have a very great
concern with nuclear weapons

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and what human beings
intend to do with them.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
are guardian angels

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and then others are not
such guardian angels.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were obviously,
during the 1950s and '60s,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to lure the United
States and the Soviet Union

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
into war with each other.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:90%
So there we have it.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We have one faction
of aliens that

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
wants to pit mankind
against itself

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to
destroy ourselves

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
through self-immolation
and a nuclear holocaust.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, there's
another group of aliens

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:10%
that's showing
itself as guardians,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:10%
protectors of humankind
at other times,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:10%
but also giving stern warnings
that should we ever be

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:10%
so foolish as to launch a
nuclear missile at another

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:10%
country, we cannot be sure
where that missile will land.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
The Secret Space
Program evolved out

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
of this, the need for secrecy,
hiding the facts of UFO

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and flying saucer activity.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
having to play catch-up

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:10%
with a civilization that was
so far ahead of us that it was

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:10%
feared that if its
presence were revealed,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:10%
the Brookings Institution said
that the scientists, doctors,

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:10%
and engineers of our society
would be so depressed,

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:10%
so despondent with
the futility of having

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:10%
to catch up with a
civilization that

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.820 align:middle line:10%
was at least 200 years
ahead of us, that they would

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:10%
be so disheartened that
they might not even get up

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:10%
to go to work the next morning.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And that is it in a nutshell.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a statement in the
Brookings Institution report,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that science and society
would be destabilized

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:90%
by such a revelation.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
However, the military
industrial complex

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
was not destabilized
by any means.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:10%
They were very
stabilized and got

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:10%
to work on reverse engineering
the products extracted

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:10%
from the crashed UFOs.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This story can be read
in Philip Corso's book

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:90%
"The Day After Roswell."

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:10%
Fiber optics, the
maser, the laser,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravitational propulsion,
all of these things

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:10%
were found in the
crashed Roswell

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:10%
disc, the crashed
Aztec flying saucer,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:10%
and several others that have
been recovered since that time.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So the United States government
got to work alongside Canada,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and the funding was funneled
to the Secret Space Program.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And trillions and trillions
of dollars were invested,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and these trillions and
trillions of dollars

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:90%
had to come from somewhere.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, many
government programs

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%
engaged in black operations.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.335 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've all
heard of many years

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:10%
ago there was an audit
done the United States Air

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:10%
Force and the United
States military,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:10%
and they were finding that
the contractors were charging

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:10%
the United States government
$1,500 for a hammer,

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:10%
$500 for a toilet seat.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that this
is the methodology where

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
all of this money was skimmed
off and hidden and funneled

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:84%
into this advanced, very
rapid development program

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to try to catch up with the
UFOs to build our own UFOs based

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
on their reverse-engineer
technology,

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and we have been successful.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we have something
called the Navy's Tenth Fleet.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:10%
It's masked as a cyber
warfare organization, software

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:10%
and computer related.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
However, the Navy
Tenth Fleet is the name

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
of a space fleet, which
was discovered, by the way,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
by Gary McKinnon.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
When he hacked into
the NASA computers,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
he saw the list of Tenth Fleet
non-terrestrial officers.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
There were terrestrial
officers, and there was a list

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of non-terrestrial officers.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Gary McKinnon made
this publicly known,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and he suffered dearly for it.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:10%
He was ultimately protected
by the British Parliament that

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.552 align:middle line:10%
forestalled his extradition
to the United States,

00:14:06.552 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:10%
where the United States
government wanted

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:10%
to try him for hacking and
spying and revealing classified

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:10%
knowledge.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But the British people
and the British parliament

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.825 align:middle line:84%
protected Gary McKinnon,
and he is safe and sound

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and probably still recovering
from his ordeal in England.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.065 align:middle line:84%
The Secret Space
Program is real.

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:10%
It is siphoning off our national
resources, our national wealth,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:10%
and preparing the public
for what may turn out

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:10%
to be a fake alien invasion.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the danger, that
human beings may be wrought up

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
with panic and fear
through the use of MKUltra

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and mind control techniques
in the mass media

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to make us believe that we
are being invaded by people

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
from outer space and that
we must go to war with them

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and that we must use nuclear
weapons to fight them.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of that would
lead to self-immolation.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
That's going up in flames, for
those of you who don't know.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Self-immolation,
a very bad thing.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So it is my hope that
we will forestall this,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that we will not fall into
traps and ploys and false flag

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
attacks and panic at the
idea of being invaded

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:90%
by people from outer space.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people from outer
space are already amongst us.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They've been amongst
us for over 70 years.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They walk amongst us
unrecognized, some of them,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and others don't show
themselves in the daylight

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
because no one can really bear
their presence or their smell.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:90%
That's been my experience.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Certain extraterrestrials have
not only a horrible appearance,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
but have a foul smell that
will drive a person into panic.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a very strong
mind to hold itself together

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
when assaulted, assailed,
by horrible smells that

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes described as
sulfurous, sometimes described

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.937 align:middle line:84%
as, well, beyond description is
all I've got to say about that.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to go
into more details,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's something
that's very, very

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
damaging to the
human being to be

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of these beings.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And I do not recommend
anyone trying to make contact

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:90%
with space brothers.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:90%
I think we should be cautious.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We should not be afraid,
but we should be cautious.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
As President Reagan said,
"trust, but verify."

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I think verify, then trust.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.515 align:middle line:90%

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Telepathic communication
is mind to mind.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Humans are verbal.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:10%
We make a lot of noise.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:10%
But the non-humans appear
to have almost instantaneous

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:10%
thought, thought words.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They work in symbols.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:90%
They work in numbers.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is happening
in their minds,

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
it's huge downloads all at once.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early 1980s
was the first time

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that I was introduced by a
kind of whistleblower person

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in army military, active
at the time actually,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to the notion that
there is a secret war,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and that the secret war has
been ongoing around this planet,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
in this planet, underneath
the surface of this planet

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
for millennia, and
that the forces that

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
conflict with each
other is a mystery

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or was a mystery to this man
except that our government was

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
very concerned about who
are our allies really

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and who are our enemies.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it
was laid out to me.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of describing that,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
this man told me that he
was involved in a group,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
that they would get
some kind of a call,

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and they would go
to wherever there

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
was either a landing or a crash
or some sort of interaction

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
with something in the non-human
category on this Earth.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:10%
And we've heard about
Projects Pounce and Moon Dust

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:10%
and these various groups that
since the 1940s Truman had

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:10%
organized, MJ 12, Majestic 12,
and that part of their work

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:10%
was to have units
that were trained.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:90%
They were top secret.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't talk to anybody.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But their jobs were to go to
any location on the planet

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:84%
where there might be either
a crash or non-humans doing

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
something, and we wanted
to get there and monitor.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said we have been
able to send signals

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to the Ebens, another
type that are gray.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
They have heads that
are shaped like a pear.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They have eyes that
are not black lenses,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that they are large and usually
dark, but not the lens type.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And they sent out a
frequency asking for help,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and that one of the gray craft
went to this town in Arizona

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and met up with our
military people.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
This man telling me
this was firsthand.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:90%
This was his experience.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:10%
And he said his superior
officer came to him and said,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:10%
one of the Ebens has
agreed to let you--

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
the man who was telling
me his firsthand story--

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:10%
have the experience of
having a telepathic download

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:10%
so you'll know what it is like.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And his superior officer said
that they had an agreement.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The being knew that
humans are very

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
alarmed when these creatures
float above the ground.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
That is their preferred state
because they have technology

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:90%
that neutralizes gravity.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But they know that
humans get upset

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
by things that float in
the air, and so he said,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
he's agreed to
stay on the ground.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they walk
on the ground,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
they waddle, and
it will be funny.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It will look like Donald Duck.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared for it.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he will
get to a point where

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
he will start coming towards
you in a straight line.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
At about six to seven
feet away, he will stop.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
You will want to run.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You will feel like when
we do flamethrower drills.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Your entire body is
going to be feeling fear.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is in order.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I want you to stand your ground.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how
much you want to run.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:10%
I want you to experience
this telepathic download.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the guy telling me this
is 6' 3", 6' 4", a big guy.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I thought,
oh, give me a break.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a child.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for this.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Here comes the being.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:90%
It's waddling.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It looks like Donald
Duck in a cartoon.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
It makes him feel like
he wants to laugh.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
He's hearing his
boss telling him

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:90%
exactly what's going to happen.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
This thing is
waddling coming up.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said when it
got to about six feet,

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:90%
his entire legs began to shake.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to run.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
He felt like he
was going to faint.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
only thing that kept

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
me standing there is that I knew
that my superior officer was

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:90%
off to the left about 30 feet.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And by God, I was not going
to fall apart in front of him.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:90%
So I stood there.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:90%
But, Linda, it was terrifying.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, the
being's head tilted up.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when those eyes
met my eyes, I lost all control.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, the best
I can tell you,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
if you took seven
Hollywood movies

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and you started running them
through your mind all at once,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
sound, temperature,
touch, everything

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is going on in
seven story lines.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And on top of every
one of the films

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
are three-dimensional
gold hieroglyphs.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The symbols are running
on top of all of the film.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I realized my mind is
trying to ask questions.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And with every question
my mind is trying to ask,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.525 align:middle line:84%
it's making another one
of these branching movies.

00:23:04.525 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And his boss had told
him that when you faint,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:90%
we'll be there to catch you.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
that was such nonsense

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that until that moment, with
all of these films running

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
through his head, it had
never occurred to him that he

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
would ever faint in his life,
and he lost consciousness.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
It was three solid hours later.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:10%
When he opened his eyes, he
was lying in a cot in a room.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:90%
They had caught him.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They had put him in a bed.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Three hours to recover.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And when he opened
his eyes, he was still

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
not able to sit up and
get off of the bed.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Linda, that's
what my superior officer wanted

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:90%
me to understand.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
We all would like, just
like Spielberg's movie

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the little ET that got
drunk in the kitchen on beer,

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
we'd like to have
extraterrestrials take us

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to Starbucks and sit down
and have coffee and tell us

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:90%
about the universe.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
never going to happen

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
because the difference
between the way

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:32.325 align:middle line:84%
our mind works and their minds
work, they're overwhelming.

00:24:32.325 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is that I got a call

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that I might be able
to talk to the man who

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:84%
lived with one of
the Ebens retrieved

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
from the Roswell region and
had been taken to Los Alamos

00:24:52.250 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
National Lab between 1949 and
June 18, 1952, when this being

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
died of unknown causes is
the way the document read

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:90%
that I was shown.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:10%
And backtracking
from that death,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:10%
this was the story that I
was to hear from the man

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:10%
there at the site in Roswell.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:90%
He was with a group.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
They had gotten word that
there had been a UFO crash.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There is not a date on this
in terms of July 2 to 4, 1947,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
but we know that there
were three crashes.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
This might have happened
somewhere later in '48 or '49.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And by then, these groups
that were in Project Pounce

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:10%
and Moon Dust that were trained
to come to where there was

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:10%
any kind of an interaction
with what was being called

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:10%
by our government
"extraterrestrial biological

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:10%
entities," they were
trained to move in a group

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:10%
into a location.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
There would be some that would
pack up the-- let's call it

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:84%
the metal wreckage or
technology that they found,

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and there would be
others in the group that

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
would be focused on the
bodies, alive or dead,

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
biological entities.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And where this story starts is
that the group was moving in,

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and they could see bodies.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And the man who is talking
to me said all of a sudden

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:84%
in his mind, he felt pain,
heard a cry, high-pitched.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The other men are moving, and he
stops because he doesn't know.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
He can't see anything
in front of him.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:10%
But he's feeling this horror
inside of his own mind,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:10%
and he is absolutely paralyzed
with what is happening.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to me?

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Is this something here?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't see anything.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
He didn't at that point say
anything to the men around him.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:84%
He was completely disoriented by
what was happening in his head.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And not only was he
hearing this high pitch,

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:90%
he was seeing images.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, it was like
I was getting flashes,

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
like slides of something.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, and maybe it was like
I was looking through a window.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was dust.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this was the crash.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is what
was happening,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's being put into my mind.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
move, and I walked,

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and the other men were on.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
something is pulling me.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was being pulled
by jello to come and look right

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:90%
at a place.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he realizes
there's debris.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:90%
There is a dark shadow.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that he walked
over to the debris,

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and he picked up
something, and here

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:90%
is a live being, not human.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And when he picked
up the debris,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that what came into his
mind at that moment--

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
because now it was
eye to eye contact

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
with this being
lying in the debris--

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
was everything, what happened,
whatever the malfunction, what

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing as
the craft went down,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the crash, all of it, and
then the overriding pain

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that this being was feeling.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
told everybody there,

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:90%
come look at this.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
This is alive.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:90%
We need to help.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Because he was able to see
pictures, get sound, feel

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
emotion, it was decided that
his assignment from there

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
on out was he was going
to stay with this being.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
They transferred
both to Los Alamos.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And for that period of
time, as I understand,

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:20.592 align:middle line:84%
was in the year 1949, I believe,
from there to June 18, 1952,

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.425 align:middle line:90%
they lived together.

00:29:21.425 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
sentences that I

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
was told by this
man of the downloads

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that he got during
that period of time.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like
being with a child

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:90%
with the mind of a thousand men.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:84%
He would have these image
exchanges and thought exchanges

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that for some reason he
could get from this being

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:90%
and nobody else could.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Our government began
realizing that they

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:90%
needed to find translators.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
They needed to find
talented people who

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:84%
could get the images
and the numbers

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and the thought words
from these beings,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and they started
looking for translators.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the category
this man became.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But he said at one point in
all of their word exchanges

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
in their minds with seeing
pictures and symbols,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that this being was
explaining about where

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
they came from and the cosmos
and this sentence or sentences.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:90%
"We made you.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:90%
We put you here.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.055 align:middle line:90%
But you have to live it."

00:30:42.055 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And this man looked
at me, and he said,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Linda, what I've come to
understand from this being

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that I lived with and I loved,
the machinery of this universe

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
is reincarnation, the
recycling of souls.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
We treat the soul and
recycling like mythology.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
These beings seem
to be communicating

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:16.900 align:middle line:84%
that the most important part
of our life as human beings

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:84%
was the soul and what happened
at the moment of death.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.344 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.344 --> 00:31:25.839 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Individuals that claim
to be abducted by aliens,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:10%
all of the procedures done
of them seem to indicate that

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:10%
the aliens are
interested in their DNA.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:10%
And mothers or
mothers-to-be are exposed

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:10%
to certain babies
that are extracted

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:10%
from them during
their pregnancy,

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:10%
and later on are presented to
them so they could interact

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:10%
and eventually have aliens
study the interaction

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:10%
between the mother
and the fetus.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So apparently, long
story short, there

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a hybridization
program run by the aliens.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.193 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has been
going on for many years,

00:32:12.193 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and people are trying
to figure out what

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:90%
is the real purpose behind it.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most likely
hypothesis is

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that what the
aliens are doing is

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that they may be
using parts of our DNA

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that would allow them to be
able to live in this planet

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.960 align:middle line:90%
without having any problems.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.425 align:middle line:84%
In other words, oxygen is
very, very toxic, especially

00:32:37.425 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to the DNA.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But we have some special
techniques in order for us

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to counteract
that, to protect ourselves,

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to
work around it.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.358 align:middle line:90%
Aliens do not have this.

00:32:50.358 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if
they were to live

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:84%
in an oxygen-infested
atmosphere,

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
they would quickly
develop cancer.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:84%
In similar fashion, we are very
susceptible to radioactivity.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Aliens are not.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Because their crafts
are always leaving

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:90%
residuals of radioactive energy.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
say is that if we

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.580 align:middle line:84%
were to go out in another
planet and try to live there,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
we would have to be able to
incorporate that inhabitants'

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:84%
evolution into our DNA, which
will allow us to actually live

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
in this planet without
having any health hazards.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And that may be the
reason why they're

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
doing all this hybridization
experiments in order

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to create a species that
formerly belongs to them,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but will be able to
survive in this atmosphere,

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and will be able to eat what
is offered from this planet,

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to function,
to be able to see, to be

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:84%
able to hear, and to be able to
go about in an environment just

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:90%
like ours.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:10%
>> To any skeptic who says,
well, these are just stories,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.960 align:middle line:10%
these are just accounts.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:10%
Hell, life is just stories.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Life is just accounts.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:10%
The entire criminal justice
system, for example,

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:10%
is based on
eyewitness testimony.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
When did we stop thinking
eyewitness testimony was

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:90%
important?

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We put, and rightly so, a vast
amount of stock in testimony.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
Why shouldn't we do so when that
testimony comes from someone

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
who says they've seen a UFO or
they've had an alien abduction

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.209 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:34:35.209 --> 00:34:37.634 align:middle line:90%

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:10%
>> With most researchers
or whistleblowers,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:10%
they get approached by CIA,
and they are subject to immense

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:10%
pressure to continue their
research, receive funding,

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:10%
and at the very end, prove and
say to everyone that that was

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:10%
a hoax.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
An example of this case
is with Colin Andrews.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Colin Andrews was UK's foremost
expert on crop circles.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:10%
So what happened was
that Colin Andrews was

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:10%
a really strong figure
on that research field

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:10%
and apparently had
so many followers,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:10%
was approached by CIA.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And these are Colin Andrews
words in an interview.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:10%
He was approached,
and he was told

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:10%
that what CIA does with
most of researchers

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:10%
is that they fund them
and they keep them going

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:10%
and they keep them
moving on up to the point

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:10%
where they will say publicly
that this is a hoax.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
that's exactly what

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:90%
happened with Mr. Colin Andrews.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:90%
He went to the US.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
He received funding from
Rockefeller Institute,

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
up with a interview

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:58.435 align:middle line:84%
stating that at least 80% of
those crop circles are hoaxes.

00:35:58.435 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:84%
In the first movie
"ETs Among Us,"

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
within an analysis of the alien
autopsy presumably presented

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
by Ray Santilli back in
1995, we focused mainly

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:84%
on the medical aspects, on
certain interesting facts.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And we came up
with the conclusion

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that that may have
been an actual alien.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
What happens with
Santilli is something

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen with
other researchers

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:90%
or so-called whistleblowers.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
CIA approaches them
and invites them

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:90%
to basically debunk everything.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Later on, Santilli came
up with a confession

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that apparently this
was completely fake,

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that he manufactured this
doll with a friend of his,

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
that he was a specialist
on mannequin dolls,

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and another friend of his that
presumably was the surgeon that

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:84%
cut up the body,
and that it was just

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
a hoax or a
restoration of a film.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So he was giving us
a bit of a gray story

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
pretty much indicating
that that was a hoax.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
However, if we take a very
close look at this footage,

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.680 align:middle line:84%
again, we will see that
his story doesn't add up.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely no way
that his story explains

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:84%
what we've seen in this video,
and this is for many reasons.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
One being the fact that in
order to manufacture this alien

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that we see there, you
need skills that renders

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.920 align:middle line:90%
you a superb professional.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.840 align:middle line:90%
No amateur can do this.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
No somebody that
is in the field but

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is not doing an amazing job.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is not an amateur
who is having fun.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:84%
What makes Ray
Santilli completely

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.420 align:middle line:84%
fraudulent in his confession,
in him rescinding an explanation

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of the footage, is the fact
that in the second video

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
where he has the
debris and he's showing

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:84%
all the cockpits and
the panels and stuff,

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
apparently he says
that they came out

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:84%
with certain hieroglyphs
that they put in those beams.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But those hieroglyphs
are Greek, and they

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.915 align:middle line:84%
read "eleutheria," which means
freedom, which is something

00:38:01.915 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that Santilli never came
up with in his confession.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think Ray
Santilli must have

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:84%
been under a lot
of pressure, and he

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
decided to actually go about,
just like Colin Andrews,

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.760 align:middle line:84%
to play along and to
completely ridicule himself.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if he was really
looking out for a career,

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.900 align:middle line:84%
the last thing he
would ever do is

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:84%
to become a mockery for
everyone in the field

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and everyone around the world.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, we know that there's
another video out there

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that shows an alien.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's back from 1947
that shows an alien being

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:90%
brought into a base.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Santilli has nothing
to do with this.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:10%
If we study that
second video, we

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:10%
will see several
faces, apparently

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:10%
the people that used to
serve the Five or Ninth group

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.250 align:middle line:10%
at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we actually go back
to the Museum of Roswell

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and we look into the
archives of the people

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and the staff of
the base, we will

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:84%
be able to identify
the first medic that

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
reaches over and leans over
just to inspect that alien.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.850 align:middle line:84%
If you look closely,
that person has

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.840 align:middle line:84%
a deformity in his left ear,
which gives him an identity.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can look up this person
and we can find this person,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and that is going to be
a very strong indication

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:90%
that this video is authentic.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And if that video is authentic,
then Santilli's video

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.206 align:middle line:90%
is also authentic.

00:39:29.206 --> 00:39:31.636 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in the spring of 1990,
one of the subjects that was

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:84%
breaking out during that period
of time in 1990 were crop

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:90%
formations.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:90%
They were on "60 Minutes."

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They were on "2020."

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Walters was
talking about how

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:84%
are these incredibly
beautiful patterns being

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:84%
put down 800,000 feet long in
wheat fields or barley fields

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
or rape fields,
especially in England.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:10%
But that year-- a lot of
people don't realize--

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:10%
I counted the
number of countries,

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:10%
and we had crop formations
being photographed

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:10%
in 23 countries, 1990.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So by 1991, I wanted
to get to England.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to spend
time in the formations.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see
what it felt like.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And by the summer of 1992, I
finally was landing in London

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.180 align:middle line:10%
and was taken to
Marlborough to get

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:10%
to where I was going to be
staying in the Vale of Pewsey.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:84%
For 2,000 years,
the cereal crops

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Vale of Pewsey in England
have been associated always

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
with the cycles of
planting and harvesting.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
For 2,000 years, the
same land has been a home

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:90%
to all kinds of crops.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So this has been the heart of
where crop formations first

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.030 align:middle line:90%
emerged in the 1970s.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:90%
A few people knew about them.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And then by '88 and
1989 were the first

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
what they called pictograms.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were 750
feet long, 800 feet long.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They were largely circles
with lines and odd symbols

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:90%
coming off of the lines.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:84%
By 1992, when I landed and
got to the Vale of Pewsey,

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:84%
everything was evolving into
very sophisticated patterns.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
There were beginning
to be people

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.290 align:middle line:84%
who were recognizing that
there was mathematical language

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:90%
in these crop formations.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had not been
in a formation.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I had studied hundreds
from the United States.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the first thing
that I wanted to do,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I joined up with
friends, is to organize

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.560 align:middle line:90%
getting into a crop formation.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had arrived at night,
and it was the next morning.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Seven of us went to
one at Milk Hill,

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:84%
a place that's had a
spectacular formation

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:90%
every year since around 1989.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there,
we parked in an area

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
where we could park
cars on a hill.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we had to go as a
group along the top of Milk Hill

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to get up above a
430-foot, I believe it was,

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:90%
huge--

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it was spirals,
paths, big circles.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It was not a pictogram.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:90%
It was like a geometry.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And I remember getting up, and
we got to a point right above.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people who were
more experienced, they said,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
we've got to come down where we
can go down a tram line so we

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:90%
don't trample any of the wheat.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And we all, like children,
for reasons unknown,

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:84%
we're on a hill, but we all
started sort of running,

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and we ran all the way down
into the Milk Hill tram

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
line going right along
the Milk Hill formation.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were
about seven of us.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I just happened,
for some reason,

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to be the person who
was at the furthest.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So I am going down the tram
line the furthest this way,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
was kind of spread

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.550 align:middle line:84%
along here, 400 feet bigger
than a football field.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I had my 35 millimeter camera
hanging around my neck,

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and I had the curiosity to
go right into this formation.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see, what does
it feel like to be in it?

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm walking with
tremendous innocence,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:90%
my first pattern ever on Earth.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I get to an opening, and it
was like I hit a wall of jello.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It actually was firm
and made me kind of

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:90%
like I bumped into a wall.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not seeing a wall.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing
anything but air, but I

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:84%
could feel there
was this solidness,

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped, puzzled.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I looked down.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:90%
The others had stopped.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was going
into this pattern.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So I brought my
35 millimeter up.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I put it so I could change
and go down real close

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and come back and wide, and
I started taking photographs.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when I went into
a zoom in a particular place

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.200 align:middle line:84%
only about 5 feet from
where I was blocked

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
by this whatever, jello, I
could see wheat this direction,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.070 align:middle line:90%
wheat this direction.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I could see another layer.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my Lord,
I want to get in there.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:90%
This thing is layered.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And after about
another minute or two,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:84%
whatever this strange jello
that had blocked apparently

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:57.710 align:middle line:84%
all of us, it just
kind of evaporated.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt almost like I
was being invited into the crop

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:84%
formation at that
point, and I didn't

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:90%
want to step on anything.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So I went on tippy-toe for a
while like in a circle trying

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to see, how can I get close?

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:84%
How can I get photographs
of the layers?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And finally, my curiosity
overwhelmed my desire

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:22.670 align:middle line:84%
not to step on any of this crop,
and I sort of on my tiptoes,

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I went to what I had been
trying to photograph.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I got down on my hands
and knees, and I put my hand--

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.200 align:middle line:84%
here was the top layer, here was
the layer going this direction.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
There was another layer, and
it went down seven layers,

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.150 align:middle line:90%
all opposite directions.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And then my fingers,
I could feel the soil.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the soil
coming under my fingernails

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:53.240 align:middle line:84%
as I did this and realized that
the top of the formation that

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.850 align:middle line:84%
was going like this
all the way down

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:90%
was about up to maybe 12 inches.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.960 align:middle line:84%
That from the soil
up, this pattern

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:84%
was spread for 430-some feet
with all of these layers.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And there were not
even layers, there

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.630 align:middle line:84%
were areas where it swirled
like water in circles.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There were all
kinds of exquisite--

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:90%
nothing was out of place.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It was breathtaking.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt this
pull to go to the right.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else had
gone to the far end.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And at 430 feet, I'm that far
away, they're that far away,

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:90%
but I'm pulled to the right.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm walking, I'm trying
to walk on the edge on my toes.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm walking to
go to this far end that

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:84%
seems to be pulling
me, I'm realizing

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that the complexity
of those seven

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.410 align:middle line:84%
layers and these
beautiful swirls,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.770 align:middle line:90%
it's continuing all of the way.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And I get to the end.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's wheat that was
about waist high.

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm now at the edge.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.730 align:middle line:90%
You can't go any further.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And here is solid, solid
wheat, like you were inside

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:11.930 align:middle line:84%
of a velvet carpet
but it's wheat.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm standing there
looking out on the solid wheat

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and then looking in at
the complexity of all

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of these layers and then
back out onto this wheat,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.520 align:middle line:90%
it was like a thought voice.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It said, "Life on Earth
is not guaranteed."

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And I turned again.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I turned to look out on
the wheat with "Life on Earth

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
is not guaranteed,"
suddenly it was

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.230 align:middle line:84%
like when you're in the presence
of something like a Bengal

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.210 align:middle line:90%
tiger.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Bengal tiger can
be 20 feet away from you

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.790 align:middle line:84%
in a zoo or a safari park,
and you're protected,

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
but when you look into the
eyes of a Bengal tiger,

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:02.330 align:middle line:84%
there is not only
profound intelligence,

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:84%
but a sense of danger
because the intelligence is

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing anything.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment
looking out on that wheat,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:18.810 align:middle line:10%
it was as if a Bengal tiger
was staring back at me.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:10%
And I remember that moment,
this is what made this pattern.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:31.970 align:middle line:10%
This is an intelligence that
is capable of destroying

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:10%
us or letting us live.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Life on Earth is not guaranteed.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that moment
that every crop formation

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that I was ever in by the
hundreds for the next decade,

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that voice was always
there, that sense

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:90%
this is really important.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:59.030 align:middle line:84%
These crop formations have
mathematical language.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.100 align:middle line:10%
If we were smart
enough, we would all

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.880 align:middle line:10%
be sharing what is the language
in these crop formations

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:10.820 align:middle line:10%
and praying that that Bengal
tiger intelligence knew

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of us actually
cared about whether we

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.240 align:middle line:10%
survive on Earth or not.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1992 during my
first trip to England,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.260 align:middle line:84%
as I began moving
into crop formations

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and feeling them out, a
lot of us started saying,

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:33.530 align:middle line:84%
this formation, it feels really
positive, and I feel good.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was in that one
over on the barn road,

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and it felt terrible.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that made me start
thinking, what if there

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.840 align:middle line:84%
are two types of energy, two
types of intelligences that

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are even competing
with each other

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:54.420 align:middle line:84%
in the crops of the world,
like the skin of the world?

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And that where we feel
really good in some,

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:84%
it may be something that
is trying to inspire us,

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to give us joy, to give
us exaltation, which I

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:90%
felt in those crop formations.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And those that made
me feel sick or that

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:16.520 align:middle line:84%
made me stop, that was the
beginning of these crop

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.920 align:middle line:90%
formations are not equal.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Not all are positive,
and not all are negative.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But when they are negative,
it had a physical impact

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.190 align:middle line:84%
on the body, and I think
the mind and the soul,

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that many of us who came
to go to crop formations

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:84%
together would have this moment
where, this I have to leave.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Now what else was
interesting about this,

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize that
over the 10 or 12 years

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that I kept going to England,
that the crop formations,

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.830 align:middle line:84%
if this was going to happen
where you felt like you were

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:58.040 align:middle line:84%
sucked of air, it
was going to be

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in something like an
eightfold geometry

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:05.810 align:middle line:84%
or a five-fold geometry
or maybe an 11-fold.

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It was never a three,
it was never a six,

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.360 align:middle line:84%
it was never a seven,
and it was never a nine.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the whole issue of
sigils and ancient geometries

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical laws being
underneath the sacred geometry,

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.620 align:middle line:84%
it was one of those
evolutions that people

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.610 align:middle line:84%
who were mathematicians
began to study in detail

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and put on websites
what they were

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.790 align:middle line:84%
finding in terms of mathematical
ratios in crop formations.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I remember
one of the first dialogues

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I had with people.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever feel that when you
were in an eightfold geometry

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that it was different
than the sixfold geometry

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:54.650 align:middle line:90%
across the field?

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And there had been one
specific example where

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.750 align:middle line:84%
there were six or
seven of us, and there

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:84%
had been Windmill
Hill, and there

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:90%
had been an eightfold geometry.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And then in the field right
opposite, it was a sixfold.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of us who had gone
into eightfold geometry, when

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:84%
we got into the sixfold,
everybody was saying,

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.750 align:middle line:90%
there is a difference.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that those
behind certain geometries,

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:25.370 align:middle line:84%
whatever the intelligence, are
in conflict with everything

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that is behind the three,
the six, the nine, the seven

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:90%
geometry?

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:10%
You will see that the Flower
of Life, which should be

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:10%
ends with threes,
that go to sixes, that

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:43.340 align:middle line:10%
go to nines, that that is
associated with what is called

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:10%
the Light or the Christ Light.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.290 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the eight, that
eight geometry is associated

00:52:51.290 --> 00:53:00.800 align:middle line:84%
with Mesopotamia and ancient
sigils, as if math, numbers,

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.060 align:middle line:84%
associations with
things in the unseen

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.770 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
fabric of what is

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:11.760 align:middle line:84%
behind the crop formations that
have occurred on this planet.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:17.690 align:middle line:10%
It may be subtle to many
people, but the challenges

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:24.560 align:middle line:10%
we need to understand why it is
that a place like Glastonbury,

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.880 align:middle line:10%
with the red and white springs
that have been going since they

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:10%
say for 2,000 years, and that
Arimathea brought Christ there

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.580 align:middle line:10%
and that there is a relationship
between this land where

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:10%
crop formations seem
to have focused.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that it isn't
just math, that it isn't just

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:49.190 align:middle line:84%
something from
another intelligence,

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that the crop
formations themselves

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.780 align:middle line:84%
go to the heart
of something that

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get
human attention,

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that the soul of humanity is
at stake, that life is not

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:06.890 align:middle line:84%
guaranteed, and that
the crop formations seem

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to be spelling out
that there is conflict

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:84%
between light and dark, numbers
and mathematical language?

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And that has always been with me
ever since I spent so much time

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:28.520 align:middle line:84%
in them that it goes beyond
beauty, it goes beyond poetry,

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.420 align:middle line:84%
it goes beyond
mathematical language.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.560 align:middle line:84%
That the crop
formations that began

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:84%
coming to this
planet in the 1970s

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:84%
have something to do with
a philosophical argument

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:45.560 align:middle line:84%
about what is allowable
to do with life.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And that the crop formations
to me today in 2017,

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:84%
the crop formations have
always been like a signal.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt
they were a signal.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:84%
We have a path that
we can go to life,

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and we have a path
we can go to death.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:10%
And something like that
Bengal tiger intelligence

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:07.250 align:middle line:10%
is watching, provoking,
waiting, and I hope

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:10%
inspiring the move to life.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.790 align:middle line:90%
