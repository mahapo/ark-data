00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The most documented UFO
sighting of all time occurred

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
in December 1980 in Rendlesham
Forest next to Bentwaters Air

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Force base in Suffolk, England.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:10%
The witnesses included base
commander Lieutenant Colonel

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:10%
Charles Holt, US
servicemen John Burroughs,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:10%
and Sergeant Jim Penniston,
who took copious notes

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:10%
and recently completed a
700-page book, "The Rendlesham

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
Enigma."

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Since 1984, I have been
trying to understand what

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:10%
happened at RAF Bentwaters
Woodbridge in England when

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:10%
a group of various men
encountered various kinds

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:10%
of lights in Rendlesham Forest.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, a man
named Jim Penniston,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
who was a staff sergeant
back on the night of December

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
26th with John Burroughs,
they encountered a huge blast

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
of white light in the forest as
they were chasing lights that

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
were moving through the trees.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then Jim said that,
out of that light,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:84%
there just seemed to pop in
a black, glassy triangle that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:90%
had symbols on it.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And when he touched the
symbols with his fingers,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:84%
he saw zeros and ones start
pouring into his mind.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Over the 30 some
years after that,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
he had never told anyone about
zeros and ones and binary code.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:10%
But when he finally did start
talking about the binary code

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:10%
and we started translating
it somewhere around 2010

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:10%
for the first time in the
"Ancient Aliens" production

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:10%
we were doing, it was a series
of words about, essentially,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:10%
humanity must
advance for survival.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what it seemed
to boil down to.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The period of the event
was in December of 1980.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
We didn't learn about the
binary code until late 2010.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 2015,
then five years later,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I get a notice that an
extraordinary case has emerged

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
out of the state of Georgia.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I got the
email saying that--

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
see if you can get in
touch with this Army guy.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It had a drawing, a
sketch of a huge sort

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
of oval, football-shaped
craft, and it

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
was identified as having
been drawn by a military guy.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And finally, when I did get
to talk with him, he said,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I can't let you
use my real name.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:90%
My family could be in jeopardy.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm still active Army.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
I can talk to you

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%
is if you can alter my voice.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
have to show me.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we have
to do a trial audio,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and then you alter
it, and then I'll

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
tell you if I think it works
because I'll lose my job.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, we did.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:90%
I got it altered.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Then we did a long
interview that started

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:90%
in Savannah, Georgia area.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
He was with his wife, two
kids, a dog, and a cat,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
and they were packing to leave
and move from Hunter Airfield

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
to go to a new assignment
in Fort Carson in Colorado.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And his wife and he had decided
they would travel at night when

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
it was cool and then they
would sleep in the day

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and that that would be easier
on the children and the pets.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So it is now in the late
afternoon of June 28th, 2015.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And they get in the car.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And in his work, he
has been in the Army

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:90%
for more than a decade.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And his job is one
where they count on him

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at anything
that is in the sky

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and tell them how big it is,
how high it is, whose it is.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what he does for a
living for the United States

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Army.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And he uses global positioning
satellite information

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:10%
GPS, to him, is as common
as somebody else picking up

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:10%
a pen and paper.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
He programmed his GPS in their
truck to go up through Atlanta

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and on up to Colorado, and
everything was in order,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and they get in, and he
and his wife had said,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we should be in Atlanta,
and they had an hour.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
That would be in
the early morning.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.405 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing that
they both remember vividly--

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:90%
they see a light up in the sky.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:90%
He's still driving.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:90%
The truck is moving.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.482 align:middle line:84%
And they both comment,
wow, that's a bright star.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATES WHOOSHING] Whatever
that bright star was,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to just literally pop
right in front of this truck,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
causing him to move over to the
shoulder and stop the truck,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
because what he and his wife,
who are not talking with each

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%
other--

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
they are both staring at
what has now come down

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:90%
on the road in front of them.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And in his Army
mind that is so used

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to calculating
distances and sizes,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
he says, this is at least
820 feet in diameter.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It was covering the entire
road and off to the sides.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And he and his wife later
would draw sketches.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And they both saw symbols
that were right along

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
under the center of an area
that the wife said she saw what

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:90%
she thought were round lights.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
fully understand

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
what happened because it reaches
a point where the whole thing--

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
820 feet-- just pops out
just like it popped in.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
He comes to like he is numb,
fuzzy headed, starts the truck.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%
They start driving.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
He's going straight on
the road that they're

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
on because he's just trying
to move on the street.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And in about five minutes,
they come to a little store.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And he pulls in.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It has gas pumps.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
He had looked at his watch,
and he knew, as a military guy,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that this thing had
popped in at 1:24 AM.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared to have
popped out at 1:29 AM.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
He knew that it's now
at least 1:35-1:45.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to
open up the truck.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Linda, I
had to lean on the door

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because I started to
try to move my legs.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move my legs.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
My entire body felt like I had
turned in to wet spaghetti.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, I literally
fell out of the truck,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
hanging on to the door, trying
to make my legs move, thinking,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:90%
what has happened?

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to us?

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, my wife was sitting
in a kind of numb situation.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
We weren't talking
to each other.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I felt like I
was sort of drunk and numb.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We hadn't had anything to drink.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
something had happened

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.070 align:middle line:84%
with that big thing on the
road, but I didn't know what.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said I, finally could
start to feel in my legs.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And I start to walk.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And Linda, I couldn't even--

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I was stumbling.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Somebody watching me would
have thought I was drunk.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I get to the glass door in
this gas station little store,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and I get in there,
and I got some water,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and I got some
stuff for the kids

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and for my wife and me
and the cat and the dog.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at the receipt.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And the receipt said,
Wadley, Georgia.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Wadley, Georgia?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:10%
That's 90 degrees
off of the route

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:10%
from where we were in
Savannah going up to Atlanta.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
How could we be in
Wadley, Georgia?

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And he gets back to the truck,
and he explains to his wife,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what is happening.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And they go down the
road a little bit more,

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to see if there
is an interstate.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And he realizes, we're
in rural Georgia.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to do
with any freeway, highway--

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:90%
how did we get off?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:90%
He does a U-turn.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
He finally gets back
on the interstate.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And by sunup, they
get to a motel

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
that is outside of
Atlanta, Georgia, which

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:90%
is where they wanted to go.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:90%
He said, they're exhausted.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
The kids immediately
go to sleep.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:90%
The cat and dog goes to sleep.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
His wife goes to sleep.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that when he
got into bed that there was

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
something-- he was troubled.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:90%
He thinks fitful dreams.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.080 align:middle line:90%
The very next conscious moment--

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
he said, imagine
you've gone to bed

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you
have been on a pillow.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you open
up your eyelids--

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I had my right arm
against the door jamb

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:90%
of the bathroom in the motel.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
My left arm is holding
the receipt, an 8 and 1/2

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:90%
by 11 receipt that we got.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
In this hand, I have
a ballpoint pen.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
In this hand, the receipt
has, completely covering

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:90%
most of it, zeros and ones.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at
my own handwriting,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:10%
and the zeros and ones trail
off to a WTF, what the--

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:10%
and he said, I can't move.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I do not know what is happening.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time that
he and I got to talk,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
he was willing to send me
not only those zeros and ones

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
but other zeros and ones that he
had gotten for a period of time

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:90%
after this strange event.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see
that what we had here

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:84%
might be like Jim
Penniston at RA Bentwaters

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
when he was in
Rendlesham Forest.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
If this is now another military
person getting a binary code

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
download, then I've got
to try to translate it.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And when I went to a
retired Navy captain

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:10%
and to a geneticist
scientist in Australia who

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:10%
is really good with
binary code, they

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:10%
both did binary
code translations.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:10%
And here is what came into
this Army sergeant's mind

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:10%
from whatever occurred between
the 820 foot diameter disk

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:10%
that stopped them in
that road and they find

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.795 align:middle line:10%
they're in Wadley, Georgia.

00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said that
Jim Penniston had

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
a theme that humanity
had to advance

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and that there was some
kind of need to have

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
people have a
broader consciousness

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:90%
in order to survive.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Here is what I call Sergeant CJ.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:10%
Here is the translation
from his experiences

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:10%
getting binary code in
his mind from June 30th

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:10%
until January of 2016.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:10%
For a period of time, he was
waking up many different nights

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:10%
writing down zeros
and ones in a notebook

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:10%
that he kept by his bed, and
this is how they translated--

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:10%
"continuous protection
of humanity,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:10%
49.27 north, 11.5 east.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Expose hidden knowledge
to all citizens.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Advancement imperative
for planetary survival.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Beware of Orion 1350.3
and Zeta Reticuli 39.170.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:10%
Avoid signal messages sent."

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
What we found is that a void
signal messages appeared

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to be you're sending
out radio signals

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to possibly
put you in danger.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You should not be sending
out messages into the cosmos

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
from Earth.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Beware of Orion 1350--

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:10%
turns out that that is exactly
the number of light years

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.590 align:middle line:10%
that would be equivalent from
here to Orion and Zeta Reticuli

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:10%
one and two is 39.7 light years.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a message in binary
that actually has the lightyear

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
distances of Orion and
Zeta Reticuli embedded

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in the binary.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And then, when you
get to that first line

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:10%
about continuous protection of
humanity, 49.27 north and 11.5

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:10%
east, when you look up
that latitude/longitude,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:10%
it is Nuremberg, Germany.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:10%
And I remember seeing that
for the very first time--

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:10%
Nuremberg, Germany, continuous
protection of humanity?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I think World War II and
the horror of World War II

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and how the International
Court was held in Nuremberg.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back
to the 1500s, it

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
is also Nuremberg that is
famous for a woodcut that

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
was done of a variety of
UFOs in various shapes

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
fighting each other,
where it shows

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
that some UFOs are crashing,
and it's a famous woodcut.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84%
What is the link between
timelines on Earth, timelines

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
of something that may be
coming from other dimensions

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and possibly from inside this
universe that could communicate

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to us latitudes, longitudes, and
information that seems to tie

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
together, like a weaving, past
history events, present events,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and implying that there
is danger in a future

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
if humans do not
advance more quickly?

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
When we go to the rest of the
binary translation for Sergeant

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
CJ, "imminent threat
soon upon Earth's

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:90%
leaders and civilizations.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Expose and disband hidden
knowledge to all citizens.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Employ safe and controlled
joint study to all minds.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Progression imperative
for combined survival.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
The idea here is that if
we don't get the truth out

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and share it to the
whole human family,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
we end up being threatened
by something because we

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:90%
will be left in ignorance.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially
what Jim Penniston

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:90%
received in Rendlesham in 1980.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on into a
very interesting paragraph

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that says, "Royal
Emerther--" Emerther

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
has been a name
assigned to a very

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
specific type of tall gray
humanoid over the decades--

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:90%
very mysterious.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:84%
"Royal Emerther warning-- expose
foreign technology to all.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionary advancement
needed to prevent takeover."

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Takeover by what?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:10%
This leads to a very interesting
issue that comes up now

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:10%
with all of the military
people who have been exposed

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:10%
to UFOs and ETs in their work
or to people like Sergeant CJ

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:10%
and Jim Penniston, a
staff sergeant in 1980

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:10%
in RAF Bentwaters
Rendlesham Forest.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And that appears to be a
theme that also has come up

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewers who have
worked for the Defense

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency in the
Central Intelligence Agency,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
teeming with life,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
it is way past time for
humanity on this planet

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to be told the truth, and that,
in all of this life that fills

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
this universe, there are
allies and there are enemies

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and that we humans
on this planet

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
would not have survived if we
did not have allies who wanted

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
us to survive, have protected
us from those who might

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:90%
want to see us gone from Earth.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And that is a theme that
I have encountered now

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:10%
in my professional career
over and over since 1979--

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:10%
trying to get to the bottom
of the truth about animal

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:10%
mutilations, human abductions,
government cover-up,

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:10%
policies of denial, and why
we, as a 7.2 billion population

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:10%
on Earth of Homo
sapien sapiens--

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:10%
right now, we've got
all kinds of programs

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:10%
that are going to be
taking people to the moon

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:10%
and to Mars and beyond while
we humans are being kept

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:10%
dumb and blind by
our political leaders

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and a 1% dominance
on this planet that

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:10%
might be related to a secret war
that is going on between allies

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:10%
trying to help us and enemies
that want to destroy us.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
