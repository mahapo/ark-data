00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>: If you look at our past,
we were hunter gatherers

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:84%
or gatherer hunters, depending
on the ecosystem that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors lived in.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And we ate what the
environment provided.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near a
lake, we ate fish.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near the ocean,
we were probably fishermen.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the tropics,
we ate what was growing there.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the
far north, we hunted.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But we ate seeds, we ate
insects, we ate nuts,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%
we ate plants mostly.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
We had a very high fibrous diet
because the original plants

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
were much more high in
fiber than plants are today.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And the animal products
we ate were mostly

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
insects and grubs
and things like that.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we were able to catch
or kill a larger animal,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
those were wild animals, and
they were very low in fat

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and they were particularly
low in the storage

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
fats, the saturated fats that
we know are dangerous to us.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And their muscle
tissue was real.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.218 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they moved.

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:90%
That's how they survived.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
That's how they lived.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.287 align:middle line:84%
Today, though, modern meat,
animals are living in feedlots.

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%
They're living in factory farms.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:90%
They are not allowed to move.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't develop
muscle tissue.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:90%
They're very high in fat.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's mostly storage
fats, highly saturated fats.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're also--
in order to keep

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
these animals alive
under these conditions,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
these conditions
are so unnatural.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
The animals are so
miserable that they

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
have to inject them
with antibiotics

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
or feed them antibiotics and
oftentimes use hormones as well.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And other chemicals, pesticides
to kill the flies that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
are around and insecticides.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the meat
absorbs these poisons.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
And then when modern meat
it's full of these things

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that our historical meat
didn't have, including misery.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
how you quantify misery.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But anyone who sees how these
animals live in industrial meat

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
production and dairy production
knows that they're miserable.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
misery on my menu.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is something
about that misery that

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:90%
gets passed on.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And also they're
fed obesogenic diets

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
because the industry
wants them to gain weight

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:84%
as rapidly as possible with
the least amount of food input.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So they want the weight
gain to food input ratio

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
to be as high as possible.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:90%
The diet is designed for that.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And the animals have
been bred for that.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we eat animals
that have been bred for that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and that have been fed a
diet designed for that,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is it any wonder
then that obesity

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
is rampant in our culture?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I think this contributes to it.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, oh,
but our ancestors ate meat,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
down to the butcher,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
or to McDonald's and buy
that, they don't realize

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
how different metabolically,
nutritionally, energetically

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.558 align:middle line:84%
that meat that they're
buying is from the meat

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about our
ancestors having eaten.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because what our ancestors
ate were wild animals.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:90%
The closest thing would be game.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And when people hunt deer,
I'm not a hunter myself.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't want-- I
don't believe in it.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you this, I will
respect someone who is a hunter

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and kills a deer, particularly
if they do it cleanly and he

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
eats everything from that
animal because we're going

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to McDonald's and we don't--
we've normalized that.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't think about it.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
animal behind that.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And that animal lived
a life of torture,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
not the free life of the deer.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the hunter
is actually more

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
ethical than the average
everyday consumer who's

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
unconscious of the fact
that the meat they're eating

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
came from an animal
whose life was

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
a disgrace to the
human-animal bond.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And it contains
substances like hormones,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
like antibiotic residues, and
sometimes antibiotic resistant

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
bacteria that then
undermine our health.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in the
health implications and health

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
consequences of modern meat and
dairy products compared to what

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors ate is enormous.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful to see.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I respect those
who want to eat meat

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and are doing their best
to get grass-fed and truly

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:90%
pasture-raised animals.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Although even then
they're breeds

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that have been bred for
maximum weight gain.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't eat modern
meat at all, ever.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't in over 50 years.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
If someone wants to eat animal
products as part of their diet,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the most ethical
and the healthiest

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
is wild fish, particularly
fish that is low mercury,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that is high in
omega-3 fatty acids.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Salmon, wild salmon, I'm
talking about sardines, herring,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:90%
mackerel.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
These are fish that are
low in heavy metals,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
low in contaminants, low
in pesticide residues,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and are high in
the types of fats

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies need to thrive
and our brains need to thrive.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's the best.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
eating a wild fish,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:90%
you're eating a wild animal.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:90%
You're eating an animal.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It may be living
in polluted waters.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we have treated
the oceans and rivers and lakes

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
like garbage dumps.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the waters of the world
are contaminated to an extent.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.023 align:middle line:84%
But there are fish that pick
up more of that and a fish

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:90%
that pick up less than that.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.732 align:middle line:84%
And the fish I
mentioned are the ones

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:90%
that pick up the least of it.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, a
wild Alaskan salmon

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is one of the lowest fish in
mercury that you could find.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Most forms of tuna, on the other
hand, are very high in mercury.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.257 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big issue.

00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
eat fish, you don't

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.065 align:middle line:84%
want to take mercury
into your system.

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
What you want to eat,
though, is as many plants

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
as possible, as many fruits and
vegetables and seeds and nuts

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Some people do well with
whole grains, others don't.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a person-- you have
to listen to your own body

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
on all of these things.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to be vegans
and eat no animal products.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to eat
some animal products.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of variation
here on what's a healthy diet.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But a healthy diet does not
include the processed junk foods

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:90%
that people eat today.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%
We've normalized that.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.788 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere, but that
doesn't make it healthy

00:07:17.788 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't
make it good for us.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I grew up eating Sugar
Frosted Flakes for breakfast.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I know what that does.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
feed that to my kids

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
or want to see it fed to
kids or adults either.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat any factory
farm products ever.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't for over
50 years because I'm

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
a conscientious
objector to that,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:90%
that way of treating animals.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It's so cruel.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And it produces
products that are

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
harmful to us, that are so
different from the meats

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
grew up eating.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There's paleo diets
where people want

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to eat as our ancestors in
pre-agricultural times did.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't domesticate animals.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't drink
the milk of an animal

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't control
the lives of animals.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
When we eat modern meats
and dairy products and eggs,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, we're consuming
and we're contributing our money

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to a system that has enormous
environmental implications.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Greenhouse gas emissions, water
pollution, soil degradation,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
so many, many serious
consequences to the ecosystems.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're eating products that
are damaging to our bodies,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to our metabolism, to
our glucose regulation,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:84%
to our hormone balance, to
our cardiovascular health,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to our respiratory health,
to our mental health.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're also eating
products that are really

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
cruel to the animals involved.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to
be healthy, I think

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a marvelous thing
that the food choices that

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:84%
are healthiest
for us personally,

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
they give us the most strength,
the most vitality, the strongest

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:90%
immune systems.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.965 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
least susceptibility

00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to pathogens and infectious
diseases, the strongest

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:90%
respiratory system.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we can breathe
deeply with life

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the beauty of
simply breathing clean air.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully we have clean air.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And maybe then we're more
protective of our air

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and more aware of it.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Less likely to
smoke, less likely

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to allow polluters to prevail.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the same food choices that
are so much healthier for us

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
are also kinder to the animals.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't involve treating animals
with egregious cruelty,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and don't cause the
environmental distress

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and damage that modern
meat production is

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
so good at producing.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that is a
win-win-win across the board.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sign--

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I take it as a sign that this
is what we're meant to eat.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're meant to
live so that we can thrive

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and others can thrive.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So that we can thrive
and we don't destroy

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
the world in the process.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
conquer the world

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and turn resources into
revenue and exploit and damage

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
everything in order
to prevail over life.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We can just be with life
and be with ourselves

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in a way where we
respect life and we

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
live with reverence for the
life force in us and in others.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And we then protect the forests
instead of just see them

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:90%
as board feet to be sold.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And we protect the
life forms that

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
biodiversity of the planet

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and part of the inextricably
interwovenness of our world.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:90%
We protect it.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And we protect it
because we love it.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And because it loves us back.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It feeds us.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.117 align:middle line:90%
It's our source.

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we don't want
to pollute the oceans

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and fill them with plastic.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Then we don't want to fill
our skies with toxic gases.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Then we don't want to fill
the atmosphere with gases that

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
are destabilizing our planet.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we want to live with
respect for ourselves and others

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:90%
because it feels so good.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%
