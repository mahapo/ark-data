00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In those days, I used to
work in these ice cream stores

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:84%
and make milkshakes for
people, and scoop ice cream,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and put it into quarts
and half gallons,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and give them ice cream
cones, and so forth.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know who I was.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was fine.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I just was a kid working
at the ice cream store,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
as a lot of kids did.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Barack Obama's first job

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
was as a clerk behind the
counter of a Baskin-Robbins

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have those memories.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Mine was a little different,
but I did the same thing.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
In those days, in the
back wall, on the wall

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
were these huge photographs,
murals of sepia-toned pictures

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
of Guernsey dairy cows
grazing in beautiful Wisconsin

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:90%
pastureland.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And I used to look at
those pictures a lot.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they
were beautiful.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And it made me feel good
about the dairy product

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that we were using, along
with the sugar and flavors

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:90%
to make the ice cream.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed that that's
how the cows lived, who

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:90%
gave the milk we were using.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And that felt good to me.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved animals.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, I
went with my dad.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall exactly
why we were there.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But we went to a dairy from
which Baskin-Robbins sourced

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:90%
a lot of its cream and milk.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge dairy in the
Central Valley of California.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.996 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't anything
like those photographs.

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a feedlot.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And the cows were enclosed.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:90%
They're milked by machine.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a conveyor belt. There's
a ton of them in a small space.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're fenced in.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make contact
with one of these cows.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of shocked
by what I'm seeing.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:90%
But I want to make contact.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So I approach the fence.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a cow, I make
eye contact with it,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:90%
and I moved towards it.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm probably 14, 13 or 14.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm a boy.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And I mean well.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:90%
I want to say hello to the cow.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe stroke it, pet it, maybe
make contact, I don't know.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I approach it,
it gets frightened.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And it jumps away.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I approach
a different cow.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
These cows are afraid
of human contact.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
human presence.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Even a small boy
who's got nothing

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
but love in his heart
for them, doesn't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
mean them ill in any
way, they're terrified.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think what has
happened in their lives?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.065 align:middle line:84%
These placid animals,
these sweet animals,

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
what has happened
in their lives?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.065 align:middle line:84%
What kind of human
experience have they

00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:84%
had that they're afraid
of a little boy coming

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
to say hello to them?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
pretty darn bad.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them standing in
their own manure, some of them

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.705 align:middle line:90%
almost up to their knees in it.

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
There were flies
all over the place.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.667 align:middle line:84%
And these fly strips
that were full of poisons

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to try and deal with them,
which weren't very effective,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:90%
but they were there.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I heard about the use
of hormones and drugs

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to deal with some of
these problems, which arise

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
from the confinement of cows.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:84%
If they're on a pasture,
like the photographs showed,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
you don't have those problems.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But they had them in a
feedlot, and I was shocked.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, those
photos aren't real.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And on the drive back,
I said to my dad,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
this isn't anything
like the photographs

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that are on the back
wall of all the stores.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
no, no, it isn't.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, does
that bother you at all?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:90%
No, why should it?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
talk about it with him.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.315 align:middle line:84%
And later in my life, fast
forward a number of years,

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and I've now written
the books I have--

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and I've become a spokesperson
for the humane treatment

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of animals in meat
and dairy production.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And the California Milk
Producers Association

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
creates an advertising campaign
nationwide, maybe worldwide.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know that.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Great cheese comes
from happy cows.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Happy cows come from California.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And they had
pictures in their ads

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of cows grazing in
beautiful pastures,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to sell California
cheese to other states

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and other countries.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
successful ad campaign,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.028 align:middle line:90%
successful in their terms.

00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:90%
They made a lot of money.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It increased the sale
of California cheese.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Except there was no truth in it.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I even found that
the photographs they used

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
of cows grazing were taken
in Auckland, New Zealand.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they couldn't
find an example

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
in California of what
they were trying to say

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is the state of
cows in California.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
There were no happy cows in
California in those days,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and there aren't now.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
There may be a few
individual cows,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
someone's got a cow or two on
their back acres or whatever.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
industrial production,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
commercial production,
no, it's all

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
gone in the direction of
factory farming and feedlots.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And the industry
continues to lie about it.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Happy cows come from
California, they said.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And they show these
pictures of beautiful cows

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful pastures.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, the cows in
California are in dry lots.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not in pasture.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Many of them never see a blade
of grass in their entire lives.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I, along with
several animal rights

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
organizations, sued the
California Milk Producers

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Association for false
advertising about this.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's still working
its way in the courts.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
say it's free speech,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was protected
by the Constitution.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And our attorneys said
it's commercial speech.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They were able to obfuscate
that distinction in court.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a difficult thing to win.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, though, that
it's just outright lying.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It may be that great cheese
comes from happy cows.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you that.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But the tagline happy cows come
from California isn't true.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And people have a right to know
how their food is produced.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
People have a right
to know if they're

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.662 align:middle line:84%
going to drink milk, if
they're going to eat ice cream,

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to eat meat,
if they're going to eat eggs,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:84%
how those products, how
the animals involved lived.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And if drugs were used,
if antibiotics were used,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
if hormones were used, if
other chemicals were used,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:90%
they have a right to know that.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And if those animals
lived miserable lives

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and were confined
so cruelly, people

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%
have a right to know that too.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
The industry does not
want people to know.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I think my early
experiences with Licorice

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
gave me an undying awareness
that our relationship

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:90%
to other animals matters.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:90%
They're not just things.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They can care about us.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
We can care about them.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
And we should.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not arguing that nobody
should ever eat meat,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:90%
everybody should be a vegan.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I am arguing that
people have a right

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to know how their
food is produced.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that
the more people

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
see the cruelty, the abominable
cruelty that is involved

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in industrial meat, dairy,
and egg production today,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:90%
the more they'll rebel.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be a vegetarian.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If you see it-- you don't have
to be an animal rights activist.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.583 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be a
particularly empathic

00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
human being, if you see
how cruel it's become,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to want to say no to it, to
not want misery on your menu,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
to not want to participate,
and take into your body,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and fuel your body with the
products of a system that

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
treats animals with
that degree of contempt.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who has any love for
animals, any feeling for animals

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
at all, it's shocking
and appalling to see

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
the degree of cruelty
that's become normalized

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:90%
in industrial meat production.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
If you actually confront what
is happening to these animals

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
by the millions
every day, how severe

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
it is, how deeply they're
tortured by the conditions

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:90%
in which they're kept.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.007 align:middle line:90%
And I want people to know.

00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I want them to have the
opportunity to know.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I knew some people
would turn away.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I knew some people couldn't
handle the pain of it.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew some people
wouldn't want to know.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But I thought if I
presented this in a way

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
with as much
compassion as possible,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
there was a chance that people
might open their eyes to it.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if people do see
it, they'll turn away from it.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean turn away
not wanting to see it.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll turn away
from eating it,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
from using their money
to buy these products.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore-- every time
you buy a product like this,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the producer sees your purchase
as a signal, do it again.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Make more of this.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Do the same thing more.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
profiting from it.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we withdraw our support
economically from this system,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
the system will atrophy.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
As the demand goes,
the supply will drop.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
hoping to see happen.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I often thought if you're
going to smoke tobacco,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
if you're addicted,
how can you do

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that in a way that doesn't
give your money to the tobacco

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:90%
companies?

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Is there a way to do that?

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody knows that
smoking is bad for your health.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody is addicted,
is there a way to do it?

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm always thinking, if
someone needs to eat meat,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
if they're addicted or
they feel they need some,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is there a way to do
it that isn't feeding,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:84%
isn't giving your money to
these industrial factory farm

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
systems that treat animals
with absolute disdain

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
for their basic
needs, coop them up

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in conditions that are obscene?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants
misery on their menu.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to eat that stuff,
if they know how it's produced.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:90%
