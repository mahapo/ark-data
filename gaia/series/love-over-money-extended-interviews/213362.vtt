00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I got to know those
celebrities who had a social

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.460 align:middle line:84%
conscience, who had an
environmental conscience,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.265 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to see their
influence used to help make

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:84%
the world a more
beautiful place.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Not all celebrities
are like that.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them aren't.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But I got to know
the ones who were.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I got to know Sidney Poitier.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
He came to an event
that I was doing.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Susan Sarandon.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
There were many
people in Hollywood

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that I got the
pleasure of meeting

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and got to interact with.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the persons that--
another person that meant

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:90%
a lot to me was Paul McCartney.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, Paul is still with us.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:90%
And I love Paul.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I got to spend time with
him and his then wife, Linda.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were very, very
good to me and to our causes.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's a beautiful
man, and he really cares.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Linda turned him
into a vegetarian

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and virtually a vegan.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And at first, he was
a little resistant.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
But then he thrived with it.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
He got to be 64, and has he had
written about, and much older.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Still doing concerts
all over the world.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Still four-hour concerts in city
after city after city in his

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
late 70s.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And he has that energy to do it.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And partly, it's because
of the way he eats.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's a very beautiful guy.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I got the pleasure of
meeting these people,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of people.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I also got the
pleasure of meeting

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ordinary
people, normal people.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
not household names,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
but they're just as beautiful
souls, just as meaningful lives.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a tendency
in our culture

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to think of celebrities
as more important.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:90%
They have influence.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And if they choose to use that
influence for the greater good,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
then that can make a
greater difference.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But really, most
of the folks I met

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.690 align:middle line:84%
were just everyday people who
were changing their lives,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
wanting to live lives
that were healthier,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that were more loving, more
compassionate, more caring,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
wanting their influence on the
world to be a positive one,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
wanting to align their food
choices with their heart,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
wanting to address
some of the ills, some

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of the suffering in the
world that is needless and is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
preventable and in their lives,
and were joining together

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
in local EarthSave groups and
joining together in other ways

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this awakening
that was taking place.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
My mother had a--

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.193 align:middle line:90%
a painting teacher.

00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
She and a couple of her friends,
her very wealthy friends,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
would bring this
gentleman from France

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to teach them
painting for a week.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And they'd pay him
a lot of money.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember his name.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But he was a very
prestigious painter.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And he brought his
wife with him one time.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she's going to
make the meals for the week

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:84%
because we've changed
the way we eat.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
share it with you.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And they had become plant based
because they had read "Diet

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%
for a New America."

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had brought copies for
everyone, including my mother,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:84%
not knowing, again, that she
was the mother of the author

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%
of this book that they loved.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So they pass out
copies of my book

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to all of my mother
and her friends.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of her
friends know as soon

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
as they see the book that that's
my mother's son and he's persona

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
non grata in her life.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet these people with
just love in their hearts

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
wanted to share what
they've learned.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.742 align:middle line:90%
They're not pushing it on them.

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:14.367 align:middle line:84%
They're just, in case
you're interested

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and why we eat this
way, you'll love it.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be healthy.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mother had to
just deal with that.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
My mom was pretty resistant.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
She and I had had a
conversation once earlier,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
where I said some
things that I believe

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
about health and food
and the impact of what

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
we eat on our well-being.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
She said there wasn't
any connection.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And you could eat whatever
you wanted and those things.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just all your
genes, she said,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
how your health would develop.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.433 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
she said something.

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, but
we'll see, won't we,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.683 align:middle line:84%
because you're eating
the way you are.

00:04:57.683 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see if you have any
different life as a result.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, my mom, in her early
80s, developed-- late 70s,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%
developed Alzheimer's disease.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And she also had
macular degeneration.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
So she went blind.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:90%
She lost her memory.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:90%
She eventually went deaf.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
She became incontinent
and immobile

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.093 align:middle line:84%
and continued to live on in this
state for a number of years.

00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Her dementia was severe.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:90%
It eventually killed her.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
She was not capable of
recognizing what was happening.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know who I was
anymore when I was there.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:90%
It was very sad.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would sometimes
think, well,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
you said once, we'll
see as we get older.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:90%
She's blind.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't remember anything.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Her cognitive capacities
are destroyed.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:90%
So she isn't seeing.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:90%
But I am.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And it does matter.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I took no pleasure in,
look, I'm right; you're wrong.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.435 align:middle line:90%
It was just a tragedy.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And it also was
fuel for me to do

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
the work I do because
I don't want anybody

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to have to have their
later years be like that.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that my
mother ate the way

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
she did because she was
obstinate and wouldn't change

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and also because
that's all she knew.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what she had
learned at some point.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And she hung on to that.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And she lived by it.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And she died by it.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:90%
And it was sad for me.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It was sad for
anybody that knew her

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.095 align:middle line:84%
to see her in that state
for quite a few years.

00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was also a story that,
though full of grief and loss,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
had a moral to it
for me, about what

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
we eat, how we live does matter,
does have an impact on how we

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
will age and our mental
faculties as we age

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and our physical
well-being as we age.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And young people
often don't know that.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:90%
They think they'll live forever.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.793 align:middle line:90%
They think they're invulnerable.

00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
They think they can eat
anything and they'll be fine.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's
true for a while.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:90%
But the consequences develop.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And over time, they
develop even more.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And right now, young
people are making choices

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and building the habits that
will carry through their lives.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And if those habits
are healthy ones,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:84%
if those habits are
compassionate ones,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
if those habits are
life-affirming ones,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have one
type of outcome in their life.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking that young
people, if they're wise,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
choose their habits wisely,
choose the habits that

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
will be fulfilling to them, that
they'll be glad they chose when

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:90%
they get a bit older.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anyone to have to
go through what my mother did.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will say to me
that somebody in their family

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
isn't listening and
is eating poorly,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.453 align:middle line:84%
and their health
is deteriorating.

00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
reach that person

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
because they love that person.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:90%
They want to help that person.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But the person
won't listen, just

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
wants to make the choices
they want to make.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And their health is
degrading as a consequence,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:90%
sometimes quite seriously.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people will just eat
their way into their graves,

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
make choices that provide
maybe short-term pleasure

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
or gratification or just
some kind of solace to them

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
but lead to destruction, lead
to death, lead to disease.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to
die at some point.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I want us to have a
high quality of life

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%
for as many years as possible.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a vision of
aging that isn't

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
the same as the normal
thing in our culture,

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:90%
where people degenerate.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:90%
They have Alzheimer's.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
They're on so many meds.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And they lose the joy
and the vitality of life.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
lose their memories.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They lose their capacity to
even do simple, basic things--

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
parts of living.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
always necessary.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we can, if we
take care of ourselves

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and we take care of our bodies,
our bodies will take care of us.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we choose wisely,
how we eat, and what we do,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we think, and
how we relate to life,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
life will respond
differently to us.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
