00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My uncle Burt
Baskin, my dad's partner

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and brother-in-law,
was a really big man.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:90%
He was 6' 5".

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he weighed.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:90%
But he was a very big guy.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And he ate a lot of ice cream.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody
in our family did.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that he ate more
than anybody else than my dad.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Probably he did because
my dad wasn't that big.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And Bert was really big.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And Bert suffered a series of
heart attacks in his early 50s.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And he died from one of
them at the age of 54.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty young.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
This was a man who had
it all financially.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Very, very successful
businessman.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.473 align:middle line:84%
He had a beautiful
family, talented kids.

00:01:05.473 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And then he's dead.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
He's 54.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he died,
I asked my dad,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
do you think there could be any
connection between the amount

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
of ice cream that
Uncle Bert would eat

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and his fatal heart attack?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And my father looked at me and
said, no, his ticker just got

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
tired and stopped working.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
message besides the words

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%
that he was conveying to me.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was, don't ever
bring that up again.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:90%
It was a taboo topic.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
My dad did not want to
consider that possibility.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to think that
the family product might

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
have contributed to the death of
his partner and brother-in-law.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to think
that ice cream had anything

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:90%
to do with heart disease.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was, again, part
of the tension for me.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%
I know that it contributed.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how much.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:90%
But I know it played a role.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I know ice cream is not healthy.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at my family.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's heavy.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to sell
a product that is going

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%
to undermine anybody's health.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to compromise
anybody's health.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I would rather contribute
somehow to people

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
feeling more alive and
better than to provide

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
momentary pleasure that actually
depresses their life force.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
We invented a lot of flavors,
obviously, over the years.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
There eventually were 800
or 900 different flavors

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that would rotate so that
there were 31 different ones

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:90%
in the stores each month.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And the invention of new
flavors was something I always

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:90%
found interesting and creative.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But there was one flavor
that I had a lot to do with,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
Jamoca Almond Fudge.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a coffee ice cream with
some chocolate ribbon in it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and bits of almond, and
it became a big seller.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It became one of Baskin-Robbins'
most successful flavors.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And it had been my
idea originally.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
For a while, I thought, is this
going to be on my tombstone

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:90%
when I die?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:90%
He invented Jamoca Almond Fudge.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a flavor that a
lot of people like.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It brought pleasure to a lot of
people, and I'm glad for that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's ice cream.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And the more you eat of
it, the more your health

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:90%
is going to suffer.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I have pretty
darn mixed feelings

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
about having
invented that flavor.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
When I tell people or
people learn that I did--

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
memories of the flavor.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Many of them do.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go,
oh, that's great.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And I smile, and I appreciate
the positive energy

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
that they're sending my way.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And another part of me
is going, thank God,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do that for my life.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to see
people live healthy lives.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to see people radiant,
vital, powerful, clear minded,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
clear hearted, able to live
clear lives, brilliant lives,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:90%
heartful lives.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, the
more ice cream you eat--

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and if you really love
a flavor like that

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and you eat a lot of it, it's
going to squelch your energy.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It's going to clog
up your arteries.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to increase
your risk for dementia.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It's going to increase your
risk for heart disease.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going to increase
your risk for cancer.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's going to increase
your risk for osteoporosis.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's going to subdue
your life force.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It could well
become an addiction

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
or be part of an
addiction, addictive cycle.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it's
so tasty in the moment,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:90%
it's so spectacularly tasty--

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.793 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
when you're inventing
flavors, that's what you want.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But I started to think, I don't
know if that's a good thing.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
If it gets people hooked,
if it makes them eat more,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:90%
then it's good for them.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
If they lose touch
with the joys of life

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're all
about the flavor

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and their mouth
becomes everything

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even notice
how they feel while they're

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
eating it in the
rest of their body,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's not a
path I want to take.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
I value health.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's the hungry person
that knows what food is worth.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The sated person
takes it for granted.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.295 align:middle line:84%
And with health, I think it's
somewhat sometimes similar.

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
The person who's always been
healthy takes it for granted

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and does whatever.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But I have been very health
conscious my whole life

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and made a lot of choices to
be as helpful as I can be.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the reasons
that the ice cream business was

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of dubious from
a health point of view

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
impacted me so much was that
I didn't have my health.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
what it was worth.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.463 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to be selling
a product that might undermine

00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
anybody's health, that might
contribute to anybody's heart

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't want to do that.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
regained my health,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do something,
if I could, to help people

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
be healthy, to help people live
healthier lives, happier lives,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
more creative,
joyful, vital lives.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that the food we
eat has an enormous impact

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
on how much vitality we
have, how much clarity we

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
have in our thinking, how much
resilience we have emotionally,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
how much vitality and
vigor and responsiveness

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:90%
we have physically.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And it became
really obvious to me

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to help
people eat healthfully

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
so that their lives would be
more beautiful and loving.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And the cattlemen's association
and the milk board and the dairy

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
council and the egg producers'
association, the pork board,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
were just after me and
trying to discredit me

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and trying to break
me if they could

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of different ways.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But what kept me going
really was the suffering

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:90%
that could be alleviated.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I went, I was hearing
stories of people telling me

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
that they had read my book.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And they had made these
changes in their diet

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and had experienced
these health benefits.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
stories were amazing.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I actually received--
this is before the internet.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:90%
This is before email.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I received 80,000 letters
over the course of these years,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
80,000 letters from people.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And the vast
majority, 99% of them

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:90%
said things like I'm describing.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for what

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
you've done for me, my
family, for our world.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:90%
And so I was so happy.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
It was such a privilege
to be able to play

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:90%
