00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't have a very
developed ideology or vision

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of what life would be
like on the island.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We just were taking
it one step at a time,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
figuring it out
as we went along,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
figuring that we could figure
it out as we went along.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember, when we planted the
garden, there were deer around.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that they would
eat the vegetables if we didn't

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:90%
create some kind of fence.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have any
materials to build a fence with.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:90%
So I improvised.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
And we got cardboard boxes.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we found some
branches and cut

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
them, that were reasonably
straight and reasonably

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
thick to be the right height.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And I got some cement
and put the branch

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
into the box of rocks, and
the rocks would hold it,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and then poured cement into
the box, and it hardened.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And now we have a fence post.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And we got some chicken wire,
and we strung it around.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
This is how we built
our garden fence.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And it did keep the deer out.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It fell down a lot.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And we had to keep
always patching it.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But one day, there was a
ranch several miles away,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and their cows just
grazed on the island.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.993 align:middle line:84%
And they had found
their way to us.

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the only time it ever
happened that these cows showed

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:90%
up at our property.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But there they were,
a bunch of cows.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was amazed.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.842 align:middle line:84%
And then they start, and they
just go right through the fence.

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:90%
They just push it right over.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And they gobble up the kale.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's our vegetables,
we depend on this.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're eating so fast,
all of our vegetables.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm angry about it.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, get away from
our vegetables, you know.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:90%
And so I start yelling at them.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't do any good.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:90%
They just ignore me.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So I get the only weapon
I have, which is a broom.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And I start waving it around
in the air and yelling,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and they just totally ignore me.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
They look up,
[MAKES MUNCHING SOUNDS],

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
moo, you know.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I think,
OK, I've had enough.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do
something about this.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got to protect
our food here.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I take the broom, and
I throw it at one of the cows.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I miss him.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It lands right at
his or her feet.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And the cow looks at me and
starts eating the broom.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a straw broom.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, so much for
my protecting the homestead.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm just giving them more food.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:90%
And it devoured the broom.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was this feeling
of, my goodness,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
we lost a lot of vegetables
in a few minutes.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
It happened so fast.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, they moved on.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But there we were,
left with bare stalks.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was a real imprint on us.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was a loss.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we would have liked
to have eaten those vegetables

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:90%
ourselves very much.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We got to work right away to
grow the things and all that

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and restore the fence.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But we knew it couldn't--
defense that we could make

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't keep out cows
if they wanted back in.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, they
never did come back.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
It was one of my
first tastes of how

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.795 align:middle line:84%
rapacious cattle can be on the
land, how much they can eat,

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:54.595 align:middle line:90%
how quickly.

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I think of them as peaceful
animals, for the most part.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:90%
But they do eat a lot.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:90%
They're big creatures.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that
when we feed cattle,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
it takes many, many pounds of
grain to make a pound of beef.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
inefficient way

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to go about feeding ourselves
and feeding the world.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We were committed
to eating plants.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't have guns.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have
killed a deer to eat it.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I suppose if the alternative
was starving, literally,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I might have.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But the commitment was to do it
in a different way, and we did.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
There was only one
exception to that.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
One day, we were hitchhiking.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And this guy picked us up
and asked where we live

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and what we do.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, you talk with people.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, it came up that
we were vegetarians.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
way the conversation got

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:90%
to that, somehow it did.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And he could tell we were poor,
by the way we were dressed,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and where we lived,
and so forth.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.645 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to
be a chicken farmer.

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:90%
He had a bunch of chickens.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to give us
a ride to a certain spot.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And it so happens he was just
going to drive by his place.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.263 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you
know what, I want

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:31.555 align:middle line:90%
to give you guys some chickens.

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:34.032 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I think his
assumption, we couldn't

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.573 align:middle line:84%
afford-- we only ate it
because we couldn't afford

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
it was why we didn't eat it.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And so he stops, and he goes
out, and he grabs a chicken

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and breaks its neck, and
another one and breaks its neck,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.585 align:middle line:84%
and brings it and
gives it to us.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And I felt his generosity.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to honor that.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to do
with a dead chicken, how you

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:90%
convert that into what you eat.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.012 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with the
feathers, what do you do?

00:06:12.012 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
But he told us what to do.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You hang it up for
a while, and then

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
how you pull the
feathers out and stuff.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And we thought about it,
and we decided, well,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
this has come into our
life in a good way.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
This guy's coming
from a good place.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:90%
These birds are already dead.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:90%
We didn't ask him to do that.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what would happen
if we go ahead and eat them.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.203 align:middle line:90%
We ate those two chickens.

00:06:42.203 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
only animal food

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that we ate during those
years on the island.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We just believed
in trying to live

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:90%
with plants as our nutrients.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.388 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have enough
land to have animals.

00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:90%
We didn't want to have animals.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We grew our garden and bought
our rice, and wheat, and beans,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes potatoes.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, Thoreau, you
know, I had read Walden Pond,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
but I missed the part
about he only did it

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
for three or four months.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I missed the part about
that he would go into town

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and get some of his food.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And I just missed that.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.273 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we were going
to do what Thoreau did.

00:07:39.273 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, that's
not what Thoreau did.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
it's a lot harder

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:90%
than we thought it would be.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about it, and you think,

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
what did you think
it was going to be?

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know enough to
realize how difficult it

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:90%
was going to be.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So we waltzed right into it, la
dee da, thinking, well, we'll

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:90%
figure it out.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be a
lot harder than we expected,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and a lot more work, and a lot
more difficult and challenging.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And we did mostly figure it out.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we survived.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And we grew inwardly
through the process.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, given
the way I'd grown up,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
with maids, and room service,
and first class everything,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:90%
country clubs, it was healing.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It was healing for me.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't say for Deo if it
was that healing for her.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I wasn't any
longer the spoiled rich kid.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And that mattered to me.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I needed to prove to
myself that I wasn't just

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
who my parents wanted me to be
and who I was in their world.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out
who else I could be

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and what else there was.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult. And
I don't recommend it.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And if people hear my story and
think, oh, that sounds great.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do that.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell them,
take a deep breath,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
take a series of
really deep breaths.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Quiet your mind.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you really?

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Because it is hard.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying don't.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But I am saying don't think
it's going to be a piece of cake

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:90%
because it isn't.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Growing food is hard work.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And I learned that.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have great respect for
the people that grow our food.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I saw how hard it is,
how difficult it is.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And even though I'm
all about organics,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw what happens
when pests come.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And I see the temptation to
spray, and get rid of the pests,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:90%
and kill them.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
And the crop grows and--

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:90%
so it seems like magic.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the easiest way sometimes.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
We always were organic.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:90%
We lost some crops to pests.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
We found workarounds.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We learned about companion
planting, and crop rotation,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and ways to lessen the loss.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's hard work to grow food.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And I will never forget that.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always grateful.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
There's not a meal that
I eat that I don't think

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
with gratitude for the
people that grew this food,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and the people that drove the
trucks that transported it,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and the people that
worked in the fields,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and everybody
involved, that we can

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:90%
have the blessing of being fed.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't take any
of that for granted.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot of us do.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We think food comes
from the store.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And we think meat
comes from the store.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It comes through the
store, but it comes

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:90%
from an animal who had a life.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
There was a farmer.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
There was a rancher.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
There were workers.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's working their
butt off so we can eat.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
The least I think we
can do is be grateful

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and try to live a life fueled
by the energy of that food.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
That's respectful to the
people who make it possible

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
for us to eat and to live.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
