00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I wasn't healthy as a child.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Neither really were
anybody in my family,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.503 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
weight problems.

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't overweight ever,
but I had polio as a child,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:90%
was in a wheelchair for a time.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The doctors told me,
this is permanent.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:90%
I honestly hated it.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:90%
I felt really restricted.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, however, the feeling
and movement returned to my legs

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.795 align:middle line:84%
slowly, over time, more the
right leg than the left.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But I was pretty
frail, and I limped.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was 21, my left leg
was three inches shorter

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
than the right one,
not very strong.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't put a
lot of weight on it.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I definitely favored, I still
favor my right leg a lot.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:90%
At that time, I was gimpy.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember meeting with
a doctor when I was 21.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, your bones
are-- your growing years

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
are over.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So your left leg is just going
to always be that much shorter.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going to have
to learn to live with this.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, and back when
I was much younger,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
another doctor had said,
this is polio's permanent.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%
You'll never walk.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:90%
He was wrong.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought this guy
could be wrong too.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Doctors don't always
know everything.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.542 align:middle line:84%
And when I changed my
life, when I walked away

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
from Baskin-Robbins,
when I stopped

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to be the person
my dad wanted me to be

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and started to try to be the
person my soul wanted me to be.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I started, instead of trying
to please him always, started

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to try to be in alignment
with my own higher power

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and what it needed
and wanted of me,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
started to be true to myself.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I changed how I ate
completely, shifted totally

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
from the standard American
diet to a very, very

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
healthy whole foods,
plant-based diet,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and began to exercise,
and do therapy, and do

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
yoga, and meditate, do things
that seemed to matter to me.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:90%
My left leg grew.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It didn't grow right away.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It took some years.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But it is now, eventually it
became as long as the other one.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:90%
I eventually became a runner.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I eventually became
a marathon runner.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I eventually became
a triathlete.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had to work really hard
at those things, harder than

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:90%
if I hadn't had the polio.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:90%
But I did it.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And I did it because
I loved being vital.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I loved being alive.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what I learned
from being in a wheelchair,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
only for a short time,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
compared to what was expected.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:90%
I want to move.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I see people
who have legs that work,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
living sedentary lives, sitting
and then sitting and then

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
sitting and then sitting, and
then when they could move,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
sitting some more, I think,
oh, my God, you can move.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Your legs work, and
you don't use them.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
You might as well have polio.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a self-imposed
sedentariness.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I love to move, and
for me, movement is life.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose I value it
more than I would have if I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
hadn't had that restriction.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly
also feel that when

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
people are ill and have
limitations, they need help,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:90%
they need care.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to be shunned.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
to be stigmatized.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
to be objectified.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:90%
They're people.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
They're people.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
When I see somebody
in a wheelchair,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.552 align:middle line:84%
if I want to talk
to them, I sit down.

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to be on
the same level as them.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
If I see someone who is ill,
my heart goes out to them.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why all of
us don't have compassion

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
for the people who are afflicted
or people who are disadvantaged

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
in whatever way.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that the
measure of a society, it's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
how it cares for those who don't
have all their powers, who need

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
help.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And by that measure, our
society is failing in many ways.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see us succeed more.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, would be success.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing what I can
toward that direction.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
What was developing
when we were living

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in a log cabin in the woods
was a tremendous awareness

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of the healing power of
the way we were living

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:90%
and the way we were eating.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I experienced that in myself,
primarily, to begin with.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:90%
My leg grew.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I started to run.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:90%
I started to enjoy my body.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
We started to dance.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of yoga, and
I got very good at it.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I started out very stiff.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I began to enjoy my body in a
way I never, never had before.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And I attributed some of
that to the change in diet.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
We had been eating,
before then, pretty much

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the standard American diet,
with a lot of ice cream.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we moved to the
island and to the cabin,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%
we just changed completely.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And we ate only plant-based
foods, and only whole foods,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and mostly what we could grow.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, we both
noticed, really dramatic,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
unexpected to us,
changes in our health.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I began to wonder
if changing our diet

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
has made so much
difference to us,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
might it be that if
large numbers of people

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
changed their diets in ways
that made sense to them,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
from the standard
American highly processed,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
high in sugar, high in saturated
fat, based on animal products

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
from factory farms
diet, to the kind of way

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
we were eating, in
some sense, would they

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
also experience dramatic
health changes, benefits?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And I began to study.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I began to read the
medical literature,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
peer-reviewed studies in
all kinds of journals.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And to my amazement, I found
out that, yeah, you know,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot that
has been learned.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:90%
The public doesn't know it.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you know
where to look for it,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
you can discover that there have
been very reputable studies,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
very convincing studies,
showing that this kind of change

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
will produce this kind of a
result in almost every case,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:90%
predictably, reliably.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
That we weren't
just an anomaly, we

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
were actually an
example of something

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted other
people to know about.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I had not been healthy
in my childhood.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I had had the polio.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And there were other problems
that I'd had as well.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had been a
pretty frail kid,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
with pictures on my childhood
bedroom wall of sports stars who

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
were fit, and vital,
and powerful, which

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't, but wanted to be.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And now I was becoming
that way, and loving it,

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and wanted the world to know
if, in fact, this wasn't

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:90%
just idiosyncratic to us.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was beginning
to learn it was not.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It was in fact something
that a lot of people

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:90%
could benefit from.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a voice for something
that's happening here.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I get to be that voice.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we get to be,
we, we, we get to be

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
part of this wave of
awakening that's taking place.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's changing lives.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And those lives that are changed
become healthier as a result.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
They become more
environmentally integrated.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So people are living more
eco responsible lives,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
