00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.160 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we really
need to define--

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
redefine success in a way
that includes our hearts

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and includes our love and
includes our compassion

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and includes our
caring for one another.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just about
a dog-eat-dog kind of thing.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Dogs don't even
eat dogs, in truth.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:90%
But when we know--

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I think we know when
we're a success when

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:90%
our hearts are strong.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And we live with them in a way.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And so our life
reflects our hearts.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We make choices that express
our love, our caring, and that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the defining
aspect of who we are.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I worked-- I went to
Alabama and Mississippi

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to participate in the
Civil Rights movement.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I was a kid from the North.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I was a white kid.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that was
history happening.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.239 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was an opportunity
to be part of something,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to witness something that
was of immense significance.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, the racism in our
society was abhorrent.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
My dad thought, you're
trying to rock the boat.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
culture in the South.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.837 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't go down there.

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
You should leave them alone.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't want you.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see eye to
eye on that either.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the war in Vietnam.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was a
ridiculously stupid idea,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the war, and cruel and a waste
of resources and terribly,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
terribly damaging
to our soldiers

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
but to the people of
Vietnam, most significantly.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Everybody involved got hurt.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And I opposed the war.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I protested it.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:90%
My dad was in favor of it.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So we had our
differences in values.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I began to understand
that for me to--

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
even though I loved my dad
and respected his achievements

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
tremendously, for me to
follow in his footsteps, which

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is what he wanted, I would
have lost my integrity.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I would have lost
my soul in some way.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I'm here
on this Earth to do,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
invent a 32nd flavor.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.835 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, well,
you could take stores

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And you could build a
company even bigger.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
yeah, so what?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Why would I-- yes, I could.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You've built something
powerful, big, strong.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I could continue that.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But there was something in
my heart that just said,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:90%
that would be lucrative.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
That path is paved with
gold and ice cream.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The other path is really
confusing, awkward, strange.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it will lead.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll just have to put one
foot in front of the other

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and take it a day
at a time and see

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
what unfolds and try to get
into alignment with my spirit,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
with my wholeness, with the
greater good of our world,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that
we are inextricably

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
interwoven with the
whole Earth community.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
called, honestly,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to live a very different
life than the one he

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
had planned for me.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:10%
And it was so painful because
how do you say no to something

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:10%
like that?

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:10%
My dad thought I was
crazy to walk away

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:10%
from that kind of money,
into a life of insecurity.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
for me, when I walked

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
away from the
financial security,

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I became more emotionally
secure, ironically,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because I now was
listening to and trying

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to abide by and express
the gifts within me

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and the understandings and
love in my heart for life,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to just
seeking the dollar.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Our society teaches us that
that's what success is.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
When we say somebody
is a success,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
usually, what we
mean by that term

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is that they've
made a lot of money

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:90%
or they have a lot of money.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a success.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
impoverished view of success.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I think a successful
human being-- well,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
we probably all have to
define that for ourselves.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But for me, anyway, I
define success for myself

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
as living in harmony with my
spirit and the spirit of others,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
living with respect for myself
and others, living with respect

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
for creation, for this
beautiful, endangered,

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
fragile, crazy world and messy
world but loving it anyway.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
where I find my heart.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The world's longest lived
cultures, the healthiest

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and longest lived, where there
are the most centenarians,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
people that live to 100,
and supercentenarians,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
people who live to 110, are--

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
have been studied.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And we know who they are.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We know what they do.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:90%
And they vary a little bit.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
They're all veganish.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:90%
None of them are purely vegan.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But they all eat
a lot of plants.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And none of them eat very
many animal products.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And none of them
eat any modern meat.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And none of them eat any
processed foods or the packaged

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:84%
foods that we see in
our supermarkets that

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
are full of sugar and
chemicals and processing.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And they also care
for each other.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They live in a way where their
relationships with one another

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:90%
are their wealth.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We think of wealth as what we
acquire, the things we own.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They think of wealth as who
they love and who loves them.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
They think of wealth as their
character, their reputation

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:90%
in their communities.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And they care for what they
experience as their wealth.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:90%
They care for each other.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They care for themselves
and their characters

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
people they become.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And they help others to
become the kind of people

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that they want in
their society--

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
honest people, hard-working
people, reliable people,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
people of integrity
and thoughtfulness

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and depth and creativity.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And they value the
person who can sing.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They value the person who
can make beautiful things.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They value the person
who nurtures others.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They value the people who
contribute to the well-being

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:90%
of their communities.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody amasses
personal stuff, what

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
we would call wealth, at
the expense of others,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:90%
they don't value that.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
They see that that
ruptures the connectivity,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the connective tissue
of the culture.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they look
askance on that.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And they may even find
that to be shameful.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We, on the other hand,
will celebrate lifestyles

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:90%
of the rich and famous.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I find that a little crazy
because we have decided

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that what makes a
person rich is something

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that I view as something
that harms, in many cases.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person who
is rich in money

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and uses that money
to help others be well

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and to help others live
happy and joyful lives

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and safe lives and secure
lives, that I honor immensely.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
We need more of that.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But all too often, our
rich people don't do that.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And the cost to
their souls is great.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And the cost to our society
is possibly even greater.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We all know the world is in
tremendous crisis in peril

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
way we've defined

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
success is part of that problem
because we are, as individuals,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking about what
gifts do we have to develop,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate, to grow inside
ourselves, and then to give,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking about what we
can acquire, what we can take,

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and rather than thinking
about what we have to give.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And to be in reciprocity with
life, we give and receive.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
give and receive,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
you need to live with respect
for yourself and for the world

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:90%
and for everyone else in it.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
billionaires and lead

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the world in homelessness as
well, that to me is a shame.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:90%
That to me is an embarrassment.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
That to me is a
tremendous mistake

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that we've made in how
we define ourselves.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we can learn again
where our hearts are,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
find them, and let them teach
us and show us and guide

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
us and live according to what
is in our hearts and souls

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have come to this Earth,
to share, to give, to be known

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
for, instead of just the
fame for its own sake,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
then we are playing the
part we are here to play,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
in the healing.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And each of us
has a part to play

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in the healing that's needed.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.515 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you and I are each one
seven billionth of humanity.

00:09:27.515 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
of it that way.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
That's just a tiny,
tiny drop in the bucket.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But if there's enough drops,
it ceases to be a bucket.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the tide
of history turning.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It becomes something
that is unstoppable.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It becomes something that is
good and wholesome and beautiful

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and powerful beyond measure.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
power that Gandhi

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
called satyagraha, the
power of love force,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
caring, the power of spirit.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is greater when
we create it together

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
than the power of materialism
and the power of the ego

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and the power of separation.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it's up to each
of us to find our calling,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to find our spirit, to find
our integrity, and to live it.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we're playing
the part in the greater healing

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
that we're meant to play.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:90%
