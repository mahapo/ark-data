00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The 1960s were
such a turbulent time.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And part of that turbulence
was due to the war in Vietnam

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that the United States
was propagating.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
student unrest and protest

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:90%
against the war.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Dr. King was a leader of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in
these protests myself.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And as the protests
grew stronger

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and there were throngs of
people outside the White House--

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson was
then the president.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%
His initials were LBJ.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were
chanting, hey, hey,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't like hearing that.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't like
all the pressure.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And he then decided, though
he was eligible as president

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
to run for re-election in
1968 and the obvious thing was

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:84%
for him to have done that and he
almost certainly would have won,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
he decided not to run.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And that left the
situation open.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Who would then be the
Democratic nominee?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And his vice president,
Hubert Humphrey,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle line:84%
assumed it would be
him, and he immediately

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
put his name in there
and was in the primaries.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But then Bobby Kennedy,
the younger brother

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
of the former president,
John F. Kennedy,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
who had been
assassinated in 1963--

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Bobby had been his
attorney general.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd become a
Senator from New York.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was opposed to
the war in Vietnam.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And he also championed a
lot of other good things.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
He was a very close friend with
CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez and Dolores Huerta,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
who ran the United Farm Workers.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was a real supporter of
human rights and civil rights.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that he
would run for the nomination

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
against Humphrey.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And as the primary
season went on,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
it became apparent that if
Bobby Kennedy won the California

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
primary in June of 1968,
he would be the nominee

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and presumably almost
certainly be the new president.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And my generation was
thrilled with this idea.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Kennedy, unlike
John F. Kennedy,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
unlike LBJ, unlike
Humphrey, was really a--

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:90%
he was a friend of Dr. King's.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
He was a friend of the
civil rights movement.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
He was a friend of the
protests against the war.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
He was a friend of the effort
to build a society that's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
based in social
justice, that's based

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
in something other
than obeisance

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.693 align:middle line:84%
to the military
industrial complex.

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And in June of
1968, Bobby Kennedy

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
won the California primary.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was a time of great
celebration for those of us

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
who aspired, as I did, towards
a peaceful world and the end

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to that war.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
However, at the
celebration that night,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:90%
the night of the primary--

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and Dolores Huerta was
right next to Bobby Kennedy

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
when this happened--

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:90%
he was assassinated.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
He was shot dead in the
hotel ballroom celebrating

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:90%
his victory.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then Humphrey
became the nominee

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and lost to Nixon, who
became the president in '68.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And my generation that
had worked so hard

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to protest this war, had forced
LBJ not to seek re-election,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
had risen up to support
Bobby Kennedy, who

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
would have been
the new president,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
we end up with Nixon as the
new president, who's worse

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%
than LBJ in every kind of way.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Nixon-- my father was delighted.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:90%
This is his close friend.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody
he really likes.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I was heartbroken.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
in my generation

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
were, that the war
would now continue.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Nixon escalated it.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.145 align:middle line:84%
I think the world now knows
who Richard Nixon was,

00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
what the quality
of his character

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.095 align:middle line:84%
was, what the quality
of his presidency was.

00:04:49.095 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It was very painful.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:90%
1968 was a heavy year.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
We lose Dr. King in April.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:90%
He's killed.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Bobby Kennedy is killed in June.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
In November, Nixon
wins the election.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:90%
What a turnaround.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It was so heavy
and heartbreaking

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
for our generation,
for those of us

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
who aspire to a better way
of life; an end to the war;

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:84%
a lessening of the power
of the war machine;

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a lessening of the greed
force in the world;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:84%
an awakening of
caring, compassion

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
as defining elements
of our public policies,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of our economic policies, of
our international policies,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of our lives, of
our communities.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a really hard blow to
take these series of things.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
five years previous

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that John F. Kennedy, Bobby's
older brother, had been killed.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
He was the president,
been assassinated.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
All these assassinations
in a short period

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of time of these major
figures, it's like--

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
controversy about who was

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:90%
behind these assassinations.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Was it Lee Harvey Oswald?

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Was it Jack Ruby?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of controversy.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I have my opinions.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has their opinions.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
What isn't a matter
of opinion, though,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is that these men were killed.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And this caused a rupture
in the fabric of society

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know if
it's ever been healed.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:58.725 align:middle line:84%
I know for myself, it was
clear that I need to--

00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been very involved in
these protests, civil rights

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:90%
movement, anti-war movement.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel like we
don't know what we're doing.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
We had the best of intentions
in protesting the war.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
We did succeed in
enforcing LBJ to resign.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
We did succeed in getting
Bobby Kennedy the support he

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:90%
needed to become president.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we end up with Nixon.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what we're doing.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel like
I need to go inside.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:90%
I need to meditate.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I need to do yoga.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I need to calm my
nervous system.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I need to learn to go as deep
inside as I want to go outside,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to change the world,
to stay in balance.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
generation needs to do

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
that because with the
best of intentions,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.425 align:middle line:90%
we now have President Nixon.

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:90%
So I began to think we need to--

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I need to meditate more, do
more yoga, do more inner work,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
do more therapy,
do more confronting

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
of my own inner demons, and
facing my own emotional issues

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
directly and get more centered,
more connected to spirit

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.425 align:middle line:84%
in order then to have an
impact on the world that

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
is a positive one, because
those were real tough times.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
