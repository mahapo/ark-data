00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle line:10%
[SOFT PIANO]

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:90%
- My dad loved money.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I can't say he loved me.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.980 align:middle line:90%
He did, in his way, I suppose.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Later in life.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:90%
he actually asked me once--

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.455 align:middle line:84%
much later-- "Do you think
all children need love?"

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Yes, dad, I do
think all children need love.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "That's
a new concept to me."

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how isolated
from your own feelings

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and your own heart
do you have to be

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:84%
to not know that every
child needs to be loved?

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say he
was a very loving man.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:90%
He didn't think about it.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't on his radar.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
he aspired to.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
He tended to put
away, push away,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
things like that he
called touchy-feely.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
hugging in my family.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.665 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember
him ever hugging me.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember any affection
between him and my mother.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.415 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember him
ever hugging my sisters.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:90%
So he was a pretty intact guy.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:90%
He held everything in.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And his energy was focused
on making money and selling

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:90%
ice cream and making flavors.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was his form of
expression and pretty much

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
his only one.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I very, very often
during my childhood

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
would ask my dad to tell me
stories about his childhood.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:90%
What was your dad like?

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Because his dad died when I
was one, so I never met him.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:90%
What was my grandfather like?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
What was your dad like?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
What happened during
your childhood?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%
What did you like doing?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:90%
What was exciting to you?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, whatever
you want to tell me.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And he would always say, "Why do
you have to analyze everything?"

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
He would say, "That's in
the past where it belongs."

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
He would say, "I don't
want to talk about it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have to
bring that up again?"

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know very, very
little about his childhood,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
despite asking
hundreds of times.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Because I felt I needed to know.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I felt he needed to tell me.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I felt he needed to know, but.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get to first
base with him on this.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
He just did not want
to talk about it.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I gathered, though.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know his father ever.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I knew his mother.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was a
pretty rigid person,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
authoritarian, demanding, pushy,
and somewhat narcissistic.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was hard for me to
picture him being loved by her.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I never saw any
affection between them.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I saw he took care
of her financially.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
He did his duty in that respect.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But I never saw
affection between them.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I saw her angry at him a number
of times, and I saw him cower.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was interesting to me
because he was a big guy, 6' 1",

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe 180, 190, 200 pounds.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
She was small.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was old, at least
from my perspective.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:90%
She was my grandmother.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.568 align:middle line:84%
And I was used to him being
in charge of everything.

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:90%
He was in charge of our family.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%
He was the patriarch.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
At the business, my
god, he was Mr. Robbins

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:90%
to all the employees.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
He called them by
their first names.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:90%
He was in command.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And he took command, in a way.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
He was a leader.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:90%
He really was in charge.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was used to him being
the boss, the one who

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
made the rules, enforced
them, and made things happen.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw him
with his mother.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And she'd start
complaining about something

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and she'd raise her voice,
and he'd just kind of shrink.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And he'd look like a little
boy to me, a hurt little boy.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, there's
a history to this.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
He's not that hurt just
because of what she just said.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:90%
There's some backstory here.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
There's some background
here in their relationship,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
in his experiences
during his childhood,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
but he wouldn't talk about it.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always experienced
that as a loss for me

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that I did not get to
know very much at all

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:90%
about my dad's childhood.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I can only speculate.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I can surmise.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I can put things that little
bits that I know together.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
One example of how disconnected
my dad was from his emotions

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and his heart was that when
his three children were born,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
in each case, he arranged
consciously and intentionally--

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:90%
and he spoke of this proudly--

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
to be out of town on business
when my mom went into labor.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
He not only didn't want to
be in the hospital with her.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
be in the same city.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.195 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
reason was that he

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to get sucked into
it in case something went wrong.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
So to me, I see two things.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
One, his incredible one-pointed
focus on his business.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
That was his priority number
one, two, three, four, five,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and six.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
His children weren't
and his wife wasn't.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And I also see the
fear of intimacy,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
the fear of being present.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Sure, there's pain in labor.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
There is the possibility that
something could go wrong.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Another man might have
said, oh, my god, something

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
could go wrong.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.208 align:middle line:84%
I want to be there in case
it does, to be with my wife

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
if something happens that's
difficult or challenging or

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
painful or God forbid,
worse than that.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I want to be there.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't his way.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:90%
He used his money.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
He used all of his
resources and his powers

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:84%
to distance himself
from his own feelings,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
from anything that was
intimate or that required love.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And he was a doer.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:90%
He got things done.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:90%
He gave orders.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to do that.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
He liked being in control.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.382 align:middle line:90%
And I do, too.

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us
like being in control.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's kind of an illusion.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We aren't as in control as
we like to think we are.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think he sensed
that if he was present,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
even in the hospital--
it's just in the hospital--

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
when my mother gave birth
to one of their children,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't be in control.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he wanted
anything to do with that.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.186 align:middle line:84%
And I often think of my mother
going through childbirth.

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
This was before the day
of conscious childbirth.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
She was drugged
heavily and all that.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But she went through it with
him out of town each time.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And although she never talked
about this that I know of,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what that did to her.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I think a woman in labor needs
emotional support of every kind.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Her sisters, if there's
loving connections,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
her friends, if they're
loving, intimate connections,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
her husband, the
father of her children,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
if there's a loving
connection, should

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
be there to support, to
celebrate the life that's

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
coming forth, to be there
for the pain, the struggle,

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
the effort, the
labor, the difficulty,

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
to be in solidarity with her.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a terrible
loss when that doesn't happen.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.408 align:middle line:84%
But for my dad,
that was his choice.

00:08:50.408 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
For my dad, that was
his way of maintaining

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
his emotional safety.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
That was the way he felt
safest, more in control, best.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he made that
choice for himself.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he
had any awareness at all

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
because I heard him talk
about this with some pride.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, wasn't that smart of me?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
he had it never

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
occurred to him that my mom
might have wanted him there,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
needed him there.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say that.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:90%
But I think it was true anyway.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
fathers were more present

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
for the birth of their children,
we'd have stronger families,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
we'd have stronger father-son,
father-daughter relationships.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We'd have more respect
for the feminine.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We'd have more respect
for what birth is.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'd be
a healthier society.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to create a more
compassionate world, a more

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
caring world, it starts with
the way we treat our children.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It starts at childbirth,
maybe even before childbirth,

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
during pregnancy.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It starts with how we work
with the pain we carry.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Because hurt people hurt others.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And if we've been hurt,
we have to deal with that.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring
compassion to our own pain,

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
to our own anguish, to our own
fear, to our own self-hatred,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and find a way to live with
it with compassion and caring

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't perpetuate the
cycle of violence and distress

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and pain.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's hard to do.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of us succeed
more than others.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of us succeed
in one area of our life

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and not in another.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.777 align:middle line:90%
But we're working on it.

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
important that we as individuals

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
work on that so that
our impact on the world

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
can be as positive and
beautiful as possible.
