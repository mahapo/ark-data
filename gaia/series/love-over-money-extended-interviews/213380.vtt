00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> My dad developed a saying
in his last few months,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.026 align:middle line:84%
"There are no luggage
racks on hearses,"

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
by which he was referring to the
fact that you can't take it with

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:84%
When you die, whatever you own
stays in the world, the material

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:84%
world, and gets distributed
however you deem it to go.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:90%
But you don't take it with you.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And he knew that.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
He did have a private large
suite in the hospital.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen
anything like it.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But his deathbed was in a
very large, spacious suite

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
with its own private bathroom
and a couch and a little kitchen

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
area and a separate wing
over here for another bed,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and not for another patient
but for a family member.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And my sister told me that he
wrote a check for $1 million

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
to the hospital in those
final days as a donation.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
My dad was dying from a
rare type of leukemia,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.426 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't manufacturing
red blood cells anymore.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And he had to be receiving
transfusions constantly,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a painful and
time-consuming procedure.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the hospital
receiving transfusions almost

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.127 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes thought
maybe he's setting

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
the world record for
transfusions because he's just--

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
every day, every other
day, more-- another one.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And the blood products that were
used came from donated blood.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And in our country, the
people who donate blood

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
are people who--
for the most part,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
are people who are poor and
need the money that they

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
get for donating their blood.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are
people of color.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them are people
of very little financial means.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are homeless.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
These are the people that he
tended to disdain in his life.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet, their blood was
circulating through his veins

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and keeping him alive.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
wondering if--

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.185 align:middle line:84%
because we know that when
people get organ transplants,

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
they will sometimes take on
some of the characteristics

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and qualities and even
memories of the donor,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
the person whose liver or heart
now makes them possible to live

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and now lives in their bodies.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, we
know that about organs.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of any
literature about that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
with blood transfusions.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But he got so many of them, I
wondered if some of what made

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
possible his opening to love, to
caring at a level that he never

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
had before-- at least
that I ever saw--

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
was because of receiving
these transfusions from people

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
who didn't have money, who
knew that the wealth they had

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in their lives was
the relationships

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
they had because they
didn't have anything else.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I have sometimes thought
that as a society,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
we forget the importance
and value of people.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.675 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to love
things and use people.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
What if we were to use
things and love people?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
have known that historically.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And in our society, it's
kind of an aberration.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We've become so
excessively materialistic

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have forgotten the
treasures we have in each other.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.727 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten the gifts
we have to give one another

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and to receive from one another.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is what makes
life beautiful for us.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And the accumulation
of material things

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in the absence of meaningful
and loving relationships

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
leaves a person
feeling very empty

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and even feeling like
their life has no meaning.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
In the 12-step programs, they
refer that each of us has

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:90%
a higher power.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Religions, of course, will
call that God or whatever.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But whatever language
you use, I think--

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I experienced that.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
My life has been guided
by a higher power.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.913 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not attached to
whatever language you

00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
want to use around
that or anybody

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
wants to use around that.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it was everything.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And to learn to listen, to be
quiet enough, to quiet my mind,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
open my heart, tune in, and
listen, listen to the silence.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the silence, to
hear the callings of life.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
My understanding was that if
we can quiet our minds enough

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and open our hearts and listen,
our calling will find us.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Our calling will come to us.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
go out and find it.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't inclined to go guru
searching or guru shopping

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:90%
or try this cult or that one.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
My inclination was to become
quiet and listen and let

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:90%
things unfold from there.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.345 align:middle line:84%
And there was a faith in
that or a trust in that.

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think my calling
did come and did find me.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to awaken people--

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
all of us, really-- to
the deeper American dream,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
which is not about
building a bigger pile

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and being better
than other people.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about something different
than that and something

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
much more beautiful and much
more connected to the Earth

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and much more ecologically
attuned and much more healthy

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and much more
beautiful and caring.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
There's more
happening in our lives

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
than we know because
whatever force

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
it was that was moving through
him at that time, that enabled

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
him to let down his walls that
much at that moment, that force,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.315 align:middle line:84%
that energy is
moving in the world.

00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's moving through all
of our minds and hearts

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
if we let it, if we can
find it, if we can heed it.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It has a wisdom.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we can make our
actions and lives congruent

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
with that force and that wisdom,
we can create a new world.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world worthy
of the suffering and the pain

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:90%
that all of us go through.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world worthy
of the dreams of our children

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and the dreams of all children.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world
that doesn't destroy

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
the planet for us to prosper.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world
where love prevails.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:90%
