00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:10.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have a lot of
memories of the first couple

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:90%
of years of my life.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that we lived
in a house in Glendale

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:90%
when I was born.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I know we moved from that house
to a much larger house in North

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood when I was three.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
And most of my early
memories are from that house.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was a very nice house.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So already, by the time my
earliest memories are there,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
money is starting to
come into the family.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.395 align:middle line:84%
I suspect when I was born,
that was not so much the case.

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But my dad was pretty
good at what he did.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And he did make money
starting pretty quickly.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with every year
that passed, there was more--

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
brand new cars every year and
Cadillacs and then, soon enough,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Rolls-Royces and live-in help
and live-in maids and put on--

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
expand the property, build
more rooms, build more

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
this, mink coats for
my mom, diamonds.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
growing every year.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think for my parents, they
were just thrilled with this.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They were just
tickled pink that they

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
were becoming affluent and
more and more affluent.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And they were just on a ride.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And as a kid, though, I don't
know that children really

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
care that much how
wealthy their parents are.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The toys that my parents,
the new car, the Rolls-Royces

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't mean anything
to me as a little boy.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted was
time with my dad.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have that much.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:90%
He was so busy at the company.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
He did want me, from my earliest
childhood-- some of my earliest

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
memories are of him talking
to me about, someday,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:90%
this will be yours.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I had sisters, but I
didn't have any brothers.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
patriarchal guy, kind

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
of old-fashioned in that way.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He didn't believe that
women should work.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
He believed that women should
be married and taken care of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and owned by their
husbands and not

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:90%
be self-sufficient in any way.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
That was just the
thinking of the time.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty outdated now,
I think, fortunately,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%
but that's how he believed.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So he never even thought for
a moment of offering either

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
of my sisters any
role in the company.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
My father was born in
Winnipeg, Canada in 1917.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And his parents had emigrated
to Canada from Russia.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
They were Jewish people.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Their last name was not Robbins.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It was Rabinowitz and my father
was born Irvine Rabinowitz.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was his name until he
was about five, at which point

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
their family moved
to the States,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
moved to Tacoma,
Washington, and changed

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:90%
their last name to Robbins.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to assimilate.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
be known as Jews.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And the name Rabinowitz
kind of gave that away.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were
wanting to normalize.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
They were wanting to actually
shed their Jewish past

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they remained
members of a temple,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't practicing
Judaism very much.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
My father's religion
really was capitalism.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:90%
His god was in his wallet.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And he looked to his bank
account for security.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was really committed
to making a lot of money.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I think his sense of security
in the world depended on it.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
true historically

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of Jewish people.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
If you go back a ways, you
see the Jewish people were not

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%
allowed to own land.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So the only way they
could retain wealth

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:90%
was with actual money.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't have real estate.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't own property.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of kept them
in finding their security

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.445 align:middle line:90%
in actually having cash.

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly how
much that affected my dad.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:90%
He fought in World War II.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:90%
He was terrified of the Nazis.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:90%
He hated them.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
He feared them.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
He was relieved when the
German army was defeated,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
as was probably a lot of
people in the caring world,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that this evil, this
particular manifestation

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:90%
of this intense evil was gone.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But the potential for evil,
the potential for anti-Semitism

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that the Nazis had manifested
still was in the world.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the potential
for hatred and fear

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
to run human affairs, to
take over governments,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:90%
we'd seen that happen.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And the fear that could
happen again, well, I think it

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
was very much on his mind.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And so his response was, make
as much money as you can.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And he went about doing
that through manufacturing

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and selling ice cream.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, my dad did
not grow up with money.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was proud of the
fact that he made a lot.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And he dedicated
himself to that.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And he achieved that.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And he felt good about
himself for that.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't begrudge
him that at all.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I admire that he
achieved what he wanted.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I do think, though,
that there were

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
inner needs, emotional needs
that he had that never did

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
get addressed in his life, that
he kept at bay, for the most

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.915 align:middle line:90%
And that was his choice.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the life he lived.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't judge it.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to judge it?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what I wanted
to do, but I built my life

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:90%
on the experiences that I had.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I had the privilege
of having a front row

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
seat to wealth, seeing that
money doesn't buy happiness

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:90%
no matter how much you have.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have that phrase,
money can't buy happiness,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and we give it lip service.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But most people, if you look
at their lives and the choices

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:90%
they make, they think it can.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
And it can't.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of got
to see that early

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because if money could
have bought happiness,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:84%
my parents would have
been happy people.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were not,
not to my eyes.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
They were happy with-- they
made the choices they made,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and they were happy with
their lives in that it

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled the needs they were
trying to fulfill with them.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't something
that I was called to.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad that I
didn't do the obvious thing

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and succumb because
that's what it

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
would have been for me to the
lure of the almighty dollar.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I went for some other
lure, something much,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to me, much brighter, more
difficult, more meaningful.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Later in my life, I
have met with groups

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of people who've come
from different backgrounds

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and different
economic backgrounds.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we've
done an exercise

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
or played a game in which
we ask those people who

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
had a certain experience
during their childhood

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:90%
to raise their hand.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
look around and see

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
who else had that
experience that you did,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:90%
if you're raising your hand.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions we ask
is, who was lonely as a child?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, the hands
go up from the kids,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in general, who came from
more affluent backgrounds.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
How many of you were
hungry as a child?

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:90%
The other hands go up.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kids who
come from backgrounds where

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't enough money.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
lonely, as a rule.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
There are exceptions, of
course, but as a rule.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And remarkably,
this is held true.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this in so
many different groups.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
There is something about the way
we use money that isolates us.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think people want to
isolate from their own pain

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and isolate from
the world's pain.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I'm
in rebellion against.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it serves
any of our hearts.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
actually contributing

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to the destruction
of the environment

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and to the damaging
of the human spirit

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and to a lot of
suffering in the world.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
For all I know, if I had
been born when he was,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
if I had had the
experiences he had,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I might have done
the same thing.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people did.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I felt it was sad that he
couldn't see when he had enough.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a day late in his
life when I was talking to him,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and he said to me, you know,
Johnny, I have so much money,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't spend it all before
I died no matter what I did.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dad, that's
been true for 30 years.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah, that's true.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.195 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just realizing it now.

00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:41.725 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I did think it
would have been nice

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
if he'd realized it 30 years
earlier because it was true.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe he could have
said, "I have enough.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I can give.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to give?"

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and made that the
art form, that he

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:84%
brought that focus
and that tenacity

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and that perseverance and
that power that he had.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
He used it to build
this ice cream company.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
What if that same power had
been used on behalf of healing

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't his way.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
He used his money, he used all
of his resources and his powers

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
to distance himself
from his own feelings,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
from anything that was
intimate or that required love.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that would be
a reward of wealth that would

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:90%
be worthwhile, you could give.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.453 align:middle line:84%
You know the joy
of service, the joy

00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
of contributing to
other people's lives,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the joy of making a difference
in other people's lives?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, brings
fulfillment and great joy.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So the person who doesn't
know how to do that

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
doesn't experience that
joy, that fulfillment.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's a loss.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they could afford it, and
they don't know how to do it,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and their values are such--
or their emotional background

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is such that they're
still kind of stuck

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in building the bigger pile
and competing and using money

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to make more money and not
looking at the good they

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:90%
could do, well, we all lose.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:90%
