00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In my home, as a child,
during my childhood,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
my parents had
help, living help,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.880 align:middle line:84%
maids and different
other types of staff.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were sometimes
people of color.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were the only
people of color I knew.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
My parents were all white.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
My parents' friends
were all affluent.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And these people often weren't
white, not always, but often.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
They were never affluent.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And they lived in my house.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And I saw how they were treated.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't do
anything about it.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:90%
But I hated it.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
They were treated
as less than human.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.145 align:middle line:84%
Their needs, their feelings were
not part of any conversation

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:13.945 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how other wealthy
families treat live-in help.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.913 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Baskins had
a similar situation.

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
They treated their

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.985 align:middle line:84%
help better, not great
at all, but better.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why my
mother was as cruel

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:90%
as she was to these people.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
They would last two weeks,
a month, two months,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
quit because they couldn't
tolerate the conditions.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Then new ones would come in,
and it was a revolving door.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what was
going to happen.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
They'd come in with
bright, bright eyes,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.948 align:middle line:84%
and good intentions,
and a new job.

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to do their best.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
impress, and try to help,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and take care of whatever they
were asked to take care of.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
They came with goodwill.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They came with good heart.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't last.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And so understandably
to me because I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:90%
saw how my mom treated them.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a rising in
me in response to this.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't express it.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Feelings about social and
economic justice, feelings

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
about what a power differential,
that when it's really gross,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:90%
does to everybody involved.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I was so inspired by everything
about Dr. King, his values,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
his commitment, his
service, his willingness

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to suffer on behalf of the
greater good, his eloquence,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:90%
his inspirational power.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I never, ever
would think anyone else

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
could do what he did.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But I tried, in my way, to be a
drop in the bucket that he was,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:90%
the ocean.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.205 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I certainly,
there were times

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:34.455 align:middle line:90%
when I didn't know what to do.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I was confused.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.335 align:middle line:90%
I was being attacked.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.798 align:middle line:84%
That this was happening,
and that was happening.

00:03:38.798 --> 00:03:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And things were rough at times.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would sometimes, in my
private moments, ask myself,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:90%
what would Dr. King do?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Not because I deified
him, not because I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
thought he is a
Christ-like figure

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and is beyond the human
experience, but because he was,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, he brought
a light, and a passion,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and a clarity, and a beauty, and
a commitment that lived in me.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be true to
that as much as I could.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
My mother was oblivious to
the feelings, and needs,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and humanity of these people.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
To her, they were just
means to her ends.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
She had objectified
them so totally.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
They just were
there to serve her.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they
happened to be human beings

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
was pretty much irrelevant to
her, at best, an annoyance.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And I saw what that
did to these folks.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I identified more with them
than with my parents, by far.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that all kids
would have done that, but I did.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw
them hurting badly,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and I heard them crying in
their room, lonely and afraid.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm crying in my
room because I'm lonely

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes I'm afraid.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how to bridge that.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't go to them.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm told not to.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
The rules are, we're
supposed to keep separate.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.045 align:middle line:84%
If I break that rule, they're
going to be uncomfortable.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how to
deal with that because they're

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:90%
told what the rules are.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
By no means, by the way, do I
think the Civil Rights movement

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:90%
succeeded in the '60s.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were
successes, thank God.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But we still have pervasive
racism in this country.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And people who exalt
the memory of Dr. King

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and think, he did it, we
don't have to are wrong.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
their eyes open.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Because all you have to
do is just look around

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and you see how people of color
are treated in this country

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:90%
still.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.125 align:middle line:90%
And it's a disgrace.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But it showed me the
emptiness of wealth.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that
wealth by itself--

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
a saying that there

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
are some people who are so poor
that all they have is money.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Just having money doesn't
guarantee that you have a heart.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all have hearts.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:90%
But we can shut them down.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:90%
We can block them off.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
We can push them away.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:90%
We can squeeze them tight.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
We can defend against them.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We can forget our obligation
to care for each other.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we use the money to
buy stuff we don't really need,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.430 align:middle line:90%
don't even want that much.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember the day my
dad bought my mother

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
a full-length, ermine-type of
mink, the most expensive type

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:90%
of mink coat.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it cost.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
We lived in Southern California.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a hot place.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
This coat, it was really thick.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Why would you ever?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:90%
It never got cold there.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was a status symbol.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a sign, a way of
saying how much money we have.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the
purchases that they made

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
seemed to me to be about saying
to the world, we've made it,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:90%
we're rich.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:90%
We've got this car.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
We've got this coat.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got this whatever, this
yacht, this private plane.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And aren't we great?

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I
don't feel very good.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, I'm
lonely and sad.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing people
mistreated around me.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel treated very well.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a better
way to live on this Earth.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are many
people who aspire to money

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%
because they haven't had it.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And they think, if
only I had more money,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:90%
my life would be easier.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And in many cases, that is true.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
If your basic needs aren't being
made, money is what you need.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.118 align:middle line:84%
But at past a certain
point, and my parents

00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:90%
were way past that point.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
How about Maslow's hierarchy of
needs kicking in, and asking,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.305 align:middle line:84%
since I have abundance,
what can I give?

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:37.305 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thought
didn't occur to my parents.

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:41.133 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was sad
for me, deeply sad,

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and also was an impetus for
me to live a different way

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and have different goals,
different aspirations,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
different commitments,
look for something else,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
looking for a deeper American
dream, a deeper dream in which

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
all beings could share.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:90%
