00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.260 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was in a supermarket,
grocery store of some kind.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.735 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little kiosk
with some paperback books.

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was a bit
bored, and then I

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
started looking
through the books.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was one,
and the title of it

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:84%
was Books That
Changed The World.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that title,
I just read the title.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt a shiver go
up and down my spine.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The hair on the back
of my neck stood up.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You mean books can
change the world?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Because I love to read.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Books can actually
change the world?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Books have changed the world?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a book about books
that have changed the world?

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Books have changed the world?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
That idea was just
riveting to me.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.473 align:middle line:90%
And I started to think, wow.

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
world than I know,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
a world that can be changed
by books, by thinking,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%
by deep thoughts.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading, at
the time, two books

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:90%
that really meant a lot to me.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And one was the Essays
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And a particular essay on
self-reliance, basically saying,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
be true to yourself.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I took that
very much to heart.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I loved hearing that from him.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It was what I needed to hear.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I sensed that if my parents
knew what Emerson was saying,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
they would forbid
me to read the book.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It felt like really
revolutionary.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept Emerson's Essays
between my mattress and box

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
spring, where they
would never see it.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.222 align:middle line:90%
And it got badly squished.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I still have that
book, by the way.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
The binding is all squished
because I slept on it.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But I would pull it out and
read it, and then put it back.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
like this is covert.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other book,
1962, was published,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I read that book
when it first came out.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my God.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:90%
It was so poetic.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And it spoke.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
She had this knack of
helping me as a reader feel

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
connected to the natural world,
in a way that I never had,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and also to know
about the peril we

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
were in with the introduction of
pesticides and toxic chemicals.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The book's title
came from the reality

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that she was presenting, that if
we continued on the path we were

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
with pesticide-based
agriculture,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
a spring would come, and there
would be no birds singing.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
No birds would
come back in spring

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
because they were all
dying from the pesticides

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
we were using, starting
to use to grow our food.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I, at that very, very early
age, started to think about,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
can we grow our food
without poisons?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that even possible?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Can we feed the world
without poisons?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.042 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want
to kill all the birds.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
live in the world

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
that Rachel Carson
introduced me to.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And so those two books,
Rachel Carson's book.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Silent Spring.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And Emerson's Essays,
and some other books

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that I read, I was thinking,
I wonder what other books

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll encounter in my life
that will change the world

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:90%
or that are changing the world.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And that fact that books can
change the world just lit me up.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a sense of
hope and possibility.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.668 align:middle line:84%
Not that I had the
thought, I'm going

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to write a book that
will change the world.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't conceive of that.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But that there were people
who were doing that.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And Emerson clearly was one,
and Rachel Carson was one.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was thinking, oh my.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The world suddenly
was brighter for me,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
a brighter place, a world
that could put it back.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew the kinds of
people that we have in it.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are pretty dark.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But if our world
can, and our species

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
can produce a Rachel
Carson, or an Emerson,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or eventually, by
the way, that's

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
how I felt about Dr.
Martin Luther King, who

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege of knowing
and being profoundly inspired

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
by.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If our species is capable of
being that, there is hope.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:90%
There is hope for us all.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
We're not all going to
be Martin Luther Kings.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.788 align:middle line:84%
We're not all going
to be Rachel Carsons.

00:05:03.788 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But if that's part of
our common humanity,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
then we can all
be more like that.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
We can all aspire
in that direction.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We can all see our way
towards being more that way.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And that gave me hope.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that I
would write a book that

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
would change the world.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that I would
follow in the footsteps of some

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
I so admired and had

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
been so inspirational to me.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I only knew then that
the respectful thing

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to do, for myself
and for my dad,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
was to not be Mr. Robbins,
with special treatment,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
but to be a member
of the human race,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
with my flaws, and
complications, and defects,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.537 align:middle line:84%
to work on life to
live on its own terms.

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure Deo had
a lot to do with that.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But living in nature,
connecting to the natural world,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.925 align:middle line:84%
putting our roots down
into the natural world,

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
that was something I

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
had wanted to do, ever since
I read Rachel Carson's book.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And getting to know the deer,
getting to know the birds,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
getting to know the animals,
I would meditate outside,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and the deer would come.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
afraid of people.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would graze
right next to me.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And I would meditate.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I would listen to them chewing.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would open my
eyes and look at them.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't afraid of me.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And it would just
be right there.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like the beauty
of the natural world

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
was here with me, was
feeding me, was restoring me.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.163 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of us today miss--

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
we don't know that we
miss it, but we actually

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
do miss connection
to the wilderness

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and its fertility, its beauty,
its ability to rejuvenate us.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
know what I was doing.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But we were learning how
to live with the Earth,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
as part of the Earth,
instead of on top of cement,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and streets, and cars, and
billboards, and flashy this

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and that, and materialism,
and the war machine,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
and the greed force.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
We were doing something much
simpler, much more basically

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
human, much more difficult.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
That was an underlying reality.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mostly, we're
focused on what's

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
the immediate needs
of the moment.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But in the background was,
yes, I had left all that.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was glad that I had.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was glad that I had the
opportunity to have a cabin,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to have the time to
meditate and do yoga.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a privilege.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It didn't cost a
lot of money to live

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the way we did because
it was very inexpensive.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And my poker and bridge
winnings lasted a while.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I began teaching
yoga and leading yoga workshops.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:90%
And we got income that way.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot, but it was enough.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:90%
And we got by.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Neither of us aspired
to the conventional idea

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:90%
of the good life.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We were creating our own version
of the good life, a newer

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
kind of good life
and an older one, one

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that has its roots
in human experience

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that goes back forever.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't aspire towards
the conventional good life

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:90%
because I'd grown up in it.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the emptiness
that could be there,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and I just didn't
want a part of it.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Deo did not grow up wealthy.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was different for her.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't have
expensive taste.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And she loved me, and
she was willing to put up

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
with all of this because
she loved me so much.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And because she also was
drawn to a way of life that

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
was in accord with
the natural world

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and didn't exploit and depend
on exploitation, at its root.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:90%
