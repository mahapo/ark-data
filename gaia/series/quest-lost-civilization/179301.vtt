00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I've come to investigate
an underwater mystery that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
could simply rewrite history.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a
temple, but the last time

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
it was above water
was 10,000 years ago.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
If it is man-made, it's
the oldest known structure

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe it could prove
the existence of a lost

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
My search begins in Cambodia,
1,000 miles south of Japan.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm at the great
temple of Angkor Wat.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm here with the photographer,
Santha Faiia, my wife,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:10%
to record an astronomical effect
that occurs only twice a year.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
On the 21st of March and
the 21st of September,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
when night and day
are of equal length,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Angkor lights up like
a fairytale kingdom.

At dawn we can witness
the brilliant planning

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
of the master architects
and astronomers who

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
suddenly appeared in Cambodia
just over 1,000 years ago.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious southeast
Asian civilization

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
has unexplained similarities
to a civilization ancient Egypt

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.265 align:middle line:90%
and ancient Mexico.

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:11.804 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I've come here to
look for answers

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
to a series of questions
raised by my research.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, all three of
these supposedly unconnected

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
civilizations used pyramids
in their sacred architecture.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
All three worshipped
kings as gods.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The religion of all
three focused on a quest

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
for the immortality
of the human soul.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
The priests of all three were
sophisticated astronomers

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
with advanced knowledge of
the cycles of the stars.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence
that poisonous snakes

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
were sacred here, just as they
were in ancient Egypt, just

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
as they were in ancient Mexico?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Finally, is it a coincidence
that all three regions

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
were believed by their
inhabitants to contain

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.012 align:middle line:90%
a hidden image of the heavens?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
For 10 years I've been
trying to piece together

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.242 align:middle line:84%
a puzzle drawn from every
corner of the ancient world.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:34.098 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I became interested
when I realized

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:84%
just how similar many of
these ancient cultures were,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
even though they were
living at different times

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and were often separated
by huge expanses of ocean.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:90%
All sought to reach for the sky.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
All align their monuments
to the stars and the sun.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.742 align:middle line:84%
Now modern technology is helping
us to fathom their purpose.

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It turns out they were
copying images of the sky

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.468 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Long before the
mysterious buildings

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
appeared in Cambodia, the
ancient Egyptians aligned

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.865 align:middle line:84%
their temples to the
sun on special days.

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I've come to the Temple
of Karnak in Upper Egypt.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Like a sniper's rifle,
its long, narrow access

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
targets the sun at dawn
on the winter solstice,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
the 21st of December, the
shortest day of the year.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
What we've just witnessed
is a piece of cosmic magic,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
a spell cast almost
4,000 years ago

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
by the master
astronomers and master

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
architects of ancient Egypt.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It astonishes me
that Egyptologists so

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
despise and so underestimate
the ancient Egyptians

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that they can only see
this magnificent effect

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
as some sort of accident,
some sort of coincidence.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a coincidence.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:84%
By connecting the axis
of Karnak so precisely

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to the rising sun on
the winter solstice,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians were
trying to join ground and sky.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
The effect is to transform
the entire temple

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
into a gateway to the
heavens, and that's

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.245 align:middle line:84%
precisely what they called
it in their religious texts.

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
To get to grips with
the Egyptian obsession

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
with the sky, we need to travel
100 miles north to Dendera,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
built 2,000 years ago.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Dendera is an
astronomical temple.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It stands on the
foundations of a series

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:90%
of much earlier temples.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.856 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Continuous rebuilding
on ancient sites

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
meant that very old
ideas were constantly

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:90%
re-expressed in new forms.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
These ideas were traced back
by the Egyptians themselves

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to the remote Golden Age
called the First Time

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and to a single temple believed
to have been built by the gods.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
This whole temple was
modeled on a precise region

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.741 align:middle line:90%
of the sky known as the Duat.

00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.447 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.447 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The Duat occupied
a special place

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egyptian religion.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
It was the place
through which our souls

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%
must travel after death.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It was ruled over
by the god Osiris

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and identified with specific
constellations of stars,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
so the ancient Egyptians
saw sacred knowledge of it

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.625 align:middle line:90%
through the study of astrology.

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Covering every square
inch of the ceiling

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
are images of all 12 of the
constellations of the zodiac.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
As every follower
of astrology knows,

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
there are 12 constellations
or collections

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:90%
of stars known as the zodiac.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:10%
The zodiac can be visualized
as a giant belt which

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:10%
surrounds us.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Because the Earth moves
around the sun, each month

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:10%
as the sun rises, we see
a different constellation

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:10%
like Cancer the crab
or Leo the lion.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that knowledge of the
zodiac expressed in this temple

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.325 align:middle line:84%
was present in Egypt
from the earliest times.

00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:24.542 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think there's no
question from the evidence that

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.291 align:middle line:10%
we have, particularly in the
monuments because they are

00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:10%
the most enduring record, that
their knowledge of the cosmos,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:10%
of the stars, the star patterns,
the cycles of the cosmos,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:10%
was enormous and exact.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
We have enough evidence
today to verify that.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
The way that the ancients
reflected that information

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:84%
was in a picture thinking
or a mythological thinking.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
For them there was
no contradiction,

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
as there is for us, between
exact astronomical knowledge

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and mythological
stories because they

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.202 align:middle line:90%
thought in a mythological way.

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
their brains worked.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The ideas we find at Dendera
appear 1,000 years earlier

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
in the tombs of the
Valley of the Kings.

Entering into the burial
chamber of Seti the First,

one of the great
pharaohs of Egypt,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
what immediately strikes
me is the profusion

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of astronomical
symbolism everywhere.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
An astronomical ceiling
lies over the burial place

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:84%
itself, a ceiling
populated by star gods

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and by symbols of
constellations still in forms

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.488 align:middle line:90%
that are recognizable today.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Who could doubt that the
ancient Egyptians conceived

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:84%
their afterlife journey as
being made amongst the stars?

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:90%

To the north, in the deserts
outside modern Cairo,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
are even earlier
astronomical clues.

1,500 years before
the first tombs

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
were built in the
Valley of the Kings,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians expressed
their astronomical wisdom

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.602 align:middle line:90%
in gigantic pyramids.

Djoser is supposedly

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the oldest in Egypt, the place
where pyramid building began

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:90%
about 5,000 years ago.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It's one of a group of important
pyramids sited that Saqqara,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
about 30 miles south of the
more famous pyramids of Giza.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The interior of the
Pyramid of the pharaoh Unas

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is inscribed with
extraordinary texts that

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:90%
offer a key to Egypt's mystery.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Entering this secret underworld,
the first thing you observe

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
stars everywhere.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling is covered in stars.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And this tells us that
the ancient Egyptian idea

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife was not a
place of darkness and death,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but a place of light and
immortality in the heavens.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
chapel of knowledge

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
because inscribed on the
walls are the oldest surviving

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
scriptures of mankind.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:10%
These texts were written down
more than 4,300 years ago

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:10%
from original
documents now long lost

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:10%
and from oral
traditions stretching

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:10%
far back beyond the
memory of historians.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
If we want to reach out
and connect ourselves

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
to the world of spiritual
ideas of our ancestors,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
to the forgotten past
of mankind, then surely

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.363 align:middle line:90%
this is the link.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we're
looking at the legacy of a lost

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:90%
civilization here?

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.394 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.394 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Osiris the
King, you have gone.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:90%
But you will return.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You have slept,
but you will awake.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.960 align:middle line:84%
You have died,
but you will live.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:90%
The tomb is opened for you.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
The doors of the coffin
are drawn back for you.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:84%
The doors of the sky
are thrown open for you.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
These texts are describing the
journey of the pharaoh's soul

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to the domain of Osiris
in the stars, to the Duat.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Duat lay close to the
constellation of Orion,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
which the Egyptians saw as
the image of their god Osiris.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The Duat's sign in hieroglyphs
was a star within a circle.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists translate
the hieroglyphs literally

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
as a series of magical spells.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't accept that
beneath the symbols

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
there's an astronomical
message, albeit one in code.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Yet, when we put these
text side by side

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:84%
with the uninscribed
Great Pyramids of Giza,

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.035 align:middle line:90%
the code can be broken.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, the Belgian
engineer Robert Bauval

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
published the details
of an amazing discovery

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
which overturned a
century of scholarship.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Bauval showed that some
of the oldest pyramids

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
were laid out to match the
patterns of significant stars.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Bauval is taking me to
the pyramid of Sneferu,

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the father of Khufu, who built
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
The architects who built
all these structures

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
belonged to an elite
school of priests.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a cult based
in Heliopolis,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
long since buried under the
suburbs of modern Cairo.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The priests of Heliopolis
who designed these projects were

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:10%
servicing a very important
cult, the belief that Egypt was

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:10%
in the image of heaven, that
the whole land of Egypt was

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:10%
a magical, cosmic land, and that
the pharaoh was representative

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:10%
of the cosmic
order on this land.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, a pharaoh was considered
to be the son of Osiris

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
living on Earth.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
When he died, he
joined back the gods

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, the
cosmic land, which

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:90%
was in the image of Egypt.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is in this
context that we

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
have to understand what
they were trying to do here.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What Bauval has done is to
re-examine the hieroglyphic

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
texts inscribed inside
the Pyramid of Unas.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pyramid Texts tell
us that there is a Nile

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, which is
obviously the Milky Way.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, here imagine the
course of the Nile here.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.725 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you look--

00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
one thing that got
me into this thing--

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the pattern of
the three pyramids of Giza,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
what I was looking at the
time was a peculiar offset

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
of the third, smaller pyramid
to the left of the diagonal

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:90%
of the first two.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I compared
the map of the three payments

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to the three star of the
belt of Orion, suddenly

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw a pattern.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems almost an
extraordinary idea that

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing the
sky down to the ground.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what
Egypt was all about.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.175 align:middle line:84%
The essence of the belief
is that Egypt was itself

00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic land, a land that
was the mirror of heaven.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> If the whole Giza Plateau
is a mirror of heaven,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
a model of stars on the ground,
then surely its most prominent

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
feature, the Pharaoh
Khufu's Great Pyramid,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
must be the key to
the whole design.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Most Egyptologists
believe the Great Pyramid

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
with its intricate network
of corridors and passageways

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:90%
was built as Khufu's tomb.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that Khufu built it
for another purpose altogether,

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:90%
a much more significant one.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And clues to that
purpose are embedded

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:90%
in the architecture itself.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the room conventionally
known as the Queen's Chamber.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's not
a shred of evidence

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that any queen or any body was
ever buried in this chamber.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the function
of this curious corbel niche

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
behind me, although it reflects
a pattern found elsewhere

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
One clue, however, may be
provided by this feature.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
If you'd entered
this room in 1871,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:84%
you would have seen
a sheer blank wall.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But in 1872, an enterprising
British engineer

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
walked around the room tapping
on the walls with a hammer

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.582 align:middle line:90%
and he found a hollow point.

00:18:27.582 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And he cut through
it with a chisel

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and found that there was
just five inches of stone

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
blocking the mouth
of this shaft.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval calculated
the angle of the shaft

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and found that it targets a
very significant star, the star

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.504 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, which the ancient
Egyptians identified

00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:90%
with the goddess Isis.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Isis was the mother figure
of the Egyptian gods,

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
so this is clearly
part of a pattern--

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
pyramids on the ground
matching the stars

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and the connecting line between.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Isis was the wife
of Osiris, Lord

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Duat, whose
astronomical image was

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
the constellation of Orion.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
High up in the Great
Pyramid, what's

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
known as the King's Chamber
connects with his stars

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It does so with two shafts
each precisely targeted

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.215 align:middle line:90%
on significant stars.

00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
If we travel through the Great
Pyramid in virtual reality,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can easily see the complex
system of passages, chambers,

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and shafts which remain a
baffling and unexplained

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:90%
engineering feat.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we ascend into
the King's Chamber,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
we find that it's the
southern shaft which

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.135 align:middle line:90%
is the most revealing.

00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:06.085 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.085 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
It points directly at
the stars of Orion's belt

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:90%
as they were in 2,500 BC.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It confirms Bauval's discovery
that these three stars

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
are exactly reflected in the
ground plan of the three Giza

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:90%
pyramids.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.878 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:23.878 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the Giza
pyramids are really

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:84%
part of a gigantic model
of the Duat sky region.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
They weren't tombs at all.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh came
here during life

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to learn about and prepare for
the journey through the Duat

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that he expected to
make after death.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid of
Egypt was nothing less

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:84%
than a flight simulator for the
pharaoh's journey to heaven.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Angkor, Cambodia.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
As in Egypt, there's evidence
that groups of temples

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
were built here as
models of specific stars

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.776 align:middle line:84%
and linked to the
quest for immortality.

00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The most famous
temple, Angkor Wat,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
was completed 800 years
ago, making it much later

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:90%
than any Egyptian temples.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But satellite
photographs have recently

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
identified much earlier
constructions at Angkor.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
As in Egypt, the builders
of the temples where master

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.784 align:middle line:90%
astronomers and mathematicians.

00:22:00.784 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Like the pyramids of
Giza, these temples

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
were an interface
between ground and sky.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's a
much deeper connection

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:90%
between Angkor and Giza.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
To prove it, I need to find
evidence of the same mirroring

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:90%
of stars on the ground.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
A journey into this
temple was a journey

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
into the mystery of
time and mathematics.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.883 align:middle line:84%
Pilgrims came here seeking
sacred enlightenment.

00:22:48.883 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:84%
At each level, they
were confronted

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:84%
by riddles which they must
overcome before passing on

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.232 align:middle line:84%
Just as at Giza, the purpose was
to acquire the knowledge that

00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:09.315 align:middle line:90%
would lead to immortality.

00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:12.115 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
An American expert on
Angkor, Dr. Eleanor Mannikka,

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the
ancient builders

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:84%
had used a consistent
unit of measure,

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
which she named the qubit.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Her survey showed that
every measure here

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
is scaled to cycles of time
important to Hindu beliefs.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Along the causeway to
the center of the temple,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the builders mark the first age
of Hindu cosmology, 1,728,000

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
years, expressed
as 1,728 qubits.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
That could be a coincidence,
but the site also

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
provides the second, third,
and fourth ages as well.

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:10%
These walls contain the
longest continuous stretch

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:10%
of embossed stonework anywhere.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a great work of art,
but it's much more than that.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It reveals as much about Angkor
as the hieroglyphs tell us

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:90%
about Egypt.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a scene that operates at
two distinct but interconnected

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:90%
On one level, it's scientific.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:90%
The other level is mythological.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
The myth is called the
Churning of the Milky Ocean.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The key ingredient is
the Milky ocean itself,

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the ocean upon which the entire
universe was thought to rest.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The churning post is this
mountain in the center

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
that we see roughly
outlined, Mt.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Mandara, one of the central
peaks of the cosmos according

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to Hindu mythology, and it
rests on the body of a tortoise.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And this tortoise is an
incarnation of the god Vishnu.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And we also see Vishnu
here in human form

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:90%
steadying the churning process.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The instrument of the churning
is the body of a great serpent,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
a Naga serpent
called Basuki, which

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:90%
is wrapped around the mountain.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
This serpent is operating
like a rope that's

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:84%
turning the mountain
and is pulled

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in two different directions by
two different teams of pullers,

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
one team representing the
forces of darkness and evil,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the other team representing
the forces of good and light.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a simple matter of
one team or the other winning.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:84%
What they are actually doing--
and a profound wisdom is

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:90%
concealed in this--

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is cooperating towards
a common objective,

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and that objective
is to generate

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
from the churning
of the Milky ocean

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:90%
the elixir of immortality.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
The scientific level of the
scene is much more complex

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and it rests on
detailed observations

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens carried
out by astronomers

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:90%
over vast periods of time.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It represents an intricate
cycle of the stars

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:90%
known as precession.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Two teams pulling
on the suit twisted

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
around the sacred mountain
symbolize a cycle of time

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that only very
sophisticated observers

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
could have understood.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:10%
It is, in fact, a scientific
metaphor for the way

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.356 align:middle line:10%
that the Earth spins on its
own axis in the heavens.

00:27:15.356 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
If you could speed up the
stars over an evening,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
you would notice that they
seem to revolve around

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:90%
the north pole of the sky.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
This is because the earth
revolves once every 24 hours.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But the position of the
North Pole isn't fixed.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because of a slow wobble
in the Earth's rotation

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.394 align:middle line:84%
like a spinning
top, the pole moves.

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:49.726 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It travels in a slow circle
around the still point

00:27:53.630 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
over 26,000 years, or one
degree every 72 years.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.365 align:middle line:84%
This cycle is known
as precession.

00:28:04.365 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:90%
We can measure it now.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, the ancients
could measure it then.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
We know they could
measure precession

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
because they encoded
processional numbers

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%
in the dimensions and
alignments of the temples.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It's no coincidence that there
are 72 temples at Angkor.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Nor is it a coincidence
that Angkor Wat's causeway

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:84%
is exactly 3/4 of a degree
offset from due east.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
In precessional terms, 3/4
of a degree takes 54 years

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and we find the number 54
repeating all over Angkor.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
The offset gave the
builders of Angkor

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.415 align:middle line:84%
a three-day warning
of the spring equinox.

00:29:02.415 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Only on the equinox, when night
and day are of equal length,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
does the rising sun line
up with the central tower.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe the builders of
Angkor used precessional numbers

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to commemorate their
most important ideas.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Immediately adjacent to
Angkor Wat is Angkor Thom.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And here, if we look,
is a clear message

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:90%
transmitted from the past.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
What I'm walking on
here isn't just a bridge

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:90%
lined with exotic statues.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's also a colossal
three-dimensional model

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:90%
of precession.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
What we have here, actually,
is a three-dimensional version

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of the bas relief in Angkor Wat.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We see the Asuras, the
spirits of evil, on one side

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and the spirits of
good on the other.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
pulling is that the Naga

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.179 align:middle line:84%
serpent Basuki, the Naga King,
who's churning the Milky ocean.

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Milky ocean is
actually represented

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:90%
by the moat on my right there.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
This churning of the Milky
ocean is a symbol of precession.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But just in case we're
in any doubt about it,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
they give us the
numbers of precession--

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:84%
54 figures on each side,
108 figures per bridge.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But five bridges-- and
there are five surrounding

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:84%
this complex-- times 108 makes
540, all precessional numbers.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The bridge leads to
a gateway, and what

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
this is telling us is
that the gateway itself

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and what lies beyond it
is in some way connected

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
to the mystery of precession.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a riddle here.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Angkor Thom is a vast
sacred enclosure,

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:84%
measuring over five
square miles an area.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.681 align:middle line:84%
At its center is a complex
temple known as the Bayon.

00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.015 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it stands in
the exact geometric center

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
suggests that it was
of special importance

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:90%
to the builders of Angkor.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.670 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient
myths which state

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that in some mysterious
manner, the land of Angkor

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
was once believed to
be similar to the sky.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.205 align:middle line:84%
I think the Bayon represents
the still point in heaven

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
around which the stars circle
in that great processional cycle

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:90%
of 26,000 years.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Here at the center
of the Bayon, I'm

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by 54 towers, the
processional number most used

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:05.920 align:middle line:90%
at Angkor.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:16.294 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.294 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a potent reminder that
the builders express themselves

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.846 align:middle line:90%
in processional numbers.

00:32:20.846 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But I believe their vision
was much grander than has

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:90%
hitherto been realized.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.035 align:middle line:84%
Their project was to create
a hidden image of the heavens

00:32:40.035 --> 00:32:41.160 align:middle line:90%
in the jungles of Cambodia.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:56.232 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.232 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:84%
A PhD student, John Grigsby,
doing research for me,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
discovered the crucial
evidence of a link

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:90%
between Angkor and Giza.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
He noticed that some of
the temples on the ground

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
matched the stars of the
constellation of Draco

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that
Egypt's pyramids mapped

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.565 align:middle line:90%
the stars of Orion.

00:33:15.565 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:10%
What Grigsby's saying
is that the layout

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.280 align:middle line:10%
of the pattern of these
pyramids on the ground

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:10%
looks like the stars in
the constellation of Draco

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:10%
so that Angkor Wat
would be the head

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:10%
of the constellation of Draco.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Through the Bayon would be the
heart of the constellation.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
You can see the body
coming up through here.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.630 align:middle line:84%
If you just joined the
dots between the temples,

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:84%
then you get this long tail
extending through here.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It could be a coincidence.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
It needs to work in the
sky and on the ground

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
We should be looking
for this correlation,

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
if it exists at all, on
the spring at Equinox

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.340 align:middle line:84%
because Angkor Wat is
an equinoctial temple.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And really, we should
be looking for it

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
in 1150 AD, which is when
Angkor Wat was built.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.949 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what
the computer says.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, Draco's a northern
constellation,

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:84%
so we need to look
in the northern sky.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:90%


00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And there is Draco.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.850 align:middle line:90%
However, it's upside down.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:90%
The head's up, the body's down.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the head
down, the body up.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel like I
want to turn the sky around.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:84%
I want to revolve the
whole sky and then

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a match between
sky and ground work.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.524 align:middle line:84%
Well, the most obvious way to do
it is look at Draco at sunset.

00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:90%
There's Draco coming down.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.614 align:middle line:84%
But at the time when it is
matching these structures,

00:34:48.614 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:84%
it's under the horizon which
means you just couldn't

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.860 align:middle line:90%
have seen it from Angkor.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's one
other way we can

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:90%
see if Draco lines up properly.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's to go back in time.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.579 align:middle line:84%
2,000 3,000, 4,000, 5,000,
6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000,

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
10,500 BC.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is very, very spooky.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:84%
That is very strange
because there it is--

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Draco.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
We find that the
constellation is in absolutely

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
the right position in the sky.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.837 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.837 --> 00:35:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The Angkor we see now was built
less than 1,000 years ago.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But the pattern of the
temples on the ground

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:84%
matches the sky image of
the constellation of Draco

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:90%
in 10,500 BC.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a mystery with
huge implications.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Far away in Egypt,
the Great Pyramids

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:84%
map the constellation of
Orion, which stands directly

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:90%
opposite Draco in the sky.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.556 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.556 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:84%
For the two most impressive
science of the ancient world

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to mirror that direct
opposites in heaven

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
must be the result
of a grand design.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.356 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is full of hints and
memories that connect it

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to an earlier age, the Golden
Age called the First Time.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the many
myths that speak of it

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:10%
refer to a real
era of prehistory

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and that astronomy may help
us to put a date on it.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Central to that far-off
era is the most famous god

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Egyptian
pantheon, the god Osiris.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is his temple,
built about 3,300 years ago.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The myths say Osiris
came down from heaven

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to rule Egypt in the
First Time and that he

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:90%
was the teacher of mankind.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Murdered by 72
conspirators, he was reborn

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.460 align:middle line:84%
as the star god Orion, ruling
over the afterlife kingdom

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.260 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:10%
His son, Horace, usually
depicted as falcon-headed,

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:10%
avenged the murder and restored
his father's Earthly kingdom.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
The pharaohs who
inherited that kingdom

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:84%
hoped to equip themselves to
make a journey after death

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to join Osiris in the
sky and become immortal.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Osiris had ruled
in the First Time.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And this notion of
time kept growing

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:90%
in my head-- time, time.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I began to feel that they
were telling us, in a way,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that the journey of the pharaoh
was to go to the First Time,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:90%
that it's--

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Bauval showed me
on the computer how he dated

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.075 align:middle line:90%
the First Time.

00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So not just a
journey to the stars,

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.273 align:middle line:84%
but a journey to the
stars in a specific time.

00:38:02.273 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:10%
>> In a specific time frame.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.690 align:middle line:10%
Osiris had come down to
Earth, had established

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:10%
that king of the First Time.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I began to see the pyramid
field as that kingdom.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And I began to reason
out where the stars do

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:84%
have the First Time through
the precession cycle and.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you get the
motion of precession,

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the effect on the
stars is that they

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
will reach a maximum height
and a minimum height.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a seesaw.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a seesaw, up and down.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So I decide to take the
stars down to their lowest

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
possible location, which
would imply a beginning

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of a cycle, the First Time.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And in order to do that,
you have to go back in time--

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Back in time.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> --on a computer.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.339 align:middle line:10%
>> So what you are saying is you
are open to the idea that they

00:38:54.339 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:10%
had understood precession, even
though all Egyptologists deny

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.436 align:middle line:84%
>> I am utterly convinced that
they understood precession.

00:38:59.436 --> 00:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also convinced that
either they have kept records

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
or they had the
process of passing

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.810 align:middle line:84%
through the knowledge
of the changing skies

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.451 align:middle line:84%
through the centuries from
generation to generation.

00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, the sky--

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:84%
What Bauval is suggesting
is that the pyramid builders

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of Giza in 2,500
BC must have known

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
about the patterns of the
stars as they had appeared

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:90%
in much more ancient times.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This could explain why the three
pyramids representing the three

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
stars of Orion's belt form
a diagonal of 45 degrees

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.810 align:middle line:90%
to due north-south.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.840 align:middle line:10%
Bauval established that the
stars on which the pyramids are

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:10%
modeled were last seen in this
arrangement in 10,500 BC, when

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:10%
they were at the lowest point
of the processional cycle,

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:10%
the First Time.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What the astronomy is telling
us is that we have to consider

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
the date of 10,500 BC.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Amazingly, that's
the exact date--

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:84%
10,500 BC-- spelled out by
the astronomy of Angkor.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll find that the stars
actually adjust themselves

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:84%
precisely in the pattern of
the pyramids on the ground.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.277 align:middle line:84%
I could not accept
this as a coincidence.

00:40:14.277 --> 00:40:18.013 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.013 --> 00:40:21.765 align:middle line:84%
They have designs, a scheme
that fitted the First Time.

00:40:21.765 --> 00:40:24.555 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing fitted.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh wanted to return
to the golden age of Osiris.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a land
locked in that time.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that the Pyramids
were completed around 2,500 BC,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
but use astronomy to commemorate
the First Time of 10,500 BC.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Great Sphinx, which
now needs constant repair,

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:84%
may actually be
thousands of years

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:90%
older than previously thought.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx is mute
and anonymous.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
There are no texts contemporary
with its construction

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that tell us who built
it or why it was built

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
or when it was built.
It leaves us guessing.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And in all honesty, it
leaves the Egyptologists

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:90%
guessing, too.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
They believe they know
when the Sphinx was built

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and who built it.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.677 align:middle line:84%
They believe it was
built in 2,500 BC,

00:41:22.677 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:90%
during the Fourth Dynasty.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that a
massive amount of work

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
was done at this site
during the Fourth Dynasty.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But is it safe to assume from
that that the Sphinx was also

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
built during the Fourth
Dynasty when no text tells us

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.480 align:middle line:90%
that it was?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.110 align:middle line:84%
One major clue comes from
the work of John Anthony West

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and Professor Robert Schoch
of Boston University.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They've shown that
these curious weathering

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.110 align:middle line:84%
patterns on the trench that
surrounds the Sphinx, which

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
was, of course, carved out at
the same time as the Sphinx

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.080 align:middle line:84%
itself, and on the
body of the Sphinx

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
could only have been caused by
exposure to thousands of years

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:90%
of heavy, heavy rainfall.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
These vertical fissures
are created by water

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
pouring down off the
edge of the plateau

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and cutting out a
vertical channel.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And these scooped,
undulating patterns

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
are characteristic of
rainfall weathering.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that in
2,500 BC, when Egyptologists

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.060 align:middle line:84%
think that the Sphinx
was built, Egypt

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was as bone dry as it is
today and the climate couldn't

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:84%
possibly have caused this
special kind of weathering.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back to a
time when Egypt was green

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and heavy rains fell on it
to find the conditions that

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:84%
could have weathered the
Sphinx and its enclosure

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.880 align:middle line:90%
in this special way.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was thousands of
years before the first pharaoh

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of the First Dynasty ever
sat on the throne of Egypt.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Basically, what you
have on the Giza Plateau,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:10%
which is on the
edge of the Sahara,

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.080 align:middle line:10%
are two different types
of erosional features--

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:10%
one we can correlate
with wind erosion,

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:10%
which is a damn original feature
today since it's a desert

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.090 align:middle line:10%
and you just have a lot of wind.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
other erosional feature

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:84%
which is correlated with
precipitation, with rain

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:90%
running down on the rocks.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have rain in
that area since about 3,000 BC.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you have this
erosional feature

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that erosional future happens
to be on the body of the Sphinx.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Initially, after a
week of informal work,

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Schoch was pretty well convinced
that the water weathering

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.170 align:middle line:10%
theory had to be correct.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We then went public with it
at the Geological Society

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:90%
of America's convention in 1991.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And that, of course, brought
all the press in and Schoch,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.020 align:middle line:10%
by this point, basically staked
his reputation on the water

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:10%
weathering to the Sphinx and the
implications that that carries.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Conservatively, I would
estimate the beginning

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx, oldest
portion of the Sphinx,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to 5,000 to 7,000 BC.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the number
I basically use.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Other people have pushed
it back even further.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.262 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it is possible
that it could be older.

00:44:15.262 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You know how many people
comes back to me every day with

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:90%
a theory?

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure many.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:22.340 align:middle line:10%
>> At least every day
that is one new theory.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:10%
If you will really
give permissions

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:10%
to everyone who have a
theory to investigate that,

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:10%
it will be, really, a riot
without evidence about--

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Zahi Hawass is Chief
Inspector of antiquities

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:10%
at Giza.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You've found a piece from
the land, and you've found--

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing gets done here
without his approval.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.890 align:middle line:84%
He's the country's most
influential Egyptologist.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:84%
He rejects any radical
re-dating of the Sphinx.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Hawass took me to parts of
the monument that are normally

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:90%
strictly off-limits.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.830 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to drive
home his opposition

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.340 align:middle line:90%
to the geological heresy.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If the heavy rain is
showing what's happening here

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
to the Sphinx,

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:84%
then this is what's
cut at the time.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really convinced
in that since Schoch

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.426 align:middle line:84%
is the only geologist
who is saying that.

00:45:18.426 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> He's been
supported by others.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Like who?

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Many hundreds, actually,
the Geological Congress

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:90%
of America--

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the same time, many
hundreds who came here really

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.180 align:middle line:84%
to see that on-site, they did
not really agree with that.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of geologists, they
see it as pretty self-evident

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:84%
or obvious once
they see the data.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Where I've run into oppositions
with the Egyptological,

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the classic Egyptologists
and a few geologists

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:84%
or geoarchaeologists
who have been working

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:84%
with the Egyptologists,
who in some cases

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.990 align:middle line:84%
have told me very bluntly they
never even considered that--

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:84%
they were going
under the assumption

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.156 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx was
such and such an age

00:46:00.156 --> 00:46:02.680 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the
Egyptologists told them.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> A Sphinx in that
time, 10,000 years ago,

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:08.810 align:middle line:84%
what kind of civilization
can do a Sphinx in that time?

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Both sides, your side as
well, are offering theories,

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:90%
not facts.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But my side is really
offering theories based on what

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.730 align:middle line:90%
we discover here.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.814 align:middle line:84%
All our fears is
connecting with archeology.

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But the theory of
the 10,000 years

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.780 align:middle line:84%
is connecting with
really nothing.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> They've been trying to pick
holes in it, unsuccessfully,

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.960 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, they don't like it.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.980 align:middle line:84%
They feel it's
one turf intruding

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.720 align:middle line:84%
on the turf, one
discipline intruding

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.198 align:middle line:90%
on another discipline.

00:46:40.198 --> 00:46:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The archaeologists and
the geologists can argue,

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
but when you add in the
discipline of astronomy,

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe the evidence for
an older Sphinx becomes

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.003 align:middle line:90%
assailable.

00:46:55.003 --> 00:46:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx is
aligned perfectly due

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
east with its gaze
targeting the rising sun

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.070 align:middle line:90%
at dawn on the spring equinox.

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I'd stood
here in 2,500 BC

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.270 align:middle line:84%
when the Sphinx is supposed
to have been built,

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:84%
gazing east in
line with its gaze

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.780 align:middle line:84%
at dawn on the spring
equinox, I would

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.260 align:middle line:84%
have seen the
constellation of Taurus

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the bull rising in direct line
with the gaze of the Sphinx.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The logic of the
astronomy suggests

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that if the Sphinx
was built then,

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
it should not have been
built in the shape of a lion,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.060 align:middle line:90%
but in the shape of a bull.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:84%
If we wind the skies
back to ancient times,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:84%
we find there's only one period
when the Sphinx would have

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:84%
gazed at its own celestial
counterpart, the constellation

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.215 align:middle line:84%
of Leo, at dawn on
the spring equinox.

00:47:53.215 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.250 align:middle line:90%
That period wasn't 2,500 BC.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:90%
It was 10,500 BC.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:23.630 align:middle line:84%
There is much here that defies
conventional interpretation.

The links to Angkor
are baffling, formed

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:90%
by star last seen in 10,500 BC.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Due north at that moment was
the constellation of Draco,

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in the pattern modeled
by the Angkor temples.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Due east was the constellation
of Leo, twinned by the Sphinx.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:51.405 align:middle line:84%
Due south was the belt of
Orion, mimicked by the Pyramids.

It almost feels as though some
great secret game confronts us,

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:84%
one handed down by
a lost civilization.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I think I've fixed
that civilization

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.790 align:middle line:90%
in time, 10,500 BC.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But I still don't
know what it is

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.919 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to communicate.

00:49:17.919 --> 00:49:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I know there's more to
discover from the depths

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of the sea of Japan, where a
structure that looks man-made

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:84%
also points to that
recurring date of 10,500 BC.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm looking
for a civilization that

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.960 align:middle line:84%
was able to impose its
influence in widely

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.996 align:middle line:90%
separated parts of the world.

00:49:44.996 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:54.190 align:middle line:84%
That means a civilization of
navigators and seafarers, one

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that was determined to preserve
the treasure of its knowledge

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and to pass it
down to the future

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:84%
so that it would
never be forgotten.
