believe all the ancient

half million individual blocks

I think it's part
of a worldwide grid.

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The legacy of a much
earlier civilization

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.414 align:middle line:84%
which has left clues to its
identity all around the world.

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
These cultures have very
similar architecture.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.775 align:middle line:90%
Many built pyramids.

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
They worked with
huge stones, which

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:90%
we can scarcely lift today.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.032 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%

mirrored the stars

incredibly advanced knowledge

Today, with computers,
we can simulate

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the skies of ancient
times and the monuments

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%
built beneath them.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
We can prove that the Giza
site could only have been

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
planned by master astronomers.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
They were modeling star
patterns on the ground.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Pyramid was the
key to their grand design.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.785 align:middle line:90%
It's a riddle in itself, though.

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
A labyrinth of hidden passages
and chambers that were once

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
sealed with massive blocks.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.597 align:middle line:84%
There may be more chambers
yet to be discovered.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Most ancient Egyptian buildings
are covered with inscriptions

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and hieroglyphs.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.386 align:middle line:84%
What's staggering
about the Great Pyramid

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:19.563 align:middle line:84%
is that there are no
inscriptions whatsoever.

00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I've managed to persuade the
Egyptian authorities to allow

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
me to enter the most
remote part of the monument

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to see the next best
thing to an inscription--

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.059 align:middle line:84%
some ancient graffiti that's
believed to be original.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The Victorians blasted their
way in here with dynamite.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And for a period at the
end of the 19th century,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
wealthy visitors were
allowed to deface it.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
This device here is the
cartouche-- the royal name--

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of the pharaoh, Khufu,
who has always been

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
assumed to be the builder
of the Great Pyramid.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's on the
basis of this evidence

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and no other evidence at all
that Egyptologists ascribe

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid to Khufu.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the amazing thing
about this graffiti

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is that in this vast monument,
the greatest stone building

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:90%
ever created on Earth--

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
this is the only place that
the name of Khufu appears.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the pyramid
was built as Khufu's tomb.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, he would have put
his name on it more prominently.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I think he built it for
another purpose altogether.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This austere granite room is
conventionally referred to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
as the King's Chamber.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's assumed that it was
here, that pharaoh Khufu--

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the supposed builder
of the pyramid--

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
was buried, for the very
good reason that there's

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:90%
a sarcophagus in the room.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it was a coffin.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It was used in a
ritual to obtain

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge the pharaoh
needed to become immortal.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
That knowledge was based
on spiritual, astronomical,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and even mathematical teachings.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The room itself is a
mathematical symphony in stone.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.735 align:middle line:84%
It consists of exactly
100 gigantic blocks.

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect two
by one rectangle.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
20 royal cubits in length,
10 royal cubits in width.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Its height is exactly
equivalent to half the corner

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:90%
to corner diagonal of the floor.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions reveal a perfect
3, 4, 5 right angle triangle.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And a knowledge
of geometry that's

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
still credited to the Greek
mathematician, Pythagoras, who

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
lived in the sixth century BC.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.785 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But the builders here clearly
had that knowledge thousands

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
of years before Pythagoras.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They incorporated
it again and again,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:90%
all over the Giza Plateau.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that they
inherited that knowledge, which

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
led to huge advances
in building and mapping

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
from an earlier civilization.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.749 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:90%
But how much earlier?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
The astronomical
alignments give us a clue.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber is
equipped with two shafts,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:90%
both target stars.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The southern shaft
targets the region

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
of the sky through which
the pharaohs believed

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
the would journey after death.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It points directly at the
stars of Orion's belt.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And these stars are
matched by the layout

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids on the ground.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But the date that they match
is the heart of the puzzle.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Using computer simulations,
the Belgian engineer,

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval, has proved that
the perfect match occurred

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:90%
in 10,500 BC.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the
date that the Sphinx

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
matches its celestial
counterpart in the sky--

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:90%
the constellation of Leo.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
In Cambodia, the layout
of the temples of Angkor

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
matches the stars of
the constellation Draco.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And the surprise is that
the same date, 10,500 BC,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:90%
comes up, again.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
One extraordinary date, two
supposedly unrelated sites.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids on the other side
of the world in Mexico

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
contain the same forgotten
knowledge of astronomy.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:90%
There must be a link here, too.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Though, scholars tell
us the ancient Egyptians

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
never crossed the Atlantic.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.742 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Chichen Itza in
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:46.406 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:49.606 align:middle line:84%
The Maya built their pyramids
all over the Yucatan,

00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
between a 1,000 and
1,500 years ago.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So here's another
ancient civilization,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
separated from the Egyptians by
oceans and thousands of years,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
yet producing strikingly
similar designs.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.925 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And with the same
fixation on astronomy.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid is an
astronomical university

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and a permanent calendar
encoded by its builders

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
with the precise mathematics
of sky and ground.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Its summit platform is
approached by four stairways,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
just like this one.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Each stairway has 91 steps.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Multiply 4 by 91
and you get 364.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Add 1 for the summit
platform and you get 365--

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
the number of complete
days in the solar year.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:10%
The principal axis running
through the pyramid

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:10%
from southeast to northwest
targets the rising point

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:10%
of the sun on the
winter solstice

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:10%
and the setting point of the
sun on the summer solstice.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
As gardeners know, the sun
rises in a slightly different

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:90%
position every morning.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of a year,
it travels back and forth

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
along the horizon.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
As it turns, it appears to stand
still and that's the solstice.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Halfway between these
extremes is the equinox,

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
when the sun rises due
east and day and night are

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:90%
of equal length.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid at
Chichen Itza was built

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.237 align:middle line:84%
by people who were
obsessed with tracking

00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:44.195 align:middle line:90%
the sun on the horizon.

00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Their observational
skills were so advanced

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to
position the monument

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
with the pinpoint
accuracy needed

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to create a remarkable
illusion of light and shadow.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.002 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The illusion appears
towards sunset only

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
on two days of the year-- the
Spring and Autumn equinoxes.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.212 align:middle line:84%
The shadow depicts the
coils of a gigantic serpent.

00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid is dedicated to
the snake god, KulKulkan,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
whom the Maya and many
other ancient cultures

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
portrayed as a feathered
or flying serpent.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.958 align:middle line:84%
His entire cult revolved
around astronomy.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
This is the Caracol.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It was the principal observatory
of the priest astronomers

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
of Chichen Itza.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Modern astronomers have worked
hard on the ruined structure

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to figure out exactly
how it was used.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the answer has
slowly become clear.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Diagonal sightlines were
taken through the many doors

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and windows that wind
around the structure.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And through these sightlines,
certain of the stars

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
were viewed as
rising and setting.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
As the sun sets in
the West, we can

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:90%
see how the observatory worked.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
This narrow beam of light is
achieved by an angular view

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
through one of the many
narrow doors and windows

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
that this structure has.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
those openings was

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
designed for the observation
of the sun, and the stars,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and the planets at
particular moments

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.272 align:middle line:90%
during the course of the year.

From their observations
of the heavens,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
the Maya were able to produce
an astronomical calendar

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:90%
of incredible accuracy.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They calculated the
length of the solar year

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
more exactly than we do
in our calendar today.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They used interconnecting
cycles of time.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And their calendar
was so accurate

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that it predicted the solar
eclipse over Mexico City

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:90%
in 1991--

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years after the Mayan
civilization had disappeared.

science of the Maya

and their successors,
the Aztecs,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.422 align:middle line:90%
there lay a mortal fear.

00:14:57.422 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
All the ancient
cultures of Mexico

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
end of the world

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:90%
had been foretold in the skies.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Using the same astronomical and
mathematical knowledge encoded

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramids,
the Mayan calendar

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
predicts that the present
epoch of creation,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
called the fifth sun, will end
in a cataclysm on 4 Ahau, 3

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Kankin.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
In our calendar, that's
the 23rd of December, 2012.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The Maya and the civilizations
that followed them

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
believed they could stop
impending catastrophes

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
through human sacrifice.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Thousands were sacrificed here,
at the Temple of the Warriors

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.179 align:middle line:90%
at Chichen Itza.

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The sacrificial victim
coming up the steps

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
would have seen this
pitiless face awaiting him

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
with the receptacle across its
chest to receive his heart.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
He was then taken
around to an altar

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
on which he was held down
by a high priest with four

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:90%
assistants.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
A flint knife was
plunged into his chest.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
The chest cavity was opened, and
the beating heart was torn out.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to think of a
more material process.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it was
believed as he died

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that the soul of the
victim would rise directly

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to the heavens, bypassing the
terrors of the underworld,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
and would become an
immortal star in the sky.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
One of the names for
human sacrifice was pachi.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:90%
It means to open the mouth.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Curiously enough, far away in
Egypt, a very similar ceremony

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It was also called, the
opening of the mouth.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It didn't involve
human sacrifice.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:10%
It was a ritual conducted
on the body of the deceased.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:10%
But the belief was
that as he died,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:10%
his soul rose directly
into the heavens.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And became an immortal
star in the sky.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm certain that we
need to look to the sky

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve the forgotten
knowledge of our ancestors.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of miles
from Mexico, we're

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:84%
flying to Nazca in southern Peru
to photograph the famous Nazca

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
They're spread out
across hundreds

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of square miles of desert.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Only since the advent of
airplanes in the 20th century,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.582 align:middle line:84%
have we been able to
view the completely.

00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
the people who made

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:90%
could visualize them as a whole.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The writer, Erich von Daniken
suggested extraterrestrials had

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:90%
landed their space ships here--

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.882 align:middle line:84%
an idea that
doesn't work for me.

00:18:57.882 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
There's down to Earth
archaeological evidence

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that processions were
held along the lines

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.115 align:middle line:84%
and around the contours
of the figures.

00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Academics suggest
this was connected

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to a primitive rainmaking cult.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, modern technology
has come to our aid

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and helped formulate
an alternative theory.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The American astronomer,
Dr. Phyllis Pitluga,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
has shown that
many of the figures

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:84%
match star constellations
in the sky.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the most dramatic
drawings at Nazca

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:90%
is the great spider.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It's an exact model of the
constellation of Orion.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Pitluga showed that
sightlines through the figure

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
matched the movement of
Orion over the centuries

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
more than 2,000 years ago.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
The setting stars of
Orion drift slowly

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
across the horizon
for millennia.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.672 align:middle line:84%
The Nazcans were apparently
able to plot their progress.

00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I can't get it out of my mind
that the pyramid builders

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt also represented
the constellation of Orion

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, with their layout
of the pyramids of the Giza

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
There are ruined
pyramids at Nazca.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
They're blown out of
recognition by the wind.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:38.147 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.147 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But they hint at a
lost civilization

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that we know little
or nothing about.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm following the trail
of a lost civilization,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
from Africa to Asia
and to the Americas.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I now want to explore the
oldest civilization in Europe.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We're on our way to Scotland's
Outer Hebrides Islands,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.194 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient
settlement of Callanish.

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a stone circle there,
that's overlooked the Atlantic

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Ocean for more than 5,000 years.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
We know very little
about the culture

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
here, except that they
built with megaliths--

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:90%
literally, big stones.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And that the monuments
they've left us

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
where painstakingly
aligned to the heavens.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We still have no
idea how they could

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
have moved stones of this
size, let alone position them

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:90%
with such accuracy.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
At first sight when
you walk around,

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the shapes of the stones
can seem almost whimsical,

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:90%
almost accidental.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you
look more closely,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
you discover calculation
and precision.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
This protrusion here
and the protrusion

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
on the stone behind me
create a frame, a window.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that window, at dawn on
the longest day of the year,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
the sun rises perfectly
framed with high precision.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The ancient builders could
see how the sun and the moon

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:84%
rose at different points
throughout the year.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
What Callanish
illustrates is that they

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
could measure those changes.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
This stone marks a very
special viewpoint--

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
a secret of the
builders of this place.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.154 align:middle line:84%
Every 19 years, something
magical happens here.

00:23:07.154 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
With virtual reality, we can
see what happens more clearly.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The moon is seen to rise
from that range of hills,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
which the locals still
call the Sleeping Beauty.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And as it comes to set, it
falls directly into the center

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of the circle as though it's
been captured by the circle.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how the
builders of Callanish

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
could study astronomy
with such precision.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
There's one possible
living link with the past--

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:90%
the ancient druids.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Priests who
flourished in Britain

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:84%
before the time of Christ
left us no written records.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.166 align:middle line:84%
So much of their
knowledge is forgotten.

00:24:10.166 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Their modern day
followers still celebrate

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
their religious festivals
at the ancient British sites

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:90%
at midsummer.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
At Dragon Hill near the famous
chalk figure of the Uffington

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:90%
White Horse in Wiltshire.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I've come to establish whether
today's druids have retained

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.744 align:middle line:84%
any of the knowledge passed
down from their ancient

00:24:27.744 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:90%
predecessors.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The druids of ancient
Britain 2,000 years ago

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
suddenly didn't build
the megalithic monuments.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.977 align:middle line:84%
But they perform
ceremonies in them

00:24:48.977 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
to suggest that they

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:90%
knew what they were doing.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And we have one
classical source--

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.746 align:middle line:84%
Julius Caesar-- just
over 2,000 years ago,

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
who tells us something very
interesting about the druids.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:84%
He tells us that they believed
in the immortality of the soul

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and in reincarnation.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And that they studied the stars.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And that all of this was somehow
connected to the stone circles.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.675 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There is kind of a
lineage that goes back,

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very broken lineage.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:10%
What people are doing now--
ourselves included-- is partly,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:10%
we're using the fragments
of recorded druidry.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Working from the classical
writers like Caesar.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Forwards through the medieval,
Welsh, and Irish texts that do

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%
record some Pagan knowledge.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.522 align:middle line:84%
And we're building on that
with what we do ourselves.

00:25:38.522 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Certainly, the people who
built Stonehenge, and Avebury,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:10%
and the other stone circles were
of the same religion that we

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.685 align:middle line:10%
are working now.

00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:51.562 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think today's druids
can provide the hard evidence

00:25:51.562 --> 00:25:52.558 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for.

00:25:52.558 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But the eminent
British professor

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of astronomy, John North, has
made an exciting discovery

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:90%
about our ancestors.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
North claims that the 5,000
year old Uffington White

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Horse is an image on the ground
of the constellation of Taurus,

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:90%
the Bull.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the stars are
moving slowly but constantly

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
over time, we need a computer to
reconstruct the ancient skies.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:84%
First, we need to feed
in our exact coordinates

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
into the global
positioning satellite.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
We're at latitude 51
degrees, 34 minutes north.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And longitude, 1 degree, 34
minutes west of Greenwich.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.446 align:middle line:84%
So let's get that up on sky
globe and see what's happening.

00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
There we are at
June 21, 3200 BC.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.165 align:middle line:84%
We'll get the stars
coming up at rising.

00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.652 align:middle line:90%
And here we are--that's it.

00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
What's extraordinary is
that at precisely the time

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the head of Taurus
appears over the chalk

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
figure, the bright
stars representing

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:84%
the tips of the bull's horns,
rise directly over Dragon Hill.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So here, again,
we're seeing evidence

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of apparently primitive peoples
with a skill or knowledge

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that's become
forgotten by history.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.930 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
More than 5,000
years ago, they were

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
able to measure the
movements of the stars

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and create gigantic figures
on the ground to match them.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
There are extraordinary
similarities between this star

diagram on the chalk
hills of southern Britain

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Nazca figures I've
seen in South America.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Both copy stars on the ground.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.575 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The most famous stone
circle in Britain

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:90%
is undoubtedly Stonehenge.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.375 align:middle line:84%
It was built by the same
culture as Callanish

00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.440 align:middle line:90%
and of White Horse.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Here, too, we find
precisely placed megaliths

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to connect ground to sky.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
But there's more.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge was
thought to have been

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:84%
built 5,000 years ago,
around the same time

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:90%
as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But in 1997, new evidence
confirmed that its origins

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:90%
are indeed much older.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
The unlikely setting
up the car park.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
These concrete manhole
covers behind me,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
mark the site of an
extraordinary archaeological

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:90%
discovery.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The earliest astronomy
at Stonehenge

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
involves the four
station stones.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Two were once aligned with
huge wooden posts, which

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
stood where we now see the
markers in the car park,

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to target the moon's
northernmost setting point.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The latest carbon dating reveals
that these wooden sighting

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
posts were placed in
position 10,000 years ago.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.974 align:middle line:84%
That's 5,000 years
earlier than the orthodox

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:28.456 align:middle line:90%
dating for Stonehenge.

00:29:28.456 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It also ties in closely with
the star pattern dates of Giza.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Can it be a coincidence
that the astronomy

I'm following the trail
of that civilization

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to Carnac in France, where
the coast of Brittany

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
falls away to the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
The face of the Earth changed
between 10,000 and 13,000 years

ago at the end of
the last ice age.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
When the ice melted, the
oceans rose by 300 feet,

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:90%
flooding huge areas.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Here, the worldwide
myth of the flood

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in legends, which
speak of an ancient kingdom

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:90%
drowned beneath the waves.

The megalithic

Only the largest modern
cranes could move it.

50 miles away

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and brought here more
than 5,000 years ago.

Carnac's builders
left no writings

to tell us about their
motives or their technology.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.753 align:middle line:90%
Yet, the stones contain clues.

observations

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%

of Carnac could

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.570 align:middle line:84%
calculate latitude and the
circumference of the Earth.

even close to understanding.

There are at least
three theories

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
concerning these amazing
patterns on the granite walls.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:84%
One theory suggests that
they're fertility symbols.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Another theory says that the
ancient builders were taking

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
hallucinogenic drugs and that
these patterns represented

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.930 align:middle line:90%
their visions.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:10%
And another theory says that
they're a symbolic language,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:10%

information a kind

of astronomical notation.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Really, the only fact we do
have about this passage grave

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is that the passageway
points directly

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:84%
at a significant
astronomical event.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the rising of
the sun on the shortest

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.620 align:middle line:84%
day of the year,
the winter solstice.

that in other cultures

amongst the Incas of Peru--

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
for example-- and amongst
the ancient Egyptians,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
the solstices were
incredibly important

east to west, north to south.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:90%
It was up and down.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I found that there
was some reason why

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:84%
they were marking the
mountains with elevations

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:90%
that fit the system.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.890 align:middle line:84%
When they draw a line,
they're telling you an area.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.612 align:middle line:84%
When they draw an area,
they're telling you a volume.

00:42:44.612 --> 00:42:46.570 align:middle line:84%
When they put volume,
they're telling you time.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What Harleston's saying is
that there are measurements

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:84%
of time in the dimensions
of the building,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:84%
which are connected with
the revolution of the Earth.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the Earth
turns at a fixed speed,

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:84%
we can measure
distance with time.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.650 align:middle line:84%
One is directly
proportional to the other.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%

sophisticated knowledge

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.010 align:middle line:90%
on the builders.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It's high precision astronomy.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:10%
But the thing about this place
is, the space measurements

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:10%
and the time measurements unify.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you know the basic
measure that repeats,

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:90%
you can find it in Egypt.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.280 align:middle line:90%

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:84%

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in boats that moved
without paddles.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.870 align:middle line:84%
What makes me certain
I'm on to something

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.060 align:middle line:84%
is that serpent
symbolism is found

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:90%
all across the ancient world.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:84%
In the temples of
Angkor in Cambodia,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.075 align:middle line:84%
images of gigantic serpents
with many heads are everywhere.

00:48:28.075 --> 00:48:38.785 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And far away in Egypt, in
the Valley of the Kings,

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a representation
of a human soul

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.326 align:middle line:90%
resting on a feathered serpent.

00:48:47.326 --> 00:48:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.640 align:middle line:10%
I think the
similarities are just

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:10%
too great to be passed
off as coincidence,

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:10%
but experts insist there was no
contact between these cultures.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But if there was
no contact, then

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.910 align:middle line:84%
how do we explain the shared
symbolism and beliefs?

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I think the only explanation
is an earlier lost civilization

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that influenced them both,
far back in prehistory.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a civilization
of seafarers, who

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.150 align:middle line:90%
had explored the entire globe.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:10%
The enigmatic and
unexplained statues

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:10%
on Easter Island marooned
in the middle of the Pacific

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:10%
may provide the key.
