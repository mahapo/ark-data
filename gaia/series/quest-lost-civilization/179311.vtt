00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
these things, but I can't help
thinking postholes to put big

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
posts in, such as they
have at Stonehenge.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Some posts.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
massive things.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.012 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's where they
boiled the missionaries.

00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But whether they're
missionary pots or postholes--

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Nature tends not to--

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Not to do that.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.345 align:middle line:90%
Not to do that.

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> This is really--

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't see
it very well on this,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
but this, I think, is
really the most spectacular.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But one thing is, when
you look around, I mean,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
then you get other areas, which
have the same feel and texture,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:90%
but they aren't as spectacular.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> This is like a focal
point of the monument.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It all seems to me to
be part of a pattern.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was clearly
exposed at one point.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:90%
We know that geologically.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.114 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, this
merits further study.

00:11:17.114 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> This one is not natural.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Masaaki Kimura
of Okinawa University is one

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of Japan's leading
marine geologists.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
He's staked his considerable
professional reputation

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
on the assertion that the
Yonaguni Structure is man-make

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and not a freak
natural formation.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So professor, you've been
studying this monument

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:90%
intensively for six years.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Are you really sure
that it's man-made?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So all my research reveals
that this topography never made

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:10%
by natural.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So that means this
topography is man-made.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Kimura and his team of
students have made more than

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
200 dives to survey the
structure at Yonaguni.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It is naturally
eroded, but they say

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
nature could not have produced
the sharp rectangular edges

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and other peculiar features
that the monument displays.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more
interesting as we go along.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's interesting.

00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you are sure
that it's man-made, when?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
When do you think
that man made it?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Based upon the
sea level change,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:84%
the age is older
than 9,000 years.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Somewhere between
9,000 and 10,000 years?

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The last time the sea level
was that low was between maybe

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:90%
9 and 10,000 years.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But in fact, the monument
itself could have been 12 or 13

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.461 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:04.919 align:middle line:90%
>> It's possible.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, that's
very, very interesting,

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.959 align:middle line:84%
because I believe it has
astronomical characteristics.

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It points south, and there's
a major east-west feature

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:90%
running through it.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And 9,900 years
ago, this monument

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
stood precisely on the
ancient tropic of cancer.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Over 10,000 years, the
tilt of the Earth has shifted

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
the position of the
tropics by about 1 degree.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
To determine the
position of the tropics

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
requires a detailed
knowledge of astronomy.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Such knowledge is
only thought to have

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
been developed by the Greeks
in relatively recent times.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Its presence here suggests a
very sophisticated civilization

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:90%
at an impossibly early date.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Before Japan's
underwater monument

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
was flooded 10,000 years ago, it
stood up above water, directly

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.374 align:middle line:90%
on the Tropic of Cancer.

00:14:17.374 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to
think it was part

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
of a network of astronomical
observatories set up

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
by a lost civilization
of ancient mariners.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've found
another link in the chain.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Across the Pacific,
on the tiny island

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of Pohnpei in Micronesia.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:84%
There are more
strange stone temples

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%
at a site called Nan Madol.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The story goes that
two brothers came here

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to establish the temples because
of myths of an underwater city

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:90%
nearby.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
The brothers came from a
mysterious land in the West,

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.512 align:middle line:90%
in a great boat.

00:15:04.512 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.305 align:middle line:84%
They climbed a high mountain
overlooking this point.

00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:15.796 align:middle line:84%
And down in the bay, they saw
a city drowned under the water.

00:15:15.796 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
This told them that they
had found the right place

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.747 align:middle line:90%
to build Nan Madol.

00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
The name translates as
"the place in between."

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The best way to explore
the Nan Madol structures

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
is undoubtedly by boat,
because the whole place

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is arranged like a sort
of Micronesian Venice.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
even at high tide,

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.626 align:middle line:84%
the channels are
just so clogged up

00:15:49.626 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's just not
been possible for us

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to get our flat bottomed
boat through here.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're having to
explore it on foot.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm now standing up to my
shins in warm, sticky mud,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:84%
getting a foot massage
from sea cucumbers.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Disgusting creatures.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've just seen
a sea snake as well.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
If I can get my
feet out of here,

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:15.378 align:middle line:84%
I will try and get into the
main part of the structure.

00:16:15.378 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Archaeologists believe
that this temple is at least

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
a thousand years old, but
very little is known about it.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It's only recently that
experts have considered

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:90%
the astronomical alignments.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:84%
As with Yonaguni and Easter
Island and other sites

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I've studied, it's
perfectly oriented

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
to the points of the compass--

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:90%
north, south, east, and west.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They say the spirit
here is very strong.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:84%
People, they come here
when it's getting dark.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
When the sun go down,
they move out from here.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Rumors from many old people,
they say in those past days,

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.539 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon, there
are people talking here.

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Like ghosts.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they say ghosts.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This strange place also comes
complete with myths of why it

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
was built. They're uncannily
like those I've heard in Egypt

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and Cambodia, which speak of
a place to train or prepare

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the soul for a
journey after death.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Pohnpeians believe
that when a person died,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the soul leaves the
body and goes someplace,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
but the someplace that the
soul goes to is under water.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.606 align:middle line:84%
Souls of people who
probably did not do well

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
will have to go
through certain trials.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
There is a bridge
under water, where

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.665 align:middle line:84%
those people who need
to go through the trials

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
will have to cross the bridge.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
If they could sing
well, or if they did not

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
fall from the bridge, then
they are given the passage

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
to the good world.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.316 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
reef out there.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Local legends speak of
sharks guarding the gates

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
to the sunken city and
of columns under water.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to find
those columns,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately, the
water gets extremely murky.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Where the land begins to
rise up towards the surface,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I can suddenly see it,
a column, very tall.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Although my depth gauge
isn't working properly,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
it's at least five or
six times my own height,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
so we're looking at something
30, perhaps even 40 feet tall.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.026 align:middle line:90%
And then I find another column.

00:19:47.026 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.576 align:middle line:84%
That was a very exciting,
puzzling, strange dive.

00:20:05.576 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to be
certain whether it

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is a natural column of coral,
or whether it's artificial.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I scraped off the
coral in places

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and found a white
stone underneath.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I swam along further
and found two other columns,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:90%
all standing up vertically.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
So the mystery deepens.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's not clear, by any
means, what we have here.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There are other areas around
the coast of Pohnpei where

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
the local people believe
there actually was structures

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.335 align:middle line:90%
underwater.

00:20:43.335 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And this built into
their belief system.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And they consecrated
those as sacred places.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel that it's
possible that it was

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:84%
consecrated as a sacred place
because of an underwater city?

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very highly possible.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And if there are
structures, this

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating, not only for us,
but for the rest of the world.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that I've learnt
since I got here has convinced

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
me that Nan Madol is part
of the jigsaw puzzle,

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
that it is part of this world
wide sky-ground mystery.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In Egypt, the Great Pyramid
of Giza were part of an immense

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
religious system
linked to astronomy.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramids themselves were
a ground map of the stars.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
At Angkor in Cambodia, I
found the same astronomy.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.605 align:middle line:84%
Again, the monuments
map the stars.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:84%
At Easter Island, the obsession
with astronomy surfaces again.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of the statues line up
with the sun and the stars.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Pohnpei, Easter
Island, Angkor, and Giza

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:90%
are linked.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.645 align:middle line:84%
These sites are not
located randomly.

00:22:22.645 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They're the result
of a deliberate plan.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
No one could have done
this without being

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:90%
able to survey the whole world.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
That's something we've
been able to do only

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
in the last few hundred years.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I've come to discuss this idea
with one of the world's experts

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
on ancient measuring.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
John Michell has written a
dozen books on the subject

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and researched it for 40 years.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth was certainly
surveyed in the past.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:10%
They established degrees
of latitude and longitude.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And there is evidence, actually,
that certain places were placed

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:10%
geographically, either
by local considerations

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.875 align:middle line:10%
or by something much bigger.

00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:11.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:23:11.835 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Was it something that
was within their grasp,

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
as far as we
understand the past?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We now know a lot about
ancient astronomy and how

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
proficient many ancient
societies were at it.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, astronomy is
always linked to surveying.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly had the
equipment, essentially the same

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
as we had in the
19th century, when

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.796 align:middle line:84%
we got perfectly
adequate earth surveys

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and measurements of the earth.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.552 align:middle line:84%
Major monuments
are built in units,

00:23:39.552 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
which are part of the
Earth's dimensions,

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
fractions of the
Earth's dimensions.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 18th century,
when Sir Isaac Newton,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
the greatest
scientist of his time,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
wanted to measure the Earth, he
looked to the ancient Egyptians

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:90%
for the answer.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So Newton, not knowing
the dimensions of the Earth,

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
investigated ancient measures
in order to be able to establish

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's dimensions.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.389 align:middle line:84%
That's why he sent John
Graves to measure the Pyramid.

00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And he made a very good
estimate of it, actually.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.554 align:middle line:90%
He got it just about right.

00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:13.367 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.367 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
We seem to have become
rather arrogant in thinking

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
we're the first people
capable of measuring the Earth

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Our ancestors could only
have measured the Earth through

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:90%
the study of astronomy.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's an unexplained
astronomical relationship

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
between Giza in Egypt
and Angkor in Cambodia.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Both cultures appear to
have built their temples

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.555 align:middle line:84%
as a reflection of particular
star constellations,

00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:45.614 align:middle line:84%
as they would have
looked in 10,500 BC.

00:24:45.614 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have done
that without knowledge

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of the very slow movement of the
stars, known as "precession."

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Precession is an almost
undetectable changing

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
of the star field over a very
long periods of time, caused

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
by a slight wobble in
the Earth's rotation.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The stars appear to make
a complete revolution

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.758 align:middle line:90%
every 26,000 years.

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
For the cycle to change by
just one degree takes 72 years.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Encore and Giza are
separated on the globe

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.001 align:middle line:84%
by exactly 72
degrees of longitude.

00:25:24.001 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
In Cambodia, precession is
represented by the number 54,

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:90%
3/4 of a degree of precession.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
All over the site, that number
comes up again and again.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Pohnpei, in the Pacific,
is exactly 54 degrees east

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:90%
of Angkor.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
These sites have
something else in common,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:90%
which links to Easter Island.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
All of them are described
in their local traditions

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
as navels or centers
of the world.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This curious stone may
be a very important part

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Easter Island mystery.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called te pito kura, which
means "the navel of light,"

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:90%
or "the navel of the sun."

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Surat and itself is
called "te pito ote henua,"

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:84%
one of its ancient names, which
means "the navel of the world."

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>> But of course, there's more
to this place than strange

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:10%
names.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:10%


00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:10%
Incredibly, Easter Island
is 144 degrees east

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.290 align:middle line:10%
of Angkor, and 144
degrees west of Giza.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:10%
That's two degrees
of precession.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
A submerged volcanic peak
that was part of the island

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
before the end of the last
ice age fits the grid exactly.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
what we have here

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is a network of
interconnected sites, which

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.677 align:middle line:84%
the ancients could have used
to map and survey the Earth.

00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
If a civilization was destroyed
at the end of the Ice Age,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
its survivors would
certainly have had a motive

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to build their new sites
according to a network,

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:90%
to maintain contact.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But what could have destroyed
such a civilization?

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Scientists believe
that the Earth collided

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
with a comet, which
melted the ice sheets

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.439 align:middle line:90%
and unleashed the flood.

00:27:50.439 --> 00:27:54.111 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The Earth was
never a quiet place.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:10%
Right from the beginning,
it's been a story of impacts.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Impacts between
comets and meteorites

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
essentially led to the
formation of the Earth.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very hard to
deny that the Earth has been

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.475 align:middle line:84%
pounded with comet impacts
right from the very moment

00:28:15.475 --> 00:28:16.275 align:middle line:90%
of its creation.

00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
About 13,000 years
ago, a giant comet

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
became unstable in
its circular orbit

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and was perturbed by
Jupiter into an orbit that

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:90%
crossed the orbit of the Earth.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:84%
A pounding episode
of this kind could

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:84%
have led to the snapping out
of the Earth from the last ice

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.472 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.472 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A big impact from outer space
would have caused tidal waves,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.997 align:middle line:84%
fire, and devastation on
an unparalleled scale.

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Any civilization
is likely to have

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
attributed the
devastation from the sky

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:90%
to the work of the gods.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If they saw things happening
from the skies that affected

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:84%
them so severely
and so dramatically,

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I think they would naturally
come to adopt that kind

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.110 align:middle line:90%
of world view.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it is entirely possible
that a past civilization could

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
have been completely wiped out
with a collision from space,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:84%
just as it is possible that
our present civilization would

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
come to a dramatic end if
a comet were to collide.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's easy to understand how
a great civilization could have

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
been rubbed out, and why ancient
mariners who survived would try

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
so hard to pass on
their knowledge.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.031 align:middle line:84%
It was a legacy of wisdom
and a warning to the future.

00:29:54.031 --> 00:30:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island's ancient name
was "the navel of the world."

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
In the Andes Mountains
of Peru, I'm on my way

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred Inca
city of Cuzco,

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:90%
a name that also means "navel."

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:32.704 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.704 --> 00:30:34.328 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th century,
the Incas believed

00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:38.400 align:middle line:84%
that the earth was repeatedly
destroyed and reborn.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
They feared that the
next cataclysm would

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:84%
be signaled by a
change in the heavens,

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:90%
and carefully studied the stars.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The Incas shared the belief I
found in Egypt and Cambodia,

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
that the souls of the dead
can become stars in the sky.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:08.315 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.315 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:84%
A cathedral built by the
Spanish conquistadors

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500 align:middle line:84%
now largely covers
the great Inca temple

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:84%
at Cuzco, which was
called the Coricancha.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:84%
The Coricancha was the center
of everything for the Incas,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the center of
spirituality and religion.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But above all else, the
center of astronomy.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the most sacred
place in Inca cosmology,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
literally the navel
of the universe.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Inca legends spoke of
this place as sacred

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.970 align:middle line:90%
before the Incas ever came here.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The first Inca found it, the
uncovered navel stone, and this

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
was taken as a sign that
they should build here

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:84%
the Coricancha, their
great temple of the sun.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of it, they
placed this granite coffer,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
covered at one time with
55 kilograms of solid gold.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was said
that, once a year,

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
the sun came down here to drink.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Spanish conquered
the Inca Empire in the 16th

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.150 align:middle line:84%
century, they came here
and stole the gold.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The fabulous wealth of
the Incas was pillaged,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and their extraordinary
knowledge was systematically

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.837 align:middle line:90%
rooted out and destroyed.

00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
On the heights above Cuzco, I
talked to Dr. William Sullivan.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
He's done more than any
other modern scholar

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to point out the sophisticated
astronomy of the Incas.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like the ancient Egyptians,
they worshipped the sun

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and aligned their
monuments to it.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The Inca was
the son of the sun.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:10%
So it was the Sun King
extending his control

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:10%
to all the directions
of the empire

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.015 align:middle line:10%
and his control over the tribes.

00:32:54.015 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:84%
From the Coricancha there
emanated a system of rays

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
called "ceques," to all
points of the compass.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And so far as we know from
the Spanish chronicles,

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:10%
these imaginary lines were lines
of sight from the Coricancha

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:10%
to different places
on the horizon,

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:10%
representing the direction
of all different tribes.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Organized along
these imaginary lines

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
were natural power spots--
springs, fountains, and so on.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Each tribe had to take
care of one of them.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.022 align:middle line:84%
And there was a special day
for each one of these shrines.

00:33:42.022 --> 00:33:43.605 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to sound
like a calendar.

00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The Incas observed the
sky with incredible accuracy

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and saw that the stars were
changing their positions over

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
long periods of time, the
cycle known as precession.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They calculated that
their link to the stars

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and the world of the
ancestors would be cut off

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.842 align:middle line:84%
by the changes in the sky,
a prospect that filled them

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:05.642 align:middle line:90%
with terror.

00:34:05.642 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:84%
All of their efforts
were aimed at preventing

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:90%
such a catastrophe.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they trying
to fix it in some way?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Was that what this
was all about?

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I believe that they
were actually attempting to stop

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.490 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of stopping time
might sound far-fetched,

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
but the Incas believed time
was governed by the stars.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.237 align:middle line:84%
They thought they could
influence the heavens

00:34:39.237 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:90%
by their actions on earth.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.989 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The edict went out from the
Coricancha to each tribe

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to supply a child
to be sacrificed.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:84%
Each child represented
at different star.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.984 align:middle line:84%
After walking across
the mountains to Cuzco,

00:34:58.984 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the children were chained to
a statue symbolizing the sun.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:84%
The brutal sacrifice
was an attempt

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to tie the sun to the
stars, stop their movement,

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.846 align:middle line:90%
and thus stop time.

00:35:11.846 --> 00:35:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The human sacrifice was
very clearly designed to send

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the souls of children
from each tribe,

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that is each
constellation in the sky,

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:84%
back to their homeland in
the sky with a message.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
have the message.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
"May the sun and
moon not grow old."

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Because when any god grows old,
it's the end of a world age.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And "let there be peace."

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, with a huge empire
very stable and at peace,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:84%
except for a few skirmishes
perhaps at the frontiers,

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.460 align:middle line:90%
where was the war?

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:90%
The war was against time.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Incas believed
that if they could stop time,

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:84%
they could stop the
coming cataclysm.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.484 align:middle line:84%
They were not the only culture
to believe in such things.

00:36:08.484 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:84%
From all around the
world, there are

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
myths of cyclical world
ending catastrophes.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And like the myths
surrounding the great flood,

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.531 align:middle line:84%
many are surprisingly
close to fact.

00:36:25.531 --> 00:36:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:10%
>> The more that we investigate
the astronomical myths,

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.645 align:middle line:10%
the more it seems that they
do speak of actual events.

00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:40.321 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Myths from all around
the world frequently

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
talk of a periodic
disturbance of life on Earth

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
by fire, which could be
volcanic eruptions, explosions

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that could occur from
cometary impact and so forth.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing
is that not only

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.560 align:middle line:84%
are they aware that
those events can occur,

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
but they have this kind
of millennial faith

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that our Earth organism,
the earth itself and life

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
on the earth, could
recuperate and recover

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.460 align:middle line:90%
from those catastrophes.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, life on
Earth would begin again

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:90%
in a new cycle of existence.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
so obsessively fascinated

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:84%
with plotting these
long term cycles.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The Incas inherited their
knowledge from a people who

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:84%
were said to have come from
the fabled city of Tiahuanaco,

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
near the shores of Lake
Titicaca in Bolivia.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
to the Inca beliefs,

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
we'd expect to find evidence
of complex astronomy here.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:84%
No one has studied
Tiahuanaco more intensively

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:84%
than those Oswaldo Rivera,
the distinguished Bolivian

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:90%
archaeologist.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
He took me to the famous
Gateway of the Sun,

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to explain its
astronomical significance.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, from this line, we have
the 11 little representations

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:10%
of the sun.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:10%
This is a solar
calendar in stone.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:10%
So this way, they
would observe the range

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:10%
of the sun along the horizon
during the course of the year,

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:10%
and track it symbolically
with these sun figures.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a
little human figure.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:90%
He's a trumpetist.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:84%
He's the announcer of the sun
is going to move to the middle.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So the trumpeter marks
the extreme position

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.122 align:middle line:90%
of the solstice.

00:38:38.122 --> 00:38:38.986 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:38.986 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:90%
From this, we have December.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:43.411 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> January.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> February.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> March.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> April.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> May.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> And June.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just the gateway, but the
whole site is designed to track

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the rising and
setting of the sun.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The controversial
archaeologist, Arthur Posnansky,

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:84%
who lived at Tiahuanaco
for 20 years,

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:84%
worked out how the
temple accurately

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
marks the significant
points of the solar year.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Posnansky deduced that,
in such an accurate site,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the placing of
the corner pillars

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
would have been
designed to target

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the extreme positions of the
sun in its annual movement

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:90%
across the sky.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Because of the changing
tilt of the Earth,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the sun's position now falls
outside the corner posts.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Recent calculations
by Oswaldo Rivera

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.610 align:middle line:84%
show that the sun
would have matched

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:57.430 align:middle line:90%
the pillars in 10,500 BC.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It's astonishing, but
that's exactly the day

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx and the
Pyramids of Giza line

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
up with the stars over Egypt
and the temples of Angkor

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.445 align:middle line:90%
match the stars over Cambodia.

00:40:09.445 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Three sites all linked
astronomically to 10,500 BC?

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.235 align:middle line:90%
That can't be a coincidence.

00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
There's another
link at Tiahuanaco.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Posnansky found ancient
harbor constructions

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:84%
which suggest that
Tiahuanaco was once

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:90%
a port on Lake Titicaca.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Over thousands of
years, the lake

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:84%
has receded and is now 12 miles
away from the city and 300 feet

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:90%
lower.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Geologists I spoke
to confirmed it

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:84%
would have taken between 10
and 13,000 years for the lake

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:90%
to recede that far.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.036 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.036 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%
That puts us back to the time
when the last ice age came

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:90%
cataclysmically to an end.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It changed the
face of the Earth,

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.154 align:middle line:84%
and I believe destroyed a great
civilization of prehistory.

00:41:05.154 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
The ancient mariners who
survived the cataclysm

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.180 align:middle line:90%
spread out around the world.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
There are myths at
Tiahuanaco, which

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
speak of the arrival of a pale
skinned, bearded god credited

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
with bringing civilisation
to South America.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:90%
His name was Viracocha.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing in
front of an image of him

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:90%
here at Tiahuanaco.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the goatee
beard on this figure.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha was said to
have come to the Andes

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in a time of darkness,
after a great cataclysm.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:10%
And he and his companions
traveled northwards,

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:10%
teaching a religion of
compassion and love,

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.785 align:middle line:10%
and teaching also skills such
as astronomy and architecture.

00:41:55.785 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> They were said to have
come from across the sea,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in a boat that moved by
itself without paddles,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.148 align:middle line:84%
and to have established
themselves at Lake Titicaca.

00:42:07.148 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The boat-building skills
of the local Aymara Indians

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.380 align:middle line:90%
have long been acknowledged.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It was here that Thor Heyerdahl,
the Norwegian anthropologist

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and explorer, proved that
larger boats of the same design

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:84%
were capable of
crossing the Pacific.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:38.759 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.759 --> 00:42:40.592 align:middle line:84%
Heyerdahl had such an
ocean-going boat built

00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:90%
for his Kon-Tiki expedition.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.050 align:middle line:84%
He sailed it from Peru,
across the Pacific,

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.500 align:middle line:90%
and past Easter Island.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
The boats are made
from totora reeds.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Almost identical boats
were made in ancient Egypt,

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.644 align:middle line:90%
using papyrus reeds.

00:42:58.644 --> 00:43:02.937 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.937 --> 00:43:05.790 align:middle line:84%
What both of these styles
of boat have in common

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they are based on an
ocean-going design with a very

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.050 align:middle line:90%
high prow and curving stern.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:90%


00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.250 align:middle line:84%
This ancient tradition, which
has been passed from father

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to son, down the generations
for thousands of years,

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.920 align:middle line:90%
is coming to an end.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it'll just become
another part of mankind's

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:90%
forgotten knowledge.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
As forgotten as the
boat-building skills

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt,
which I believe

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:84%
must have been inherited
from the same source.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:90%
The design is identical.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:44:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Sophisticated boats, 70
feet long with an ocean

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:84%
going design, have
been excavated in Egypt

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:30.804 align:middle line:84%
from tombs more than
5,000 years old.

00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This relief from 1,500 BC
documents an amazing expedition

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptians
made down the Red Sea

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and into the Indian Ocean,
probably to the coast

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of Somalia, to bring
back frankincense trees,

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.565 align:middle line:90%
beloved of the gods.

00:44:48.565 --> 00:44:51.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.670 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the
precise astronomy reflected

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Egyptian
architecture,

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:10%
isn't it obvious that the
lost prehistory of this people

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:10%
includes millennia of
navigational experience?

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the survivors
of the lost civilization

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm searching for settled in
Egypt thousands of years before

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:90%
the pharaohs.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Their knowledge
and their memories

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of the world before the
flood were passed down

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.230 align:middle line:84%
from one generation to
another, until hieroglyphs

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:90%
could set them in stone.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the temple of
Edfu in Upper Egypt.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:48.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Carved on its walls are
acres of hieroglyphic texts,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:84%
which speak of a time
when the gods lived

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:84%
on an island, surrounded
by a vast ocean.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
A terrible flood destroyed the
island and drowned almost all

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.711 align:middle line:90%
of its divine inhabitants.

00:46:09.711 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There were only
a few survivors,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.700 align:middle line:84%
amongst them seven sages, also
called the seven builder gods,

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.120 align:middle line:90%
who chose to settle in Egypt.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.340 align:middle line:84%
They traveled around
this land, building

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.130 align:middle line:84%
sacred mounds, which were
to be the foundations

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.160 align:middle line:90%
of all future temples.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Their objective was nothing
less than to recreate

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:90%
the former world of the gods.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:44.874 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.874 --> 00:46:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What the myths are telling
us couldn't be clearer,

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and fits perfectly with
everything we now know about

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
the cataclysmic history of the
Earth during the past 13,000

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.260 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Out of the waters
of the global flood

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
last ice age, I

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.850 align:middle line:84%
believe that a few survivors
of an advanced civilization

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:84%
did make their way
to Egypt and did

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.767 align:middle line:84%
attempt to establish
it as a cosmic land,

00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:11.225 align:middle line:84%
mirroring the
patterns of the stars

00:47:11.225 --> 00:47:17.790 align:middle line:84%
as they last appeared
in 10,500 BC.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Water erosion patterns around
the Great Sphinx of Giza

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:84%
provide strong
geological evidence

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that this monument
at least may actually

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.386 align:middle line:90%
have been built in that epoch.

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:32.316 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Its face is an
emblem of mystery,

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.240 align:middle line:84%
As are the great
stone heads of Angkor

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.190 align:middle line:84%
lying in the jungles of Cambodia
72 degrees to the east of Giza.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What is the real history
of the underwater monument

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.980 align:middle line:90%
at Yonaguni in Japan?

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:10%
And the great statures
Easter Island, surely not

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.436 align:middle line:10%
accidentally left lying exactly
midway between Giza and Angkor.

00:48:07.436 --> 00:48:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Human knowledge is fragile.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the treasures of wisdom
are easily destroyed,

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.625 align:middle line:84%
as the experience of
Easter Island proves.

00:48:23.625 --> 00:48:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.860 align:middle line:84%
There may be many explanations
for the similarities

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and connections that we found
interlinking all these places,

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.250 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that
the best explanation

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:84%
is a lost civilization, lost
in the night of time that

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.710 align:middle line:90%
once touched them all.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it's possible that that
civilization knew something

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that we do not, and
that its survivors,

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.400 align:middle line:84%
after the great cataclysm
that brought the last ice

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.520 align:middle line:84%
age to an end, went to
extraordinary lengths

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.945 align:middle line:90%
to keep that knowledge alive.

00:48:54.945 --> 00:48:57.900 align:middle line:90%


00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It was fundamentally
a spiritual teaching

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that concerned the
mission of humanity

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.100 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, not
to lose ourselves

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in the illusion of
material things, material

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
greed, material ambition,
but to understand

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that material life is a precious
opportunity for each individual

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to learn and to grow
and to develop, to equip

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:90%
the soul for immortality.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.260 align:middle line:84%
The teaching still
exists, locked away

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in the myths and the
monuments and the astronomy.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.590 align:middle line:90%
And it can be retrieved.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Poised at the edge
of a millennium,

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
after a century of unparalleled
wickedness and bloodshed,

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we need the ancient
wisdom more than ever before.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:54.340 align:middle line:90%
