00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In the case of mercury, there
is no safe dose of mercury.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting concept.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Some poisons in
this world, you can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980 align:middle line:84%
get to lower and lower
levels, and finally you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
reach a point where there just
simply isn't enough around

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
to cause disease.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the context
of mercury, the problem

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:90%
is the element mercury is toxic.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:84%
So inherently, if you have a
single molecule of mercury,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
it's toxic to human, to
a cell, whatever it is.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.247 align:middle line:84%
The only question is, how
much damage does it do?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, how
much damage do you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
need to clinically manifest with
something that we call disease?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course where
does that occur,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the brain, the
kidney, the heart, whichever

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:90%
organ.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So the element of dose,
when it comes to mercury,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
is only a function of how much
clinical symptoms you have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
or how many people
are damaged by it.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very different
kind of poison.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, in
the context of mercury,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that we understand
how susceptibility

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
works, why some of us are
more susceptible than others.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The main susceptibility
is related to ability

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to excrete mercury, which goes
back to the element itself

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:90%
being poisonous.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, that if you put
mercury in a human body,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
the body can't break it down.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of element.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the most elemental state.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So the body can't chew
it up, can't modify it,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:90%
deactivate it, or something.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
All it can do is
eliminate it, excrete it.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the body makes a
substance called glutathione.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Glutathione is a very
sulfur-rich compound.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Mercury likes to
bind onto sulfur.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And this glutathione
that's inside of our cells,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
in our blood, when we have
mercury exposure, whether it's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
from amalgams or injected
in a vaccine or we eat fish,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
the glutathione
goes and scavenges--

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
means binds up-- the
mercury and excretes it out

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
through the feces,
out through the urine,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
even to a certain
degree through hair.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is that there is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
tremendous variability on
the amount of glutathione

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
among individuals.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Just in the context of autism,
the children who have autism

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
have over 50% less
glutathione than normal kids.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't a
case where they have

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
a metabolic or an inborn
error of metabolism--

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
they have no defense.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:90%
They just have less.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when mercury is
put into their system,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
it causes more
damage, or they're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
more susceptible to
being damaged by it.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
