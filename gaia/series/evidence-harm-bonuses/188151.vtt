[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Mercury is one of the most
toxic elements and a persistent

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.230 align:middle line:84%
traveler through
our environment.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So who's the travel agent
for this elemental poison?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Coal-fired power plants?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.658 align:middle line:90%
Most definitely.

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Mining operations-- of course.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Your neighborhood dental office?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Surprisingly yes.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations
Environment program

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
reports that 10% of
global mercury usage

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:90%
is for amalgam tooth fillings.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
This results in up to 340
tons of dental mercury

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
journeying into the
environment each year.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
In the United States, dentists
are currently the largest users

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:90%
of elemental mercury.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
This accounts for roughly 32
tons of mercury used yearly

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to place amalgam
restorations, otherwise known

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:90%
as silver fillings.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Although the number
of amalgams placed

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
has decreased over
the last few decades,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
dentists still use amalgam
without precautions.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So the threat of mercury
exposure continues.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Dental mercury travels many
pathways on its journey

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:90%
back into the environment.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It starts when a
dentist receives

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:90%
pre-capsulated dental amalgam.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
In each capsule, up to 900
milligrams of elemental mercury

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is separated from
the other alloys.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
To make the final
product, the capsule

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
is vigorously shaken
in a tricherator

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to thoroughly mix
all the elements.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Occupational safety
concerns arise

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
because this heats the
mercury, creating thousands

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
of micrograms of mercury
vapor, which are released

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:90%
upon opening the capsule.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The used amalgam capsule
still contains a small amount

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:90%
of mercury.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So the ADA recommends
the capsules

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
be stored in an
airtight container

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and collected by a
hazardous waste company.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
majority of dentists

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
toss the capsules
into the trash.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
This mercury contaminated
trash will eventually

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
travel to a landfill, where
the mercury will continue

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:90%
its trek down into the soil.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Back at the dental office,
the freshly mixed amalgam

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:90%
is placed into the tooth.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The dentist then carves
away any excess material.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
While patients swallow
some amalgam waste,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
most is suctioned out and flows
through a filtration system.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But this system only
captures a small percent

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:90%
of the larger pieces.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of
much smaller pieces

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
escape into the wastewater.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
A similar scenario
plays out when dentists

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%
replace amalgam fillings.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Many dentists clean out
their filtration systems

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:84%
by dumping the captured mercury
tainted sludge down the drain.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
A study funded by
the ADA estimated

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that amalgam fillings
contribute up

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
to 50% of the mercury
found in wastewater.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
This contaminated water then
flows to publicly-owned water

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:90%
treatment plants.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
While efforts are made to remove
the mercury from wastewater,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
most of it settles down
into the sewage sludge,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
which is then taken and
spread on land as fertilizer

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:90%
or deposited in a landfill.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
In both scenarios,
the mercury constantly

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
off-gases into the atmosphere
and seeps into the ground.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
A percentage of
the sewage sludge

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is also sent packing
to incinerators.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
With over 200 tons
of dental mercury

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
in the mouths of
Americans, even exhaling

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
is a contributor of
mercury to our atmosphere.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, people
with amalgam fillings

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:84%
serve as hosts for
Mercury's passage back

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
into our environment through
the excretion of human waste.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Mercury's ride continues
even after death.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Crematoriums, which are
unregulated and contain

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
no filtering processes,
are a growing vehicle

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
for transporting mercury
back into the atmosphere.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
When all the various
pathways are accounted for,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
dental mercury from the United
States contributes roughly 28

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and a half tons into the
environment each year.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
The governments of the world
are actively working together

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the amount of
mercury released globally

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to protect human health.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
The first and foremost step to
eliminating mercury released

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
from dental amalgam
is to discontinue

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:90%
the use of this toxic material.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
With the threat so great
and the solution so simple,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
it's time to restrict
mercury's passport.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:90%
