00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand,
as human beings,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we all want to know causation,
what causes something else

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty is in
assigning causation

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
with many of our exposures
in our modern world.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
The historical way
in which it was done

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
involves something
called Koch's postulates.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Koch lived in the
late 1800s, and he

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
developed a series of
postulates to explain causation.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
These were done in the
context of infectious disease.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:84%
What he said is that if you
took a person, let's say,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that had some kind
of an infection--

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
he was primarily looking
at bacterial infections--

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and you were able to isolate
bacteria from them and take

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
those bacteria, grow them up
outside of the person in some

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
kind of flask, or in
a vial or something,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and take those and inject
them into a another species--

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
an animal, usually
rabbits, mice, but it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
could be any animal--

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and you could cause
the same disease

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in that
person in the animal, that

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:90%
was proof of causation.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:84%
That was sort of like
100% kind of causation.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a very
mathematical kind of formula.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that when we
talk about dental amalgams

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of other
exposures, lots of people

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:90%
are exposed to these things.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Only some of us develop disease.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So instead, there's obviously
a much broader explanation

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:90%
that's necessary.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where, in the
world of epidemiology,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
these criteria have
been developed.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They're called
Bradford Hill criteria.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
He was a very famous
epidemiologist

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
in the mid 1900s
who said, obviously,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:90%
we have lots of exposures.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Only some people have disease.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:90%
We have to make a inference--

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to direct,
an inference--

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
as to causation.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And he developed a whole series
of criteria of various things

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
you might need in order
to prove causation.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't need all of them.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Some of them suffice.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gray line
when you cross that line.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why people
might disagree.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.802 align:middle line:90%
I might say causes.

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Somebody next to me would say,
well, maybe not quite enough

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:90%
to prove causation yet.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And what he described are
some very simple things

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the most basic
is the relationship

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:90%
of cause and effect.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
If you have an exposure, it
needs to precede the outcome.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
If you have somebody, let's
say, that has Alzheimer's and it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
turns out, well,
the mercury exposure

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.818 align:middle line:84%
occurred after they had
Alzheimer's, it can't cause.

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all understand that.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So mercury exposure
would have to happen,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
then you get the
diagnosis to allow what's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:90%
called a temporal relationship.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Another element of it
that's very important

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:90%
is animal studies.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens in an animal
if you inject mercury?

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Does it persist?

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
What kind of damage
does it cause?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Does it look like what the
person is suffering from?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he describes
the plausibility of it.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it scientifically plausible?

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.408 align:middle line:84%
Are we saying that, in
the case of mercury, well,

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
is it damaging the brain?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a very plausible thing.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
If we say that something that
doesn't even go to the brain

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is damaging the brain,
that's very implausible, not

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%
impossible, but implausible.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So plausibility
provides an element.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he
described epidemiology,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
observing large
numbers of people.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Do people who have the
exposure tend to have

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
more risk of the outcome?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:90%
So that can be important.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Also, understanding the
elements of susceptibility.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
What makes one person
affected and not another?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
more like this.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
