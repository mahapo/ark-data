00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike Ziff got to examining
the relationship between

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
mercury and infertility and
the scientific literature.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:84%
He dug out all of
the studies that

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
have been done over half
a century of showing

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that mercury causes
failed ovulation,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
hypermenorrhea, hypomenorrhea.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:90%
The eggs don't drop.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:90%
They're infertile.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:90%
The sperm are damaged.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
They got two-headed
sperm, two-tailed sperm.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.762 align:middle line:84%
A whole bunch of
bad stuff happens

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:90%
if you're exposed to mercury.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.428 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote a
whole book on it.

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gerhard would--
has a big seminar

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
room that had 450 women
would come annually.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And when she read
Mike Ziff's book,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
"Infertility and
Birth Defects," she

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
said, well, if mercury
is causing infertility,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I can check that.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So when all the
ladies showed up they

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
handed them a couple
of tablets of DMPS

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and a glass of water in a jug.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And they said, take
this and pee in there,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and hand that in in six hours.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So all the ladies that
peed a lot of mercury

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.935 align:middle line:84%
after they were given a
chelating agent for mercury,

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
were sent on down to
the dental clinic.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And they had all their
amalgams removed carefully.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And within the following
12-month cycle,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.777 align:middle line:84%
they had 80% spontaneous
fertility with no intervention.

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they put
them on birth control pills

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
for six months,
because they noted

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
that the blood level
of mercury continues

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to drop for at least six months
after all your amalgams are

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:90%
removed.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted the blood
level to be really low, so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:90%
that the fetus is not exposed.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, 80% of
them became spontaneously

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
pregnant without any
other intervention.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
That makes it the single
most effective way

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:90%
to make infertile women fertile.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
After I read Mike Ziff's book
about infertility and birth

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
defects, about
1990, a young lady

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
applied for the job of my
front office receptionist

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:90%
and manager.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And my wife Betty and
Cammie were just sitting,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%
chatting on the couch.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And they got to talking
about how many staff members

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd had over the years, because
they move away because they

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
were a wife of a Navy guy,
or they get pregnant and have

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
babies and all that stuff.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And Cammie said, well, I
won't be getting pregnant,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:90%
because I'm infertile.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we've spent
over $10,000 trying to get me

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:90%
pregnant and I can't.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So Eddie and I will
just be childless.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I had my
mercury sniffer,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I measured the amount of
mercury in her intraoral air,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and it was over 100
parts per million.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
OSHA will shut down
a factory, and you're

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
supposed to flee if it gets
over 100 parts per million,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:90%
even instantaneously.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was over that
every time she chewed.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the few
benefits of working

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
for me was none of my staff
had any mercury fillings

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
in their teeth.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if they wanted to get
rid of them, I got rid of them.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So we got rid of her
mercury fillings.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I told her to,
like the Gerhard thing,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
to go on birth control pills.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you didn't want the
kid to get pregnant while

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:90%
she was still detoxing.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And nobody ever listens to me.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:90%
But OK.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
So she got pregnant had twins.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, oh,
that's just a fluke.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so she-- after the
twins got old enough,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
she came back to work
for me some more.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.687 align:middle line:84%
And then, she had
to go away again

00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and have little MacKenzie.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Another assistant that I had,
her husband divorced her.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
He said he wouldn't be
married to a barren woman.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, one
of the few benefits

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of being in my practice is
you don't have any mercury

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
fillings in your teeth.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.263 align:middle line:84%
So we took all the
mercury out of her teeth,

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and she had to marry
her second husband.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:90%
They have three children now.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it's quite
a pleasure for her.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But she's no longer
a barren woman.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:84%
A third lady, I think
she read something

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:90%
about mercury and infertility.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And she wasn't even
from San Diego.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.357 align:middle line:84%
She drove down and
wanted to know if I'd

00:03:54.357 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:90%
take mercury fillings out.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And we arranged to have
her fillings removed,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and did it carefully.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
You have to protect them.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.277 align:middle line:84%
You can't expose them to mercury
when you take the fillings out.

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And she came back with
a baby on her shoulder

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and a picture of the
kid and said, hey, look.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I have six children.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.227 align:middle line:84%
None by me, but because I
helped three infertile ladies

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
have them by getting rid
of the predominant source

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.518 align:middle line:90%
of human exposure to mercury.

00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
