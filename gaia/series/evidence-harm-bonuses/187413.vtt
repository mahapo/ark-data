00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I was on the United study
sections for many, many years.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was funded the very first
year I was a college professor.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I was an assistant professor
and on study sections

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that first year, because I had
invented a technology called

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:84%
photo-friendly labeling
that was widely

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
touted as being a very good
technique in biochemistry

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
for looking at certain
enzyme structure

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and function, et cetera.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, I was funded probably

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
straight for 25,
26 years at least

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
on the same kind of project,
and sometimes double funded.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
At one time, I had
a program to make

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
these compounds that were very
useful in diagnosis, et cetera.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had one, too,
that was concentrating

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
on Alzheimer's disease, because
our preliminary data had shown

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that we could detect major
biochemical differences

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
between a normal brain tissue,
the enzymes that were active,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and Alzheimer's disease
with certain enzymes

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that were almost 80%
to 99% inhibited.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And this gives you
a key as to what's

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
going wrong in the
Alzheimer's diseased brain.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And I got a five-year program
project grant to study that.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.515 align:middle line:90%
And at that time, what I knew--

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
reading up on
Alzheimer's disease--

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not
genetically inherited.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can have two parents
with Alzheimer's disease,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
have children that never get it.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And a study from 500 sets of
identical twins from World War

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
II showed that one identical
twin could get Alzheimer's, and

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
the other one would not.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is a genetic
susceptibility.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a strong
correlation with between twins,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.842 align:middle line:90%
but it's not absolute.

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And that tells you there's
got to be a susceptibility

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.422 align:middle line:90%
to an external toxin.

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, people
were looking for that.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
it was aluminum.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Some reports had come out
saying it was aluminum.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Marksberry, at the
University of Kentucky,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
had found elevated
mercury in the brains

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of Alzheimer's patients
versus age-matched normals.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought
looking at heavy metals

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
would be the way to go.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
So I did a set of
studies testing what

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.678 align:middle line:90%
heavy metals would do this.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And mercury was one
of them I put in.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
I had no concern

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:90%
about amalgam fillings--

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
anything regarding
mercury toxicity.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But the phenomenal
data that came out

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
was that mercury,
and only mercury,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
would cause the same
biochemical abnormalities

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
as you saw in
Alzheimer's disease

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
using our technology
for evaluating

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
the activity of certain enzymes.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It showed that the tubulin
was totally dysfunctional.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Mercury knocks that
out very quickly,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:90%
not only in control homogeneous.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we expose rats
to mercury vapor,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
their tubulin, after
a period of time,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
just dissipated like
you'd see in an AD brain.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And creatine kinase-- which
is an enzyme that's 99%

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
inhibited in the
AD brain relative

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.073 align:middle line:90%
to age-matched controls.

00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
being a biochemist,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I know that enzyme quite well.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who
isolated and identified

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:90%
its nucleotide binding site.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And it had a sulfur in it,
a very reactive sulfur.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And other people
before me had shown

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that sulfur was critical to
the activity of the enzyme.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, sulfur
is what mercury

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:90%
is most highly attracted to.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And the third one was
glutamine synthetase.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's known that glutamate
levels are elevated

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%
in Alzheimer's disease brain.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
enzyme that removes

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
glutamate from the
synapse in a brain

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.302 align:middle line:90%
after a neural transmission.

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So we had three key
enzymes, and everyone

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:90%
thought that was great.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever said I was wrong.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
they say I'm right.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt about the fact
that the observation's right.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into
trouble was when I said,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:90%
mercury caused this.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And I got my next grant back.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had that data in
there, and a progress

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
report, et cetera,
and as something I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
wanted to study further.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.602 align:middle line:90%
How could you reverse it?

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:90%
How could you address it?

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
What was the effect of,
say, things like lead,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and aluminum,
cointoxicants on how much

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
mercury would require toxicity?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew that lead plus
mercury is not a-- toxicities

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
are not additive.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
They're synergistic.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one plus one
will equal 10, 20, 100.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I got the review
back, the scientist part of it

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:90%
was fine.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.225 align:middle line:84%
They knew I could
do the studies.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
They knew I had the tissues.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, there
was this kind of thing.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And it said something
to the effect,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Haley has to
realize we don't

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
need to see any more of
these kinds of studies.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And my grant-- there was
some other comments in here

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:90%
that were ridiculous.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I challenged that grant.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
The NIH has a very fair system
that, if you don't like,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and you think people were
incorrect in making value

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.327 align:middle line:84%
judgments about what you
have said you're going to do,

00:04:43.327 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
that you can challenge it.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:90%
So I challenged it.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.963 align:middle line:84%
It was sent to
another study section.

00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And the other study section
said, Dr. Haley's right.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:90%
These critiques-- some of them--

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:90%
are ridiculously wrong.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I got my grant.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But the next time my grant
went in, it was triaged.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's just,
this may be fine research,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
but we just don't
want to do it anymore.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And so since that time, I have
never gotten another NIH grant.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.067 align:middle line:84%
And it coincided with the report
that mercury causes amalgams.

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
people who don't like that.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would point out
to anyone listening,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I've never been invited to
an Alzheimer's conference

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:90%
to present my data.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very dramatic.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is dramatic.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
No one else has identified
anything exposed

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
to humans that would
cause the production

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
of a major diagnostic
hallmark and three

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
of the major biochemical
abnormalities

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
you find in Alzheimer's disease,
because the people in Calgary,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Canada did studies on
neurons in a culture

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and showed exactly what I
showed-- that mercury, and only

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
mercury, causes the breakdown
and the depolymerization

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
of tubulin off the
neurofibril, producing

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
neurofibrillary tangles, which
is the hallmark of Alzheimer's

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.283 align:middle line:84%
Those were the same people
who did that that did the rat

00:05:55.283 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
studies with me where we tested
the brains after they exposed

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
the rats to mercury vapor
showing that, again, they

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:90%
had an AD-like brain.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's somewhat
disconcerting that you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
think that political people
have some control over NIH.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.007 align:middle line:84%
And if they like what
you're producing, fine.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But if it's politically
uncomfortable,

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:90%
it's just not going to happen.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
