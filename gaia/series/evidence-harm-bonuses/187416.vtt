00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I researched all the
literature on the occupational

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.730 align:middle line:84%
exposure of dentists to amalgam,
and ended up writing a paper

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
as a result of that research--
that was published--

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
on exposure, predominantly,
to particulate matter.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
As dentists drill out a
filling, their dental drill

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:90%
runs at about 400,000 RPM.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And it sends a shower of
micron-size and sub-micron-size

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:90%
particles everywhere.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's tens of thousands
of parts per million.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
There was literature,
actually, that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
measured the amount of
particulate matter in the air

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
space or the breathing zone
of a dentist during removals.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And a researcher had studied
this using mannequins

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
into which they had put in fake
teeth with fillings in them,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and then drilled them out and
taken all the measurements

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:90%
while they were doing it.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And the dose of particulate
matter experienced by dentists

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
if they don't take
precautions is huge.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's way larger than
the vapor exposure

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
they get during
the same process.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Particulate exposure
for a single filling

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
delivers micrograms of
mercury, which in mercury terms

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:90%
is a lot.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And this happens--
you know, at the time,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
the average was around four
to five fillings were removed

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
by a typical dentist
in any given day,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
so that he could replace
them or whatever.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And if they-- even if they
wear the typical surgical mask,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
they're designed to stop
particles of around three

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
microns in size or
larger, because that's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
the size of typical bacteria.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the particles of amalgam
pass right through that mask,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're well
less than three microns.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They average around one
and 1/2 microns in size,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and go down to the
sub-micron level.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The amalgam load would
probably give them

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
100 times more
exposure to mercury

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.183 align:middle line:84%
than just inhaling
the vapor that

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
is present at the same time.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The particle load
carries an un-- well,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.058 align:middle line:84%
50% of the mass of any
particular particle is mercury.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's delivered
straight to the lungs,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's absorbed
within three days.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And the mass is quite large.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And it stays there--

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the mercury
vapor, drops off fairly quickly.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Amalgam particles that
have been inhaled,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
they don't dissipate anywhere
but directly into the body.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So the dose delivered is
very, very significant.
