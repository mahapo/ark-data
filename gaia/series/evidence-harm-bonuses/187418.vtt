00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm Dan Laks.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a Masters of Science
in environmental health

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.570 align:middle line:90%
science from UC Berkeley.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I decided to look
at what would be

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.060 align:middle line:84%
the effects of chronic
mercury exposure

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:90%
on the human population.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.260 align:middle line:84%
What this study found was
that chronic mercury exposure

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
was rising over the
years, 1999 to 2006,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:90%
within the US population.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And this rise went from 3% of
the US population to almost 30%

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of the US population
having detectable amounts

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
of inorganic mercury
in their blood.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now inorganic mercury
is a specific form

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
of mercury either made
from organic mercury, which

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
gets de-methylated
to it, or it's also

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
made from elemental
mercury such as you

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
get from dental amalgams,
which gets catalyzed to it.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And these deposits
of inorganic mercury

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
actually get deposited in
different tissues of the body

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and stay there for years.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So not only was
there an increase

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:84%
in this chronic
mercury exposure,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
but this chronic
mercury exposure

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
was at a level that was
sufficient to elicit

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
a biological response in the
deliver, the immune system,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and the pituitary.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at
those three areas,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at biomarkers
that indicated function

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:90%
for those three areas.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And all three areas
were associated

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
with this chronic
mercury exposure.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
So the immune system--

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the biomarker I chose of white
blood cell count and that

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
was inversely related to
chronic mercury exposure.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have chronic
mercury exposure,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
immune function problems,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and this has already
been shown in vitro

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and in other
toxicological studies.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, the same
was true with bilirubin

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and albumin, which both
biomarkers of the liver

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
function and associated
with lots of diseases

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and most strikingly and most
novel finding of this study

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
was the association with
luteinizing hormone, which

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:90%
is secreted by the pituitary.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And now why this is important
is because luteinizing hormone--

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and this was my
second paper that I

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
published on the subject--

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
was that luteinizing hormone
provides a causal mechanism

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%
for mercury associated disease.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Luteinizing hormone
is in a place

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
where mercury is deposited in
the body at a much higher rate

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
than other regions of the
brain at 200% to 300% higher.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It basically
provides a mechanism

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
for all of the
associated symptoms

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and morbidity associated
with mercury exposure

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and associated diseases.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Our chronic mercury
exposures have

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:84%
reached a level that is having
a significant biological effect.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only that
but it is having

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
a increased and elevated
risk for our population

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and for individuals over time.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems obvious to
researchers in the field

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's a growing health risk
that needs to be addressed.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it's a political
issue that is being stymied.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So without a change in
the political environment,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
science and human health
is really at risk.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
