00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Mark Richardson,
PhD in biology.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.950 align:middle line:84%
My company is Risk
Logic Scientific,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
though I work for Health
Canada, amongst other companies

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and departments.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I guess my claim
to fame, really,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
is risk assessment on mercury
exposure from dental amalgam

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that I did for the Health
Canada in 1994, 1995.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And then that sort of led to
a number of studies looking

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
at the evaluation of the
risks posed by comps or resins

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
as a possible alternative
to dental amalgam that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
has spun off into
looking at gold

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and ceramic dental
materials and then

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring risk assessment,
I guess, to the discussion

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
table, not just
exposure, not just

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
efficacy as a dental
material, but looking at risks

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
for potential health effects
in the general population who

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
might dental amalgam
fillings, that sort of thing.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I do.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You asked about the whole
issue of how much mercury

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.768 align:middle line:84%
do you get from a
tuna fish sandwich,

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
if you eat a tuna fish sandwich
versus how much you would get

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:90%
from dental amalgam fillings.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And you had asked me to take
a look at that question.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
track down information

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
on the internet from, I
believe, a physician who

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
made the claim that, oh, you
get far more mercury from a tuna

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
fish sandwich than you do
from dental amalgam fillings.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was kind
of a blanket statement.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
There was no definition
by this person

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
as to, well, how many
tuna fish sandwiches was

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:90%
he talking about?

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to know
how many sandwiches you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
eat, how much tuna is
actually in each sandwich,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
how much mercury is in the
tuna that's in the sandwich.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to compare
that to amalgam fillings.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many
fillings, and et cetera?

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So the blanket statement
really isn't defensible.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no way to
quantify or determine

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
how this person, this physician
had reached their conclusions.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:90%
So I redid all the calculations.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, if you
have no amalgam fillings

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.333 align:middle line:84%
and you eat one tuna
fish sandwich a day,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
you know what, you're going
to have more mercury from tuna

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
than you are from
dental amalgam?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if you
have one amalgam filling,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
but you never eat
tuna, you're going

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.923 align:middle line:84%
to get more mercury from
your amalgam fillings

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
than you are from tuna fish.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:90%
That just kind of makes sense.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the balance of
the scheme of things

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the average rate of
tuna fish consumption by the US

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
population compared
to the average number

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
of amalgam fillings held by
members of the US population,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
you actually get way
more exposure to mercury

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
from amalgam than you
do from tuna fish.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The second aspect of
that whole comparison

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
isn't just the levels of
exposure, but the risks.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
How does the amount of methyl
mercury you get from tuna fish

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
compare to the amount
of methyl mercury

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
that's safe to be taken in?

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And the US Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
they define Safe Dose as a
reference dose or reference

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:90%
concentration.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.023 align:middle line:84%
In this case, for methyl
mercury, it's a reference dose.

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the amount that a
person in the population

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
can be exposed to every
day without concern

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
about health effects.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So how does the exposure from
eating a tuna fish sandwich

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:90%
compare to that safe dose?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can do exactly the
same thing for dental amalgam?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what I've
been doing since '94, '95.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at the
exposure and how

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
it compares to the safe exposure
level for the mercury vapor

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that emanates from
dental amalgam fillings.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And the toxicity, if you
look at those safe doses,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the safe exposure levels
as a general definition

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of the toxicity of a
substance, the safe level

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of exposure for mercury
vapor is much lower

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:90%
than it is for methyl mercury.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't define for you
off the top of my head

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
right now what those
levels are, probably

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
around 0.2 micrograms
per kilogram body weight,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I believe, for methyl mercury.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
level of exposure associated

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
with the US EPA's
reference exposure level,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:90%
it's about 10 times lower.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So that would imply,
in a general sense,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that mercury vapor is about 10
times more toxic or potentially

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.502 align:middle line:84%
toxic than is methyl
mercury, at least based

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
on all the information we have
right now on their toxicity.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So not only do you get
a significant exposure

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to mercury vapor if you
have amalgam fillings,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the type of mercury
you're being exposed to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is generally about 10 times more
toxic than the methyl mercury

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
that's coming from fish.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to combine
those two things to get

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
a proper sense of the
comparison of relative exposures

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and relative risks of tuna, tuna
fish consumption, and methyl

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
mercury exposure from tuna
fish, and then the mercury

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
vapor that emanates from
your amalgam fillings.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.788 align:middle line:84%
So in general terms, you get
more mercury from amalgam.

00:05:11.788 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a much more
toxic form of mercury.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And those two combine
to make the risks posed

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
by dental amalgam probably
rather much more significant.
