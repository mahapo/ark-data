00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The childhood amalgam
trial, which was a prospective

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690 align:middle line:84%
randomized study, which is
the top level study you can do

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.710 align:middle line:90%
in science--

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
it means taking a whole
group of children,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
dividing them
randomly, some of whom

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.102 align:middle line:84%
you get amalgams, some of
whom you get composites.

00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, they
said, we're going

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to test on series of
parameters-- urinary

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
mercury, porphyrins, kidney
damage, neurological damage.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:84%
They decided all
that before they ever

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:90%
tested a single child.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're going to do.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They collected all the
data prospectively.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.152 align:middle line:84%
And what it reveals is damage
in every single domain study.

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Every single outcome
that they were

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
looking at that they said, this
might be of concern, so we want

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to study it to see if it's
related to amalgam, all of them

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are being linked to
amalgam exposure.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens to these children
in the course of the study?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we found, looking
at first, urinary mercury,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
then urinary porphyrins, then
eventually kidney dysfunction

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
markers, is that
mercury exposure

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
from dental amalgams in
a dose-dependent fashion,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning the amount of
mercury being released

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
from the amalgams
significantly negatively impact

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:90%
each of those measurements.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that amalgams,
based on the number, the size,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
how many you have,
all of those things,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is related to how much
urinary mercury you have.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It's related to
how much porphyrins

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
you have for the
mercury-associated porphyrins.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps worse,
it's associated

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:90%
with kidney dysfunction.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It actually seems to be
causing ongoing kidney

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
damage at the level of
the proximal tubules.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
When one studies
kidney dysfunction,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
chronic damage to
the proximal tubules

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
is associated with chronic
kidney disease, which

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is the number one kind of kidney
disease in the United States.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
In considering the childhood
amalgam trial findings

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
discussing, they're

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
telling a very compelling
story, a story of damage

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
to the kidney, of mercury
building up in the body,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of causing kidney
damage, brain damage.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a story
that makes sense--

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:90%
very direct.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Very simple to understand.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
If I had somebody from the
American Dental Association

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
sitting next to me and
trying to tell their story,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:90%
what would they say now?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, amalgams are safe.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
They always say that.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you explain that
in light of these findings?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to suspend the
laws of chemistry and physics

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and physiology to
say, yeah, it's just

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
happenstance, coincidence, that
we found damage to the kidney.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It's really safe.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it contributed
to mercury body burden.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.733 align:middle line:90%
That's coincidence.

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
They're actually safe.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can find
it in the urine.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just happenstance,
coincidence.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:90%
It must be safe.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
There is no story.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
The story that
we're telling is one

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that's based on over 100 years
of science about mercury.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We know that mercury is
released from amalgams.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
We know mercury is toxic
to almost every organ

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
system in the body.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
This is what was plausible
before the study.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's overwhelmingly
plausible.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
They have no story
to tell other than,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
we think it's safe because
we think it's safe.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you need me to say
it again, I think it's safe,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:90%
is what they would say.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%
