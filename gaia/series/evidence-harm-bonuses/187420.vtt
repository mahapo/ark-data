00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm Sue Castile.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm an environmental health
scientist with ATSDR.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
ATSDR stands for the
Agency for Toxic Substances

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:90%
and Disease Registry.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.067 align:middle line:84%
We're actually part of CDC
based in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
People should be concerned
about elemental mercury

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
because most people just don't
realize how dangerous it can be

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and what serious
health effects it can

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:90%
have if you're exposed to it.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The more mercury vapor you're
exposed to, the more likely

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
you are to have a health effect.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have one
specific number where

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
we start seeing health effects.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Different people are more
susceptible to mercury toxicity

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
or the health effects
associated with mercury exposure

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:90%
than other people.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And the health effects
are more likely to become

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
more serious the more mercury
vapor you're exposed to,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the higher
concentration of mercury

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
vapor you're exposed to in air.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think one thing that
is important to remember

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
is that mercury,
elemental mercury,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is toxic primarily through
inhalation exposure.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:84%
When people breathe
in mercury vapors,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:84%
we start seeing different health
effects at different levels.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They are basically two
different types of exposure

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:90%
that we see with mercury.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
One is an acute
short-term exposure.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And the health effects that
we see in acute short term

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
exposures, if you're exposed
to a high enough level,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
are headaches, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:90%
You may have trouble breathing.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:90%
You may have chest pains.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You may have inflammation
of your mouth

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and your respiratory tract.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But these are all
reversible health effects

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.092 align:middle line:84%
unless you're exposed to
very, very high levels

00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
when you're removed from
the source of exposure

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and the mercury can
leave your body.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
As you know, a lot of
us have dental amalgams

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that contain mercury,
and the amalgams

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
can be as much as 50% mercury.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And research indicates
that anywhere

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
from four to 19 micrograms
of mercury per day

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
can leach out of your
amalgams into your body.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're exposed to mercury
chronically for a long period

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of time, then we start seeing
much more serious health

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And these health
effects would be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
damage to the central nervous
system, fatigue, irritability,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
being very emotional, memory
loss, shyness, blushing,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
tingling, or tremors
in your hands,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
tingling and shooting pains
in your feet, anorexia.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:90%
You may have gingivitis.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You may have some serious
respiratory problems.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
There are just a lot of
really serious health problems

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
associated with
chronic exposure.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms of
mercury poisoning

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
can be caused by so
many other things

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of times, unless
you know there's been a mercury

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
spill in a house or people have
been occupationally exposed

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to mercury, that may
not be what doctors are

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
looking for when they're
trying to diagnose a person's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
So it is very challenging.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the other challenge
is that some people

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
can have symptoms
of mercury poisoning

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
at much lower exposures
than other people.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
There's just a very
wide variability

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
among people about
how they will respond

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of symptoms
they will have at

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:90%
what different levels.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, if you're
exposed to two chemicals

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, you may
see synergistic or additive

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So the health effects
of the two separately,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
when they're
combined, are greater

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:90%
than you would expect to see.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are a
lot of variables here.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
look at the route of exposure

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%
to the two different chemicals.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at how
long people were exposed

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and the concentrations
of chemicals

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
they were exposed to to
determine whether or not

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
there is a synergistic
or additive effect.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We know when a
woman is pregnant,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
we hope that she's never
exposed to mercury vapors.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a concern
for us, because we

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
know that it can
pass the placenta

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and get into the unborn baby.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And there it could cause
neurological problems

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:90%
in the unborn baby.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So we recommend
that pregnant women

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
avoid being around products
that contain elemental mercury

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and especially avoid
areas if there's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
been a spill or anything,
because it can harm their baby.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It can cause neurological
problems in the unborn baby.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:90%
