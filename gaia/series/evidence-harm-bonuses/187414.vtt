00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Anne Summers
and I'm on the faculty

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.900 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Georgia, in Athens.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And I teach microbiology.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And I do research
using microorganisms.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I've been working for--

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, well-- let's say,
since 1969 on mercury

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:90%
as a subject of interest.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I began working
on this when I was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
a doctoral student at Washington
University in St. Louis.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Up until the late '80s,
I had worked on mercury

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.688 align:middle line:84%
strictly as a phenomenon
of bacterial resistance.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was a nice model system.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You could do all kinds of
physiology and biochemistry.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was fun to do
and easy to work on.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And we had lots of interest
from NIH and NSF in supporting.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember,
very distinctly, it

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
was a winter
afternoon in December,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I think, that I happened to
flip open a copy of "The FASEB

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Journal," which is a
general life sciences,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
medically-oriented journal.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this paper which
had a picture of a sheet

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
with radiography demonstration
of all the mercury that

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:90%
was in this sheet.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's really strange.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was their very
first paper which

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:90%
was published in "The FASEB J."

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And showed that when you
put fillings into an animal,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.635 align:middle line:84%
that the mercury
goes everywhere.

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
In some places,
more than others,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
as has been pointed out in
the jaw, and in the kidney,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
in the g.I. tract--

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:90%
in the gut, in other words.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I picked up the
phone at that point

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and I called Fritz
Lorscheider and I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
said I'd found his
study very interesting.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.853 align:middle line:84%
And that I'd worked on
mercury and bacteria.

00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if
he knew anything

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.725 align:middle line:84%
about mercury-resistant
bacteria.

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said he'd never
heard of such a thing.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So we had a conversation
that ended up

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.343 align:middle line:84%
in establishing a
plan to go forward

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate with him
because they'd already

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:90%
begun to work on the monkeys.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
They did all of the
housing of the animals,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the feeding of the animals,
and so forth up in Calgary.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And they put the fillings in,
in a regular dental oratory

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that
they had there.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they sent us the
samples of monkey feces,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
freshly collected each day
or actually, twice a week.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.303 align:middle line:84%
We then immediately did
bacteriological work on them

00:02:14.303 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that allowed us to see--
the two things that we were

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
particularly interested in were
how many of the microorganisms

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that we were cultivating--
and cultivated

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
three different types of
bacteria from the monkey feces.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had a way to figure
out how many of them

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
were mercury-resistant
and what proportion were

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:90%
mercury-resistant of the total.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And what proportion also carried
antibiotic resistance genes.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we were
interested in asking that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
question was because we already
knew-- the whole world knew--

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.555 align:middle line:84%
that the genes for
mercury-resistance-- well,

00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I should say the whole
world of microbiology.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should actually
say the small world people

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
interested in
antibiotic resistance

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
in bacteria knew that the
genes for mercury resistance

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
were carried on bacterial
plasmids, which also carried

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.302 align:middle line:90%
antibiotic resistance genes.

00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And now bacterial plasmids
are a little supernumerary

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
chromosomes that bacteria
can exchange with each other,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
sort of like little
apps that you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
can exchange with your
friends that allow

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:90%
you to be resistant to things.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the mercury
resistance genes

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
being on the same plasmids as
antibiotic resistance genes,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
if you expose a bacterial
community to antibiotics,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of course, that will cause
the bacteria to persist

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
as antibiotic
resistance bacteria.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And people were
concerned about that

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
already because they knew
that overuse of antibiotics

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
was causing a
prevalence and spread

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.462 align:middle line:84%
of antibiotic multi-resistance
in humans, which is a problem.

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were interested
in this experiment

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to see whether or not
exposure of animals

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
with their microorganisms
to mercury, resulting

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
in the exposure of the
microbes themselves to mercury

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
would cause a persistence
and prevalence.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Not only of the mercury
resistance, but also

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
the antibiotic resistance
because of genetic linkage.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
If you pick the
mercury resistance,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
you can carry along the
antibiotic resistance, as well.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So that was the purpose
of those experiments.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And that paper was published
in "Antimicrobial Agents

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and Chemotherapy"
in April of '93.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And it made the
case that exposure

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of these primates, which
are a reasonably good model

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
for human biology and
microbiology, to mercury

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
resulted in a
proliferation of microbes

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
in their gut that
had both mercury

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
resistance and multiple
antibiotic resistances.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And that in the early monkeys
that we worked with them on,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the fillings were taken
out after two months.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we could see a decline
in mercury-resistant bacteria

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and antibiotic multi-resistant
bacteria after that period.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So that clearly associated
them with the exposure

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to mercury of the
microbiota of the animals

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:90%
that we were looking at.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.853 align:middle line:84%
And the animals didn't have any
exposure to any other mercury.

00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple
of the cases, they

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:84%
were working with
radioactive mercury.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't an issue of getting
the mercury from their diet

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But they also were not,
of course, eating fish.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And we arranged with them ahead
of time that the monkeys were--

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
the kind of animal
chow that they

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
had had no antibiotics in it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
laboratory chows which

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.497 align:middle line:84%
are amended with antibiotics
so that the animals will not

00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
come down with
something while they're

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
doing an experiment
on something else.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have data on the
development of mercury

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and multiple antibiotic
resistance in the normal

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
flora-- and that included
both the oral flora,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as the g.I. tract
flora in these animals--

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
that had amalgam fillings.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And the only source of mercury
was from the amalgam fillings.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in all those cases,
there was a proliferation

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of antibiotic multi-resistance,
along with mercury resistance

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
subsequent to the
installation of the fillings.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was statistically
significant.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We did statistics
on those data and it

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.195 align:middle line:84%
was a statistically
significant difference

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
after the installation
of the amalgams,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for both the mercury resistance
and the antibiotic resistance.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:90%
