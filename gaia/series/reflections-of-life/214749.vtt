[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think life could become
very tedious and boring if it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.123 align:middle line:90%
was a bed of roses.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many
thorns that you have

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%
to pull out and walk through.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what life is about.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.125 align:middle line:90%
It's about the ups and downs.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
You are the sum total
of those experiences

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.395 align:middle line:90%
that you've worked at.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:01:15.708 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:10%
To live on my own and
hermetize, become a hermit,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.335 align:middle line:10%
I thought that's the ideal
spiritual situation to be in.

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.715 align:middle line:84%
But I've realized
that's not the answer.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Time has taught me that you
can't live as an island.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.595 align:middle line:90%
You need your fellow man.

00:01:50.595 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself as a
reflection in your fellow man.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.555 align:middle line:84%
And you learn from your fellow
man good things and bad things,

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
provided, of course, you
mix with the right people.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Being alone is one thing.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But being lonely is a totally
different kettle of fish.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I spent three
months in New York.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't alone, alone.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I was alone amongst
a lot of people.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.365 align:middle line:84%
And it's the loneliest
time I've ever had.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.573 align:middle line:84%
You can be lonely
anywhere on this planet.

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.116 align:middle line:84%
It's your state of mind
which determines loneliness.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I think loneliness
is an emptiness that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:90%
is frightening and scary.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
There's this empty, dark void.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.235 align:middle line:90%
And you plod around in it.

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:10%
I think loneliness is about
a feeling of being lost.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:10%
And you are wanting to find
a direction and a search

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:10%
for something.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're uncertain what that
something is or should be.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It's partly depression as well.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.515 align:middle line:84%
I think depression and
loneliness go hand in hand.

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I also know when it's coming.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Then I say to myself,
be good to yourself.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.563 align:middle line:90%
Be kind to yourself.

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.373 align:middle line:84%
It's inevitable that your
flame is going to dim.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
A loneliness, I suppose,
is part of life.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Everybody experiences
loneliness.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:90%
You learn to live with it.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:90%
You have to go through it.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't try and escape it.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:90%
See it through.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Face reality.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.825 align:middle line:90%
And see it for what it is.

00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Life is not about tricks.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.276 align:middle line:90%
It's about realities.

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
If you take a trick
as a solution,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.843 align:middle line:84%
you're tricking and
kidding yourself.

00:05:34.843 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got to solve these
problems in a real way.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You've got to face
it and look into it.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.531 align:middle line:90%
It's a gentle confrontation.

00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Become one with it.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Embrace it.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Work with it.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Or put it on the
shelf for a while.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Stand back.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.453 align:middle line:84%
And say, OK, I'll
recognize you tomorrow.

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:10%
I am now in that
stage of my life

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:10%
where I'm becoming
more and more aware

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.825 align:middle line:10%
that it's now towards the end.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's lovely being
on the open sea.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm becoming aware
that there's land ahead.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.393 align:middle line:90%
There's an end to the journey.

00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.225 align:middle line:84%
The only certainty
in life is death.

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:48.485 align:middle line:84%
You arrived naked
and you depart naked.

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
that all these material

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:84%
things that you've
gathered, that's

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
no fulfillment of
spirit and life.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of mind.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It's what you've acquired in
your soul, which is wealth.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an answer
to, why am I here?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.815 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe to work at this.

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The Twana have a
wonderful thing or saying.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
They say, you
brought me the heart.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You're talking with
the heart again today.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the heart.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the head.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.493 align:middle line:84%
That generates a more positive,
loving spirit within yourself.

00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is
love and do to others

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
as you'd like them to do to you.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one way of
reaching a point of happiness.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
