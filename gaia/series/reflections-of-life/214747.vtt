This is-- This is about
as good as it gets.

[LAUGHING]

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to get
better as we get older,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
but there'll probably
be a tipping point,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
where we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just have to be
willing to kind of slide

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
together down some
slippery slope.

>> When we got married, we
worked out a series of vows,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
which we wrote out, and
we said to each other--

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't really remember
what they were, except

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that it was something like that
we hope one day we will sit here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
in our old age, still
together, and just

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
enjoy this life that we've
been given, you know.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe we do need to renew our
vows so that we remember what we

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But the one that stands
out quite strongly,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
which I feel we're
embodying now, is,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
"May our home be a place where
people can accept themselves,"

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
which was-- when
we drew that up,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:90%
it was a beautiful intention.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.295 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we're
really living that.

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
The other was that we don't
hide behind each other,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have our own
identity and our own one--

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
one with ourselves, that we're
not hiding behind another person

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.535 align:middle line:84%
or expecting them to fulfill
what is important to us.

00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:10%
What is often hard to
accept, when you live so much

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:10%
inside yourself, is that
the person in front of you

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.375 align:middle line:10%
is very different to you.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I think in a marriage, that's
the hardest just thing--

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to realize that some of the
differences that you fell

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
in love with in
the beginning are

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.583 align:middle line:90%
the things that bug you later.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I've seen that
in myself and with others.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's really those are
the little daily things that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.876 align:middle line:84%
need to be communicated and
set down and made a compromise.

00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I see that if I leave the
butter out after I make toast,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.393 align:middle line:90%
that my wife is furious--

00:03:38.393 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --daily.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I think the one way
I can show a commitment

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to the relationship is to either
not have toast at all [LAUGHS]

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
or to have toast without butter
or to put the butter away.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
talk to her about it.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
analytical about it.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I just-- one--

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
one picks it up.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there are things
I do that will infuriate her

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:90%
that I don't pick up.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:90%
She'll tell me.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.765 align:middle line:84%
She's not scared
of me in that way.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%

stages in a married life.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
There's the initial
excitement of being together,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course, the utter
astonishment of having children.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.232 align:middle line:90%
That-- that was just--

00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:90%
it was just wonderful, beyond--

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.345 align:middle line:90%
beyond measure.

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was
really hard work.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
We had to earn a living.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I had to travel to work.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There was times we
had to be apart,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.923 align:middle line:90%
times where we came together.

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't resist
it or complain.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:90%
We just did it.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And in retrospect,
that doing of it

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
was a wonderful kind of
cementing of the relationship.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:40.875 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.686 align:middle line:84%
Since then, I've
stopped traveling.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We spend all our time
together now, pretty much.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:90%
We sleep together.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
We eat together.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We drink together.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's wonderful.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole new
adjustment that happens.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really precious,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and people talk about,
oh, it's difficult

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:90%
when your children leave home.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have
left home long ago.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:90%
But for us, it's been wonderful.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We've had time on our own,
and we make as much use of it

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%
as we can.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's very
important to find something,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
when your children leave home,
that the two of you do together

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that is meaningful and
nourishing to both of you.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
When I look around at my
family and my friends,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that's often when couples
go different ways.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Then one feels that you're
living two separate lives,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's very difficult to
find a place of connection

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
because your priorities have
been work or children or both.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, none of
those are something

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.756 align:middle line:90%
that you share anymore.

00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I never give advice because
it's always going to be,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't take it anyway.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But for us, what's really
helped was having, as Margie

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
says, not only a common
direction in our life,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
but a sense that we actually
deliberately do things together

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.085 align:middle line:90%
that are meaningful to us.

00:07:54.085 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Every night, we
gather around sunset,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:90%
and we watch the sun go down.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, ritual, in that way,
was always a part of our life.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So we always have
watched the sun go down.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It was always important for us.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And when the children were
younger, they would join us.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
And now that they're not
here, we sit together,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about
them all the time.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Not all the time, though.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's quite a deliberate,
ritualized part of the day.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:90%
So we make it precious.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
what we try and do.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And it does become precious, not
so much because we, as it were,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
set out to make
something precious,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
but we decided
what-- how we wanted

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to spend that time together.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be
precious, which is wonderful.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel quite strongly,
growing older, that

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
however much I look back to a
more romantic postcard version

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of what life could
be, that something

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.025 align:middle line:84%
fantastically, wonderfully
ordinary has taken its place.

00:09:56.025 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Ordinary is extraordinary.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
If you think of your life,
it's the little things,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
the ordinary little things
that are very meaningful,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:90%
and you don't forget them.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Little kindnesses,
little actions

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.636 align:middle line:84%
that you don't expect to
happen are the ordinary.

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
most ordinary things

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that we humans are made to do
is to be present and listen

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
only when we stop

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that we see the extraordinary
in the ordinary, when we really

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:90%
stop and feel and hear.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In the same way that the
leaves change in spring and fall

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and autumn, and that certain
birds appear at certain times

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of the year, and the sun
comes and the wind goes,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:90%
all of that is part of my life.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And she is absolutely,
intimately as much a part of it

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:90%
as all of that.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I live in the felt and my wife.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how it feels.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so pleased.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to think, you
know, that she feels something

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:90%
of the same.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
almost the inevitability

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of looking around and
finding you here next to me,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that I lift
the blind in the morning

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and see the sun come up.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.797 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:12:17.797 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's nothing.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --has been a discovery for
me that I did not anticipate.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And I wish it for everybody.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think if one
gives oneself a chance,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.373 align:middle line:90%
it'll appear all by itself.

00:12:32.373 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
If I look over one day
and she's not there,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:90%
it'll be heartbreaking.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.975 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely true.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I will then, as best
I can, honor the life

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:90%
that we've had together.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
She is my life, and
my life will continue.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:84%
My-- saying she
is my life doesn't

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
mean that I have no
life without her.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Saying she is my life means
that when she's with me, it's--

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:90%
it's full of her.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It means that when she
dies, and I'm still around,

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that my life will consist of
whatever there is around me

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and that my--

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
almost my duty to her
would be to live that life

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:90%
as best as I can.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
As she mentioned, we undertook
not to hide behind each other,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:90%
that I only live through you.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I live through you, but
that's just the beginning.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not the end so that
when you die, I'll weep.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll build you a fantastic
grave overlooking the copies,

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have sirens and choirs
of angels all over the place.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, I'll play
music with the angels.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how it feels to me.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not looking
forward to it.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like you
are-- the choir of angels.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.095 align:middle line:90%
Shall I bring them on now?

00:14:44.095 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the way I would honor
her would be to get on with

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
the life that is left for me.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.943 align:middle line:84%
That's what she would wish
for me more than anything.

00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
She would want me to see the sun
come up, to dig in the garden,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to look after visitors, to
make the bed properly at last.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think that she would
trust me that however sad it

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
was, that sadness would become
my life and would be manure

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
for whatever last days are left,
which are probably not going

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.396 align:middle line:90%
to be very many, you know.

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But that would be a
huge event for me.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.765 align:middle line:84%
I've got a little poem that
I'd like to recite, if I may.

00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll try and remember it.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.376 align:middle line:84%
I shaved my head for the
children of Palestine.

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.566 align:middle line:84%
I swept up the leaves
in the Jewish cemetery.

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
My wife wrapped presents
for the old ladies

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.805 align:middle line:90%
in the frail care home.

00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.655 align:middle line:84%
My daughter washed the
dishes after lunch.

00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.100 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha of compassion
has 84,000 hands.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Which of those are yours?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:90%
