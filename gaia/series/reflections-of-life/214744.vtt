00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I think play means exploring,
experimenting, being curious.

Looking, seeing, being
in the body, being alive.

We shall not cease

and the end of all
our exploring will

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:10%
be to arrive where we
started and to know

And afterwards I had surgery and
didn't have to do anything more.

It was done and I felt like
