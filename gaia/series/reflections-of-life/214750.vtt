when these things disturbed me

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
The world consists

that people tell each other.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
These stories tend
to pin you down,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and we pin each other down
with our stories as well.

It's projections
that you receive

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
from the world around you,
building a reality, which

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%

inside yourself which

will keep on reinforcing
certain negative perceptions.
