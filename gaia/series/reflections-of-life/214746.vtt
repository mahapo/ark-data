>> I must go down
to the seas again,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:90%
to the lonely sea and the sky.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And all I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That poem has always
struck very deeply with me

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.985 align:middle line:84%
because the sea
is a great solace.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's so wide.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It gives you perspective.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%

where my heart is, where my soul
sings again, where I can say,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'm Christie.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that matters.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm Christie-- doesn't matter if
I shake now while I'm saying it.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I am Christie.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK to just be Christie.

I don't have to
be something else.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
At this point in my
life, I feel a little bit

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
like a ship that's
gone astray, and I'm

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.865 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the wind that's
going to blow me back on course.

You lose something
of yourself, and you

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of grief because
of loss, loss of love,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
loss of family life,
and there was just

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
a huge load of stress packed
right on top of each other.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the same time, I
realized I was diagnosed with

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
that I hadn't actually

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
been dealing with because
I'd just been throwing myself

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.265 align:middle line:84%
into work and my family and, you
know, trying to make ends meet.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:90%

sort of went, [BLOWS].

and I basically fell apart.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
really difficult place,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you can lose perspective
very quickly.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And you start
questioning yourself.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You start saying,
what am I doing wrong?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
to deserve this?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to
feel what I was feeling.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to feel sad or
grief or anything like that.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just
power through it.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't taught about how to
understand what my emotions are.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
If you don't understand
what you're feeling,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not
allowed to have feelings,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.545 align:middle line:90%
you tend to suppress it all.

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't work
because, eventually, it's

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
going to come out.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going to shatter
into little pieces,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going
to say, oh, look, here's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
a little piece of grief.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Here's a little piece of sorrow.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to have grief and
sorrow, and it's OK for it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to last a long time.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Positivity does not
mean suppressing

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.475 align:middle line:90%
the negative emotions.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.632 align:middle line:84%
Positivity means that
you feel those emotions,

00:04:11.632 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but you know you're
going to be OK,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.625 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
change one day.

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.545 align:middle line:84%
I am scared about
what the future holds.

00:04:27.545 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
A very hard thing is to
see how other people worry

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and what they're feeling,
for my kids especially.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them to
be stressed by me.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
be there for them.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But I can't take
away their pain.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the sad thing.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.825 align:middle line:90%
I can't take away their sadness.

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:08.625 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But I can allow them
to have their pain

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and to express their
emotions and say,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to be sad about it.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And when crying gets easier,
laughing gets easier.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So once you cry, you leave
a little bit of space

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:90%
for the joy to come in.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I think Parkinson's, for me, has
been a silver lining of a cloud.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a call for
me to go slowly.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you need
to go slowly in life,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
not just because you're
tired and exhausted,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
but because you need to step
back and say, what patterns am I

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
repeating over and over that's
putting me in a place where

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.955 align:middle line:90%
my body is aching and tired?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I tend to see the best
in everybody else.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see that
I deserve it as well.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.826 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
That has been my struggle
is that I'm not sure

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.855 align:middle line:90%
that I deserve kindness.

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm still not sure, but--

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:90%
but now I can see--

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:84%
now I'm-- I'm more clear on
seeing how other people can--

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:90%
how kindness works.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
All it comes down to in
the end is loving yourself

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
because if you can love
yourself, you can love others.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're kind to yourself,
you can be kind to others.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is about the ability to
see the beauty in somebody else

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.965 align:middle line:84%
and to be kind to
the other parts.

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
That love, which is so
intangible, but it's there--

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.803 align:middle line:84%
it's real, and it's a miracle
that we love each other at all.

00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete
and utter miracle.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Being kind, now, I see, is
about opening yourself and being

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that is about
reaching out to people

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.995 align:middle line:84%
when you are scared and
when you are lonely.

00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And even when I'm
depressed and miserable

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and the medicine is not working
or my body is really inflamed

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sick and
I can't get out of bed

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.122 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to be
working, and even those times,

00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who believe in me.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm eternally grateful, and I
cannot ever say how much people

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:90%
have done for me.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:10%
It just blows my
mind that people

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:10%
can be so beautiful
and loving and kind.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.004 align:middle line:84%
And I have the most warm,
generous, amazing souls.

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
People have come to me in
my deepest, darkest moments

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and brought me out
into the light again.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So my daughter says, if you want
a flower, you'll find a flower.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:90%
You'll find it somewhere.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So the learning of where the
flowers are in my life, that's

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
been my journey.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So even sometimes when
I've had a really bad day,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.497 align:middle line:84%
then I go outside
at night, and I just

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
look at the moon and the clouds.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you just think,
this is the universe,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:90%
this whole universe.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
We're all made of stardust.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Just being is a miracle.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Just being alive is a miracle.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And instead of berating
my poor, shaky body,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I should actually be
saying, bloody well done

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
for getting through this.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm proud of you.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for shaking
because you're telling me

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.125 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not doing
something right, that I need

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.375 align:middle line:90%
