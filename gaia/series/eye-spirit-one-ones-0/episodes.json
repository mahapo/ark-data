Sonia will awaken your psychic abilities, introduce you to the spirit world, and help you remember what you came here to do. Encouraged by her mother to expand her abilities, she began giving readings at age twelve and has been helping people connect with their souls and their guides for over thirty years. \r\n\r\nPart 2: An early student of B. K. S. Iyengar, who stressed alignment and therapeutic benefit, Kofi Busia is a master of personal attention and maximizing students' progress, and his classes are among the most popular at Omega.  What attracts people, in addition to the physical asana practice, are the ethical and moral disciplines that deepen one's way of life and philosophy â€“ mindfulness, joy, right action. Kofia notes that one of the most valuable commodities that yoga has to offer is steadiness of mind. Our challenge is to resist the obstacles, both inner and outer, that take us away from our focus on whatever goals we have set.","teaser":"From the Omega Institute, first meet Sonia Choquette, intuitive, spiritual teacher, and healer, who will awaken your psychic abilities, introduce you to the spirit world, and help you remember what you came here to do.
