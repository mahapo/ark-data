is the same as a nautilus shell?

We're all just figuring out

I know that I've
been back there.

I know that I'm
going this direction.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman standing
in the space suddenly.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And she was looking at me.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
But she was not human.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
She had her eye bones going
all the way back to about here

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
where her temples are
instead of these little knobs

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that all Homo
erectus skulls have.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
She had bone points on her
forehead and on her cheeks

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and on her chin.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And she was wearing
these robes that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
had the cowl that was
back and constellations,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
symbols, and sacred geometric
patterns going all the way

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
down the robes that shimmered
like they were velvet

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and satin at the same time.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the symbols were
glowing in the space.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's just staring at me.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell that
her ears are pointed

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and coming through her hair.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So I get up and I start
moving towards her.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I get to
about the distance

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are apart, the
edge of our energy fields met.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it was as if I
dropped on a pair of VR goggles

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and full audio-visual sense
of total connection with her.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And she says into my
mind, I know who you are.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just a voice.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a stream of
feeling and consciousness.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I was in a ship docking
with a massive mothership.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I was on a massive
platform of a bridge

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
with windows looking
down at a planet.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I was entering a
massive chamber with all

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of these different galactic
species all around the chamber.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I was looking down
at Earth and choosing

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
to go there to help
the people here.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in a
stone circle looking up

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
with a sword in my hand and
a ship flying down above me.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
They were moments of
our memories together.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was sharing with me
the stream of that memory,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as a symbol of the
five, six, seven pentagram,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
the hexagram, and the
heptagram connected

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been drawing
on my sketchbook

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:90%
since I was in high school.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that as the
sigil that connected me

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to who I am as a star being and
as someone who brings forward

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the universal codes
of the infinite

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
eternal into this
layer of reality.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It was an overwhelming
greeting to say the least.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And I just I bowed to her.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I said--

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, these two
redneck guys walk in the space.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I call them rednecks because
I grew up in Western North

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Carolina, ducking
chainsaw hat, full gear,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
the flannel on in the
middle of Burning Man.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And they're going in there.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
They're drunk and
they're probably

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
tripping at the same
time and looking around.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:90%
"Whoa, man.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at this place.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Dang."

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And then they notice her.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, "Whoa, damn.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Some crazy shit in here, man."

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they go into one of
these control panels that was

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:90%
used to activate the lighting.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're just like in it.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And she's standing
there looking at me.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And she glances over at them.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
She glances back at me.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And she says into my mind,
not all of you are ready.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it came across
kind of like that moment

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
in "The Fifth Element"
where she looks up war.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:90%
And you get these flashes.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was the flash of
a guy shooting a shotgun,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.352 align:middle line:90%
shooting a thing.

00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:54.935 align:middle line:84%
And then he's shaving his head,
and then he's in the military.

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a
bigger gun and he's

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:90%
like [IMITATES MACHINE GUN].

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And then he's listening
to his heavy metal music.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a bigger
gun and it's a tank.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It was the journey of someone
who ends up on the wrong path

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and ends up in war
and creating war

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing
what they're doing,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
just following orders and
destroying and killing people.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are definitely
maybe not ready.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
as I felt that sort

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of painful reflection,
I also looked at them.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was so thankful
that they were there

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
because they gave me
this contrast and also

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
this amazing sense of
reality and tangibility.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And they saw her.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:90%
She's there.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to her
telepathically.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
And here's these redneck guys--

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That see her too, right?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me that sense
of reality and grittiness.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, I realized
that I know these guys.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I went to high school with them.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I did keg stands
at their parties.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's an aspect of
their lives that I understand

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and I love.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know that a
lot of them grew up.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Their dad beat them.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They turn into bullies
because of that.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
have another choice

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
of what they can do for a living
because their parents want

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
them to stay home and
take over the farm.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.835 align:middle line:90%
So they're pushed into FFA.

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is the only
route they've got.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't do it they're
sent off to military school

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:90%
or put in the army.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reality to that
sort of cycle and pattern.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I sent her my sense
of that, my sense of them

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and my sense of that
journey, as well

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
as I sent her the sense of
all of the amazing people

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that I could think
of who are ready.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
I said to her in my mind.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, and enough of us are.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.555 align:middle line:90%
She looked at me and she smiled.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And she sends me
this wave of love

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:90%
that just swelled my heart.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
And it took my breath away.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said into
my being, thank you

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:90%
for honoring your people.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had passed
some kind of test.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
This was not about me to judge
them or her judging them.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:84%
This was about me
saying, it's OK.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was overwhelmed
by the feeling

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of this connection with her,
and the love that she sent me,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and this moment of
us being together

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:90%
that I just bowed to her.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And I just, thank you.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And I came up and she was gone.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like that.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Just gone.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
around this art thing.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The redneck guys
are still there.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I look around.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Nobody noticed.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Redneck guys are standing there.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And at one moment, a guy,
he's looking at the thing.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:90%
He looks over and he does that.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And I knew.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:90%
She was there.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Now she's gone.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
People noticed.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Did she teleport out?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And I left the art
space right then.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I walked outside just to know.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I went out of the
cone Stargate Temple,

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:90%
went out into the desert.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.172 align:middle line:84%
The first light of
sunrise was just

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
starting to show
up on the horizon.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and there
is no one anywhere.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And I knew she--

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:90%
bloop.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And I started to walk
around this temple structure

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and really look at it and really
feel what had just happened.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And some part of me just
started building up this energy.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like connecting
to the four directions.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Like here I am.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I just made contact
with my star family.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:90%
And I started running.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And I started running
back towards the city.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- just felt so
good to run in my body.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm running, I
started hearing this tone.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.278 align:middle line:84%
And it's building
up inside of me.

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And this happened once
when I was in high school.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
Kundalini experience.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And a tone went through my body.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So I just go with it.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm running.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like I'm getting
lighter and lighter and faster

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and faster.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And the tone is getting
higher and higher and higher.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's building
up through my body.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.813 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking off into
the distance at the city

00:11:37.813 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:90%
as I'm traveling towards it.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And a light explodes in front
of me, like in the city--

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
just flashes of light.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And I say one.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And I turned.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.885 align:middle line:84%
And on the city,
another light flashes.

00:11:46.885 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said two.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I turn and
another light flashes.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I say three.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Turn.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Another light.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Four.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Another light.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Five.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm all the way back
facing towards the temple

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:10%
with its light on top.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:10%
And I see flashes on top.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Six.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm running
in like a spiral.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm spiraling in
towards the center.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And I get in towards the center
to where I'm going to stop.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:90%
And I look up.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:10%
The sky turns.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I say seven.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:10%
And I shoot out of my body.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the wormhole you've
seen in the movie "Contact."

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like light waves
going everywhere and stars.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And then all of sudden, I'm
in this endless, empty, dark

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:10%
space.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are points
like stars all around me

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
in every direction.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And as I turn my
attention to each of them,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
the light point emerges and
becomes a galactic ambassador

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:90%
looking at me.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.365 align:middle line:90%
And I turn to the next.

00:12:49.365 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And I turn to the next.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And each of them are
different species--

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
blue skinned, and red
skinned, and white skinned,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and humanoid, and
very nonhumanoid,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and looking like
all kinds of beings.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:10%
I was looking around at
the actual beings captured

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.495 align:middle line:10%
in "Star Trek" and
"Star Wars" and all

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:10%
of the fantasy movies
you've ever seen.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.037 align:middle line:90%
And they're all there.

00:13:20.037 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking at me
and they're aware of me.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:90%
And they send me this feeling.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's 73
of them in the room somehow.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling and the light
impression, the language,

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:90%
just says welcome.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has this feeling like
we've been waiting for you.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm standing on
the desert in my body.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my
shoes are smoking.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And I look around.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I'm back
here on my body on Earth,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:84%
but I can still see all those
light points in every direction

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:90%
even through the ground--

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
it was full 360
every direction--

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and still get the
impression of the beings.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bilocated now in this
astral galactic council chamber

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and in my body
standing on the playa.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:90%
And what do I do now?

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And it was almost as if as
soon as the question was there,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:10%
I knew exactly why I was there.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
My job was to be one beacon,
one transmitter connected

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to a network of other beings
all around the planet who

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
may or may not be
conscious of the work

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
doing this morning

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and to transmit the state of
human consciousness, our level

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of progress, so to speak, to the
rest of this galactic community

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and request from them a
vote on whether or not

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
we're ready to join
that galactic community

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and become part of that council.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I knew from some big
book that I had in my memory

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that I could request a
timeline for that vote.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
It could be a month long.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:90%
It could be a day long.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
within a few hours.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I knew they had to follow
whatever protocol I requested

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:90%
after the first vote was given.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was very clear in my state
of I'm here to do this vote.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're doing now.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And they were in agreement.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I began to move
across the playa.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And walking across
the desert, passed

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
by this couple that were
sitting together just

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere by
themselves hugging each other.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I felt all of their
sensations, their love,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
their connection,
their sensuality--

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
all of these parts
of this moment

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that they were having
with each other.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if it was
streaming through me

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and going into this space
where it could be seen

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:90%
by all of these other beings.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, in the east,
this light goes super bright.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And I turn and I look at it.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's shining.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's these white beings
with rainbow crystalline-like

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
eyebrows, and hair that
was like spectral strands,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and eyes with very, very deep
purple, and very human-like

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:90%
face.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're looking at me.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And they say, "With that,
we would welcome you

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:90%
into this council."

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was the first vote.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:90%
It was a vote for love.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a vote for connection
and a vote for unity.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
that vote, I knew I

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:90%
could establish the time frame.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how many
more before sunrise?

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> How many more will vote yes
for us before the sun comes up?

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the sun was
going to come up in

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:90%
like an hour and a half.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I asked them
how many before sunrise,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
they sent this pulse of
light through my body

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that was checking how many
people I could cross paths

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:90%
with before the sun would rise.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
That was a way of them
kind of saying, well,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
is this going to be a big enough
sample size that you can get?

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And is the networks
around the world

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
provide enough of a sample?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And the response was,
you have until sunrise.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So you just started
to meet people.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So I just started booking
it, walking across the playa.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't looking that
good for us for a while.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of
people who's angry

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:84%
because drugs didn't work,
or they were hungover,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
or their girlfriend disappeared,
or their boyfriend was

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
seemingly attracted to
somebody else last night,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and all the bunk of humanity.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
looking at all of that

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and them going eh.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And every vote of no was as if
a blindspot formed in the sky.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.767 align:middle line:90%
It was as if there was a--

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
you know when you stare
at a light too long,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and then you kind of get the
negative impression of that?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It was like getting the
opposite of the light

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
there as the marker
that they had voted no.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started to really wonder
if this was the right timing

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:90%
for this to happen.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I felt as though I

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:90%
was completely neutral.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't really matter.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if they voted
no, I'd just keep going.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been here so long and
done this work for so long.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's totally OK.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm human--

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> A Sirian watching the grass.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> A Sirian watching the
grass as Reuben Langdon says.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And I both am human.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also from
different star systems.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
that balance in me

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
made it OK whatever
would happen.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't look good.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:90%
It was looking pretty rough.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:10%
And as I traveled
across the playa feeling

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:10%
kind of surrendered
to what would happen,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:10%
something began to change.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And what changed was
the sunrise coming.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The clouds turned into
peach, and pink, and purple,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and gold, and silver edges.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The light reflecting off of
these icy waves of clouds

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
had turned the desert ground
pink with purple cracks.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
The mountains became these
red, beautiful sentinels.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
The sky was becoming
a full rainbow.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I moved around, the
more people that I passed,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
the more I found these humans
who are going through whatever

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
they were going through were
suddenly taking a breath,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
melting into love,
seeing the beauty.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And the wave continued
and continued.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it got very
close to sunrise,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I rounded my way back to
the temple, the last part

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of Burning Man that would burn
that night where everybody

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
places their prayers
for their loved

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
ones, and lost ones, and
children, and dogs, and cats,

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
All the love for what they've
had and what they've lost

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
ends up at the temple.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm headed
straight towards it.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's thousands and
thousands of people all around.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They're just mass around
this ancient Japanese temple

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I move
towards this temple,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I began to start getting the
stream of the whole field

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:90%
of all of them.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And it starts just
becoming overwhelming.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
buildup of love.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I could see votes changing
and turning to good.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was just like the mass
of all human culture and emotion

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
just laying itself
out before me.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
There was still a few
minutes before sunrise.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So I walked around
to where I could

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
see the entire temple
and all of the people

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and watch the sunrise
at the same time

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and felt the sort of pulse
of conversation and sparking

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts and considerations
moving and pulsing

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just surrendered and
let it all move and happen

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and watched.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And it started to look good
and then look a little rough.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it look
good and look rough.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:10%
And then that spark of
light hit the horizon,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:10%
blasted me in the eyes.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Two lights went bright.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.053 align:middle line:90%
One went dark.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And then bright, bright, bright,
bright, bright, bright, bright,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
bright, bright, bright,
bright, bright, bright.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And the wave hit
me of acceptance.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're down.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:19.275 align:middle line:84%
And the playa all around me
erupted in cheers, people--

00:22:19.275 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:90%
yes-- screaming for the sunrise.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But for me, it was the cry
of a people claiming that moment

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of victory that they could go
forth as a galactic people,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that they could become part
of this great community among

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
the stars, that we could
resolve our differences,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that we could see through
our deepest darkness,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and know the gift of light
and love inside of us.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It was both the greatest
moment of victory

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I've ever felt probably in
my entire existence and also

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:90%
the shortest one.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Because as all of that
happened and the scream

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and the everything,
then suddenly it

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:90%
was like time to get to work.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking
towards the sunrise.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:90%
And beings are showing up.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And they're asking me questions.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I just go into
this deep, deep process

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
with them literally
for many, many hours

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
walking out into the
middle of the desert.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't stop until the
sun was almost overhead.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And I had, in that time,
I went through and sorted

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:10%
all of these symbols and
sigils of organizations

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:10%
and governments that
were either down,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:10%
or that could support
this process of what

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:10%
was happening, or would
be against this process

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:10%
of sovereignty among the
planet people and transition

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:10%
to this new way of
being, and did my best

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:10%
to just offer what
I knew in feedback.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:10%
And there were many
things I couldn't offer

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:10%
but that I felt were coming
through this grid of people

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:10%
dreaming, and meditating
in temples, and all

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:10%
of these different places as
we're sorting out how this all

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:10%
was going to go down.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was also clear
that it was possible

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that it could only
take us seven years

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and that, in the time period
of the next seven years,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:90%
we would end up in 2012.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, we work our way
through the seven chakras,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
getting the things
cleared on the planet.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And we're ready.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's starships
coming down and landing

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
on the playa in 2012 as the
first galactic city of Earth,

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and then it happens
all over the worlds.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And all the people sync up.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's not what
it was able to happen.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
other reasons for that

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we
could discuss later.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.167 align:middle line:10%
But CERN is--

00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I've heard you
mention that before.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> --a high probability for one
of the major reasons why that

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:90%
may not have happened.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.515 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have to
get into that today.

00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe next time.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But in terms of
this time with them,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I was shown so many of the ways
that these species went through

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
their transition to becoming
part of this galactic

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them was offering

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
a gift of knowledge and
wisdom about their way

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:90%
of making that crossing.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about
teleportation, and body

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
shielding, and specific
energy dynamics,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and overcoming the
fear and the pain that

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
comes from lifetimes of trauma
of living on a planet where you

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
have giant beasts that eat
your species where you're not

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the top of the food chain,
and so many other things

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that I just accepted
into myself and--

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.942 align:middle line:84%
>> And those-- all that
came in that night?

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything came
in that morning.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was all a stream.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And then when it was
done, I looked back.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And I was many miles
outside of Burning Man

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:10%
and the trash fence in the city.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even remember
crossing the fence.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:90%
There was no fence.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I just walked.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I teleported through it.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:10%
But when I got out
there, and I looked back,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:10%
I saw that many, many
others had walked out

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:10%
into the desert that day.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And our cars were
lined up at the fence.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And people were called
towards the sunrise that day.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was not just for me.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:10%
But as I traveled
back into the city,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:10%
and I looked at these humans,
I felt a different kind

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:10%
of affinity for all of these
people, an affinity that

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:10%
was more like an adult looking
at a child or a teenager

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:10%
and knowing that they've
got a lot to figure it out,

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:10%
but that we could do it, that
they're going to make it,

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:10%
that they're going to
become adults and mature

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:10%
at the right time, and that
there's a way through this.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.592 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
experience communing

00:26:50.592 --> 00:26:51.675 align:middle line:90%
with the galactic council.

00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And I couldn't
go home after that.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I just stayed traveling
for years and would go around

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
looking for
ambassadors, and jedi,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and the people who were ready
for this kind of information

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:90%
and ready to make contact.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'd call in starships,
and let them have experiences,

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and stopped doing that
so much after a while

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
once I realized that a lot of
times, they'd just see a ship

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and then just be like, whoa.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:10%
Is it going to happen again?

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:10%
Do it again.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:10%
And I started considering what
are the deeper ways that people

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:10%
can commune with star family?

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:10%
And I started going very deep
into the different cultures

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:10%
of the peoples that I
was connecting with,

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:10%
and asking the right
questions, and understanding

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:10%
not only their
cultures, but coming

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:10%
to understand how their cultures
have influenced and affected

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:10%
cultures here on
Earth for millennia.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And my work as a galactic
ambassador here on the planet

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:90%
really began.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What was your first step into
the galactic ambassadorhood?

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:10%
>> So after spending almost
a year, about nine months,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:10%
making contact, translating
codes from different star

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:10%
nations, calling in
ships for friends,

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:10%
and getting to know some of
these species a little bit

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:10%
better, it was time for there to
be another prayer run for world

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:10%
peace with indigenous
elders and youth.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:10%
This time, it would be a
run from Vancouver, British

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:10%
Columbia, all the way
up to Eklutna, Alaska.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And I found a friend.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
My friend Brittany
decides to come with me.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We borrow my friend Chris
Ardiana's hybrid Honda

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
to make the drive.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:90%
He rents it to us.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I headed out across the
country from Asheville again.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And this time, the
trip was different

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:90%
than any I'd ever taken.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Because everywhere
I went, I could

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:10%
see what needed to happen in
the infrastructure of the energy

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:10%
of the cities that I
was traveling through

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:10%
and begin to find myself
doing this work that involved

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:10%
organizing and correcting ley
line energies inside the planet

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.880 align:middle line:10%
in order to bring more
energy through the cities

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:10%
and clear blockages in the
fundamental ley line pipelines,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:10%
dragon lines, moving
through those cities

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:10%
to get people more
connected and more online.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:10%
And so as I started
to do that work

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:10%
in places like Los
Angeles and San Francisco,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:10%
and decoding the sort
of funk in the field

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and in the collective,
and accessing

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:10%
what are the keys needed
for people to move

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:10%
to the next phase
of their awakening,

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:10%
I also had this amazing
witness with me,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:10%
this young girl
who could give me

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:10%
this amazing feedback of
her experience of doing

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:10%
this great magic together.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And we traveled all the
way up to Vancouver.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
height of that work

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:84%
happened as we moved on
up into British Columbia.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:10%
And I found myself
at a gathering

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.000 align:middle line:10%
that was full of Syrian elves.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And here they all are incarnated
on this planet hanging out.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
party, a bunch of humans

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.530 align:middle line:84%
come in rolling
in with their kegs

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:90%
of beer and all their stuff.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:90%
And they're going in.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
They're changing the party.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're throwing
beer cans on the ground.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I see this tension of the
facing of this-- these people

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
who are naturally Earth
inclined and elven and connected

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to nature facing this
consciousness that's

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
just like, "Whatever.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else can
pick up my beer can."

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And I saw the clash.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:10%
And I had to find a
way to somehow connect

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:10%
to the energy of this
space at a deeper level

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:10%
than just facing
off with person one

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:10%
by one, to apply this knowledge
that I was gaining of clearing

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:10%
the blocks and ley lines
and bringing through greater

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:10%
energies in a city to how
a community can reconnect

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:10%
with each other.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I found at
this particular gathering

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
was to go and sit in
front of the fire,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and actually use
the fire as a center

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
point for the
energy of the field,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and listen and feel all of
the different pieces of what

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
would come up for people in the
space and up at the dance party

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and all around and just
constantly giving it back

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:90%
to the fire and letting it go.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that happened.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is happening.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And just loving, love, love,
love, non-freaking stop.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And Brittany joined me on
the other side of the fire.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And we just started pulsing
it together and building

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
this field that started to
change the circle of people

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:90%
around the fire.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The guys that were
just like kind

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:84%
of sitting in there smoking
with their beer cans

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
kind of started retreating
back and then fading.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And others started
coming in who wanted

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:90%
to sing songs or play music.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.490 align:middle line:10%
And the vibration
itself just started

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:10%
changing naturally by us doing
nothing or doing everything,

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:10%
but doing it with the higher
consciousness from a higher

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:10%
dimension, so to
speak, on what was

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:10%
happening instead of
trying to directly go

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:10%
at making the change.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And I applied the same
technique many times

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
over years after that
where I realized sometimes

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:84%
when you need something
to shift big time,

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
going straight at the problem is
not always the best way to go.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, it's better if
you can transcend the problem

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:10%
and understand it from a greater
perspective and point of view,

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:10%
and then literally uplift
the field to that place

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:10%
where that higher understanding
is already present.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:10%
And then everybody
just gets there.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:10%
The problem is transcended.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, and then did you
continue your journey up

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:90%
to Alaska?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We were interestingly
enough at this elven party

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
under Elphinstone
mountain, I discover.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Elphinstone mountain.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.785 align:middle line:90%
>> At a party that was in--

00:33:48.785 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's in Canada?

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's on
the Sunshine Coast.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --just off of Vancouver.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And the party that
I'm at, of course,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
it's called DNA for the
names of the three people

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:90%
that lived there.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And so here I am dealing with
the elven DNA and the human DNA

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
in this reconciliation at
a really deep level of care

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:90%
for the planet.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I go to catch
up with the prayer run.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Because after doing such
deep work in these cities,

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Brittany and I
had fallen behind.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And the kids had already
left from Vancouver.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're already
up into the Yukon.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we drove
up to catch them.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I did the run
the rest of the way

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:84%
into Alaska, fending
off the state bird

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
most of the way,
which is mosquitoes.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.879 align:middle line:84%
If you've never been to Alaska
in the summertime, boy, let me

00:34:37.879 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:90%
tell you.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of mosquitoes.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
And came to the World Peace
Prayer Day ceremonies.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
And arriving there, even
though I was still very young,

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I felt such a drastic
shift in the way

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:84%
that I would come to
that council and the way

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
that I'd hold space
there, not just as a youth

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
ambassador anymore, but as
an ambassador for the star

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:90%
nations.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And many of the indigenous
peoples that I encountered,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
including a Maori family,
could see that in me.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And they came to me and
want to connect with me.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we are
lighting up the Ring of Fire.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
We are taking our
sacred objects to all

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of these places in
the Ring of Fire

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
activating the Earth grid as
we know that you are doing.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And I heard stories
from many of the elders

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
about their histories.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:10%
And so much of their
sacred traditions

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:10%
were given to them in
communion with star nation all

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:10%
the way to the Lakota and
the white Buffalo calf

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:10%
woman who showed up
for these few men

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.030 align:middle line:10%
and basically gives them
the codes of the seven

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:10%
sacred ceremonies of
the Lakota people.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
and acknowledge her

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:84%
as star nation in
the most cases.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to really find
that the relationship with star

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
nation on this planet was
something that had been

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:90%
going on for a very long time.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get to know the
ancient cultural relationships

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:84%
with these nations better
as I got to know them better

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and had more contact experiences
and communion with them.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that sort of began me
on the next phase of my journey

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:23.420 align:middle line:84%
is to understand where and how
and why different star nations

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
came to this world and
where we could actually

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
find the keys of
their technologies

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and their cultures
in history itself.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, as a scientist,
I wanted the confirmation

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to prove
what I had experienced.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:10%
And of course, meeting so
many people that were also

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:10%
having memories from
other worlds, and also

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:10%
knew that they were from
these other planets,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:10%
and had had visions
and experiences

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:10%
started to give me
the confirmation

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:10%
that I needed about
their cultures,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:10%
about the way their
planets looked,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:10%
about the kinds of things
you'd find in their language

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:10%
and in their songs.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to do as
thorough of an investigation

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:10%
as I could so that
as the time passed,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:10%
I could bring a greater and
greater, clear and grounded

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:10%
understanding about our
community in the stars

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.202 align:middle line:10%
to humanity that I could.

00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:33.025 align:middle line:84%
So I feel we've just started
to open the can here.

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You have-- through
your experiences,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.310 align:middle line:90%
you've had contact.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You've had the ability to learn
about our star nations to--

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:90%
and I'd love to unpack that.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And I love to go into that more.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we're--
the sun is setting.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get on the road.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Can we revisit that in future
engagements here in a part 2,

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.190 align:middle line:90%
perhaps?

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Have me back and we'll focus
fully on star nation cultures--

00:38:02.912 --> 00:38:03.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:38:03.712 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --technologies and what's
happening on this planet

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:90%
and where we're going.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> To wrap up, just a quick
assessment where we are right

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.960 align:middle line:90%
2005, you got the downloads.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:90%
The cheers were there.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.515 align:middle line:84%
We know we're moving
in this direction.

00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
There was some
interference perhaps,

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe two years perhaps
of a little lull?

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> What's happening now?

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We just came from contact in the
desert, disclosure essentially,

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:90%
front page "Washington Post."

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:10%
We are in now a
postdisclosure world

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:10%
as far as our mainstream media
has now dropped that bomb.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
They've done it in the
past couple year we've

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.320 align:middle line:90%
been seeing the headlines.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But really, this past
two weeks has been

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:90%
just phenomenal for disclosure.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What's next?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.398 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to land?

00:38:56.398 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a process.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
cycles we've been in

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is about surfacing
all of the shadow.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
If we can't see our shadow, if
we can't see our challenges,

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:90%
then we can't change them.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And so while a lot of people
have lost a lot of hope

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:84%
in the past few
years about where

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going because so
much stuff is coming up,

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the reality is that stuff
has to come up for us

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see it, know it,
understand it, change it, heal

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
it, and grow from it,
and get somewhere better.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm very optimistic
about where we're at.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
In the field of
disclosure, as always,

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it's a minefield
of disinformation,

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a minefield of conflicting
testimonies and ideas.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And there will
always be people that

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.530 align:middle line:84%
tell stories just to get
themselves being recognized.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I've been dealing

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:90%
with for a very long time.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to
step in myself down

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way to focusing on
what's most important,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:84%
which is the science,
the technologies,

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the deep, personal, spiritual
experiences that I've had

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and that I can bring
and have with others

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and not focus on blasting it
out there to the world so much

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:84%
who I am or what I've
done because that's not

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
as important to me as
getting to where we're going.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So now I feel like with
all this stuff coming up

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and with my own life
going through a lot

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.980 align:middle line:84%
of transformations and
maturations in certain ways,

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel ready to share some of
these messages with the world.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a lot of others out there

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:90%
who have had experiences.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they've been afraid
to come forward with them.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they've felt like
nobody in their community

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:84%
will understand them
if they share it.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:90%
But I hope that changes.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the more we
all gain some context

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and some foundation
for what's to come,

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the easier time we're
going to have transitioning

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.830 align:middle line:90%
when the ships do land.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, something that you say
this fear of coming forward,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel you've had
the fear or have you?

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not been about fear
as much as it is about caution

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and being aware
that it's easy to--

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
when you have
fantastic experiences

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that other people maybe
haven't had to lose trust

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and to lose
connection with them.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't relate
with you as a normal human

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
being anymore.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've found
that telling people

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the stories of my personal
life transformations,

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and the pain I've gone through,
and the hard times I've

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:84%
been through gives them a
deeper sense that I am just

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
a kid that grew up in New Mexico
and used to hike and build

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:90%
forts in the woods.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And also, I've
come to understand

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a lot more than
that too, that I'm human,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also a
galactic ambassador.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people out there
are also not from this world

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And they know it.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
They've felt it for a long time.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot of
courage and a lot of movement

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:84%
through cycles and change and
transformations for people

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to accept that about themselves
and be willing to really own

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:90%
it and own who they are.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe a lot of them are
waiting for the right moment,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
maybe some fear, but maybe
just that awareness too like

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
yourself, knowing that you can't
push this information out there

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
ready to accept it.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So maybe we're--

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
with our headlines
this week, people

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:84%
are ready to accept
this information.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I think people are ready.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that also all
around this world, people

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.660 align:middle line:84%
are developing the technologies
and the systems that

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:84%
are going to get us
across this finish line.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, with my eyes, gravity
drives fully in development.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Not going to tell you where
they are or who's building them,

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:90%
but I've seen them.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen energy systems
running 24/7 just spinning

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.620 align:middle line:90%
on the vacuum.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And these projects in
science and in physics

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and in technology that
are happening right now

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.370 align:middle line:84%
are really the
force and the push

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that we need to crack through
the ceiling of is it possible

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that there's
extraterrestrials out there

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:84%
or not, or that even
these technologies are

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
possible, or are these
physics even possible?

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're going to
show the world that they are.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to build ships.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And just like Gene
Roddenberry showed us

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:84%
in his great vision of "Star
Trek," when you turn on warp

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:90%
drive, the Vulcans notice.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where we're going next.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Light up the ship
and head to the stars.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet, brother.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope we can all
head there together.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be on board the ship.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an honor
and pleasure, sir.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:90%
