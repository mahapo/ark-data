00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Jamie, welcome.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Or I should say welcome for
me to be here in Sedona.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, welcome to Sedona.

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> In your backyard.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
This amazing backdrop,
where we're just a stone's

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And lots of nature around us.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:90%
You live here.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been here for
about 10 years.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 years?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

fast-paced 10 years.

>> And do you have
any other titles?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a healer.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I do energy healing and
teach energy healing.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And I love teaching.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I teach a lot of
different things.

>> Energy healing, is
that the light language?

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I teach light language.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I teach a modality that I
created called crystalline soul

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I teach a lot
about ascension

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
so that people are learning how
to shift their consciousness

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.578 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate their awakening.

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> The awakening of the planet?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:10%
How did you come
about doing this?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What got you into it?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I just
became obsessed.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Obsessed?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I was not actually
a psychic child.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was probably around 17--

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
it was around 1987,
and I started having

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:90%
my first psychic experiences.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And my senses opened slowly,
over a period of time.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:10%
And then once I started
working with energy--

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:10%
and my non-physical guides are
the ones that first taught me

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:10%
how to work with energy--

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:10%
I just became obsessed.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating to me.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
That's all I wanted
to do, and it has

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:90%
continued to be an obsession.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said this started in
1987, the harmonic convergence?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't know
anything about it at the time.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was driving my car.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, when you're in
some kind of a rote activity,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you start to kind of slip
into a bit of an alpha state.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had what I thought was my
own thought pop into my head,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:90%
but it was very specific.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
was provable within about

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes that I could have
never just randomly thought of.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that someone I knew
from the past was going to be

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
at the location.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And that would happen
every once in a while.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And it would be just like that--

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:90%
something specific.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, it was this
person's going to be there,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it was someone
I hadn't seen in years.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I was going
to another state,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and I would get that message.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't control it.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But it was something
that was provable,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:90%
so I knew I could trust it.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And the message was simply
somebody was going to be there

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
It would be something direct
like that that was provable.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And it would just
happen occasionally.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, over the years,
it became more frequent.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And then around the mid-'90s--

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
which now, when I
look back at it,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
it was corresponding to the
comet that was passing through,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
was that Hayley's Comet.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You could even see
it in Los Angeles,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
where I was living at the time.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And it just stayed
there for a long time.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And right around that frame,
I noticed another big opening,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and I started seeing
people's auras.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I would have a lot
of interactions

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:90%
with ghosts from time to time.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
And I would see colors
connecting between people,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:10%
between different chakras.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what chakras were.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Around the late '90s,
I started having

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
things happen like I
would start to daydream,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:90%
what seemed like daydreaming.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I would zone out, and then I'd
kind of come back to awareness.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'd realize there was
a conversation going on

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in my head, and they
were odd things.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
One time, I remember
thinking, why

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
am I thinking about the healing
properties of the color green?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know chakras.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know healing energy.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that
information was starting

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to come into my awareness,
and that was my psychic senses

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
opening.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of appreciate that
there's all different ways

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that people experience
psychic phenomenon.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And since I wasn't
psychic before,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
it took me a lot
of my own awareness

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to discover what are
my psychic senses.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, wow,
that was a weird thought.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, oh, I
was getting communication

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:90%
much later.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they audible voices,
or how did they come through?

00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It would happen
in different ways.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:10%
Most of the time, it
would feel like it was

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:10%
my thought in the early days.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And now, it will be
everything from--

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm still very
clairaudient, but I

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
can sense that it's someone else
talking to me, like sometimes

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:90%
it's my guides.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it might be a client's
guides when I'm working,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
during a session.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And most times, I hear
it inside my head--

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:90%
every once in a while, outside.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe you could talk a
little bit about your guides

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.622 align:middle line:84%
and then the differences
between like a client's guides.

00:07:22.622 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And how do you tell
the difference?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Familiarity.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
All of my psychic
senses are open,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:90%
but they're not all my strength.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see my
guides, for instance.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I do have clairvoyance,
and I will see things,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not usually
seeing my guides

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
or seen other people's guides.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
For mine, it's more
the familiarity.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not someone that's
always trying to identify with

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
a name, so sometimes I get a
name, and sometimes I don't.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Areon, the Lyran
Council of Time that I channel,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with them for
a very long time as my guides

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
before I ever started
channeling them directly.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And then once I
started channeling

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.726 align:middle line:90%
them directly, and they--

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
they first identified themselves
as Lyran Council of Time.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they developed
the name Areon,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole other story.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But once I started
channeling them directly,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:90%
I recognized their information.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So I knew they had been working
with me for a long time.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.544 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's more the
information was familiar,

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to like a direct
voice or something like that?

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, or the
energy is familiar.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say the energy
is familiar, I'm just--

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.403 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're all going
through this convergence,

00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
this ascension,
and we're starting

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to become more in tune.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to
feel different energies,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't really been
able to differentiate

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
or been able to tell who and
what is what, like names.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you get a clear
name, then it's easy.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:90%
But how do you feel it?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think it's important
to learn how your senses work,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
like what are the
reference points,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and what are some of
the stronger senses?

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, because I
don't see my guides,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I rely on other senses.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
intuitive senses,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.633 align:middle line:90%
and it's all very natural to us.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the clairs, like
clairsentient, clairaudient?

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, clairsentience,
the feeling.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Clairvoyance, clairaudience, the
smell and taste, all of that.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the emotions are
also part of our senses,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:90%
like clairempathy.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And with guides, since my vision
isn't strong in seeing them,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I will either ask questions,
like if there's a name.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Or some people might see colors
or might see faces or things

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
They might have a
reference point.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone was working
with Archangel Michael,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and they might see
that reference point.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So, in essence, this
is an important part

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
of our ascension.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, ascension is
a shift in consciousness.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And what that is, is more
of a conscious connection

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:90%
with the subtle realms.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:84%
We've always been
interacting with them.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But now we're more consciously
interacting with them.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So as you learn to discern
that subtle information--

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's all the
clair senses are,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is helping to give you more
clarity and more detail

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
into the information
that's not as obvious.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So you have reference points.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn how to
sense those references,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
you're starting to open up
more of that communication.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So having a reference
point-- what would, say,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
someone with a Archangel
Michael reference point,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:90%
what would you--

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it could be different
for different people.

00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And maybe a better example
that my guides use sometimes--

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:10%
the "Animal-Speak"
book by Ted Andrews.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I'll get a vision
of an animal in my head.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:10%
And if I go and read that book,
then something will stand out.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's one that
I already know about

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:90%
because I've read it before.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll show me a
picture of that animal,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's a way of interpreting
a layer of information.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really
individualistic, how they work,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has their
own reference points based

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on their experiences
and that kind of thing?

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And so then you're
learning how to read

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
more deeply into the
information that's around you.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what helps you become
clearer within and understand

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
things in a deeper way.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And when you work with the--

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:84%
what was the other modality
you said, working with the--

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystalline soul healing?

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.755 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that a
little bit and how it works?

00:12:10.755 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I didn't start
out to create a modality.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It just started
happening kind of,

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
because I might be a
little anal retentive.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You're really listening
to those reference points.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
When I started doing
energy healing,

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know how can I
best help people in that frame

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%
that I have them.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
making these lists

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
of just foundational things
that I wanted to cover.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And my guides were working
with me through that

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and helping to compile
that information.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I ended up
discovering along the way

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
is that was actually
my Lyran guides

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're working with me that
hadn't identified themselves

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
But I was creating a template.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an alchemical template that
works through your high herself

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to help you release and activate
in that moment around whatever

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
topic you're wanting to work on.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's a Lyran way of working,
to use those templates,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.728 align:middle line:84%
almost like running a
virus scan on a computer.

00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It's running in the background.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.353 align:middle line:90%
It's looking for certain things.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
If it has it, then it changes.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It if it doesn't, it leaves it.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
If it's appropriate
for your path,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
your higher self will help
you release or activate.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So once that was
completing, I used

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.798 align:middle line:84%
to go through the entire
thing, the whole way.

00:13:47.798 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
I guess I'm just

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
going to have to schedule
multiple sessions.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And one day, I got a
very clear message--

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:10%
you no longer have to do the
whole thing individually.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:90%
It just all happens at once.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was practicing
with friends at the time.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And my friend came the
next day, because we

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
were scheduled to practice,
and she said, hey,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:90%
I got a message for you.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
exact same message.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:10%
So that modality originated
from my Lyran guides

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:10%
that now is Areon, the
Lyran Council of Time.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So you brought up Lyran.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
That name has popped up in
my series here and there,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
but could you go
into more detail

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
about who are the Lyrans?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What are the Lyrans, and
what's your connection

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:90%
to that, to that race?

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So, from the best
of my knowledge,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
they are the origination of what
we are culminating here with

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So they are ancient
forefathers, foremothers, and--

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So original humans.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Like this form?

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> The original physical form.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Not that they were just like us.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They're often associated
with the felines.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
They are really starting to
come more into our awareness.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it's
because we're getting

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
kind of deeper into ourselves.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We're just connecting
more deeply.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
a surprise to me.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting
a Lyran connection.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:10%
And in the early
2000s, I was going

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:10%
to have a session with someone.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And like a day or so
before the session,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I just got this very clear
message, I'm a Lyran.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.872 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, well, OK.

00:15:36.872 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> From them or--

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> From me.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, from me.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I didn't-- you
know, from psychically.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.795 align:middle line:84%
>> You were working
with somebody else?

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just randomly
doing nothing,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and I got that message.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, two days later,
when I had the session,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things she
said was, oh, you're a Lyran.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Great validation.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And what did that feel like?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I had no reference
for it at the time.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
At the time, she
said the Lyrans--

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
she said many other
things, but she

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
said the Lyrans were
the template builders.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:90%
And that meant nothing to me.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what that meant.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until a
couple of years later,

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:10%
when I ended up creating
crystalline soul healing,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:10%
that I'm like, oh, my
gosh, I created a template.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what a
template was or how to do it.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So the pieces kind
of fell into place.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And I like that.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I find that that
happens a lot, that

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
best laid plans are wonderful,
but so much of it we

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:90%
have to discover along the way.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And even kind of referencing
back to psychic senses,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I find that, often, there's
an expectation that, oh, well,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
if you're psychic, then you
can access all information.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's not what I find.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I find that you access the
appropriate information.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is to be
experienced and discovered,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's perfect.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is a typical session?

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If someone wanted to
have a session with you,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:90%
how would that go?

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Do they get the coding that
you worked with, or is it--

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So crystalline soul healing
is a silent modality.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of what I call
our new paradigm of healing,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
where it's all about empowerment
and your higher self.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Your unique, subtle self is
really doing most of the work.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So the human will
make some choices,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
but that higher
self is deciding,

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
on an unconscious level, what
you'll release and activate.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm generally
talking to people

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
about what they want to work
on, what kinds of things

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
they want to change
in their life.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And once I discover, through
that bit of conversation,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
what has energy on it, any
guidance that's coming through

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that,
at a certain point--

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
even though healing is
happening the whole time--

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
then I'll run the frequencies
in a concentrated way.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Mainly so I can get
the information,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
or they can get any
information, about what's

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
releasing or activating.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I happened to do light
language alongside of that,

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
but they're two completely
separate modalities.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can just do
one and not the other.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So please explain,
what is light language?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So light language
is something that's

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:90%
actually very natural to us.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It's actually just a
unique form of channeling.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you're channeling
light language,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you are accessing
information or a language

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that the channel does
not consciously know.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
technical terms for it

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
that are more Western based that
cover glossolalia, which is--

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Say that again.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Glossolalia is a
language that's, of course,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:90%
unknown to the channeler.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a language
that's not known on Earth.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So it might be something
that's galactic,

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
or it could be something that
is an ancient Earth language

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:90%
or a future Earth language.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
xenoglossia, which

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, also
unknown to the channeler,

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's a language
that is known on Earth.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, like an
ancient language.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Or like something that
the channeler doesn't know.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> French?

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Like French.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I've had two instances,
one where someone told me

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I spoke a phrase in Hebrew
and another time in Japanese.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Where, of course, you know
you have to say enough so that

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a random word,
because that could happen

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:90%
by chance.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have to have somebody
there that knows the language

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
tell you, confirm that.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually heard about
xenoglossia yesterday

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.842 align:middle line:90%
and looked it up on Wikipedia.

00:19:58.842 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, that's a thing.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, is that the same
as speaking in tongues?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, ultimately, the
same as speaking in tongues.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talk
about it like if we

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
had like different
forms of dance,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
you might have modern dance
or ballet or hip hop dance.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
They're all dance, but there's
some differences between them.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And from what my guides have
taught me, it's the same thing,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
but we started taking it outside
of the context of religion.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we're able to expand
into other things that--

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
other frequency bandwidth
that we might have access to.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> How does this work?

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Is light language, is it--
if somebody just doesn't know

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:90%
French, for example--

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
put it in this context
that everybody knows--

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly starts
speaking French,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
this sort of proves,
maybe, a Rupert Sheldrake's

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:90%
morphogenetic field type idea.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Or is it like a collective
type idea of information

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
that we can tap into?

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you see it?

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, light
language is basically

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
what I would call a nonlinear
form of communication.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Our languages, we
learn by memorization,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and then we start to apply
context, personal context

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and agreed-upon context.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But we also know
we're only using

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
a small portion of
our brain in ways

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:90%
that our science can identify.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have the capability
to do light language

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to learn multiple languages.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
instances of people

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that have had accidents
that then start

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.513 align:middle line:90%
speaking another language.

00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:52.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah, I've
heard about that.

00:21:52.097 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And they didn't know it
before, and then suddenly,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:84%
they're fluent in
French, for example.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes head injuries
and things like this.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.262 align:middle line:84%
Different parts of the
brain get activated.

00:22:00.262 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is happening much
more now with light language.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
channeling light language,

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:84%
you are accessing a
different part of the brain

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
than you do when you're using
your memorized contextual

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a capability
that we already have.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of tuning into it.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:90%
The same as channeling.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
are all channels.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
We are all receiving
information,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're all
emitting information.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We're all taking
things that are subtle,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
like ideas and concepts, and
then we bring them either

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
into words, which is more
linear or more dense,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:90%
more direct, or form.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so light language
is similar to that,

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
where you're accessing this
vast, nonlinear information.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it may come through
in sound or something visual,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:90%
like signing or written.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But you're accessing that
vast, subtle information,

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and then you're bringing
it more specific.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So I often relate it to the
metaphor of the double slit

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
experiment, where when that wave
form is being observed, then

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:90%
it starts to show particle form.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I experience
the light language.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:84%
When I bring through
a transmission,

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
it's in what I would
call wave form.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Its vast.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It's nonlinear.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of undefined.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, as it interacts
with us, with our density,

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
with our higher self, then
it becomes particle form,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:90%
or it gets specific for you.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes people will
be having a unique experience

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
within that transmission because
it's their own reference point.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are some of the
responses you've heard when

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.687 align:middle line:84%
people hear light
language in a session.

00:23:54.687 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you do private sessions
with that, or group sessions?

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I do private sessions with it.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I do group teleclasses, and
we do a video every month.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I hear most often is
either, it felt so familiar,

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
it sounded familiar, or they
start crying spontaneously.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it stirs
up that memory.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's something that speaks
directly to the heart,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of bypasses
those mental constructs

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not bound
by our mental limitations.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, often, tears
come, because there's

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that heart recognition.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
So language of the heart, maybe.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, the heart, or our
emotions, are vast information,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:90%
and we define it.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sad.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this
flow of information.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is our
engine of connection.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It's how we connect
out, and that

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
creates that sense of vastness
and infinite and connection

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
between things that
seemed separate.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, a lot
of times, there's

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:90%
a heart response or tears.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Can you compare to
the other modality

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that you were doing
with this body--

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.397 align:middle line:90%
this full chakra?

00:25:25.397 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> The crystalline soul healing.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Sorry, crystalline--
how do you say it?

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul healing.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul healing.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:90%
So how would you compare--

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
or what are the differences
between the light language

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
modality and the crystalline
soul healing modality?

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the big
differences is crystalline soul

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:84%
healing is silent,
and of course,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
light language is
visible or audible.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But the crystalline soul
healing is a template that is

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
going through a
series of checks,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:84%
either for certain beliefs or
trauma or teaching a deeper

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
understanding of an
emotion or a situation.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you do that
if it's silent, though?

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Because of the intent.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Our intent is what
is most powerful.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.717 align:middle line:84%
And even kind of like if
someone was to say, I love you,

00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that's
really important

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:90%
is what is their intent.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Those are just words.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But the intent is
where the real power is.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And when that template was
developing, what I was doing

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
was creating that access to
that flow of information.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And then once someone has the
intent to heal something--

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and the healer is
just there, honestly,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
just observing and
allowing for that space

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to be held as that person
does that that work.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the intent that is
creating the healing.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And light language is similar
in that it's vast information,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it's becoming
more specific.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're, ultimately, two
completely separate modalities,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:90%
and they just go well together.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And light language goes
well with many other things,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and so does crystalline
soul healing.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So like a
Buddhist meditation,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
when you sort of put in a
prayer of sorts, with the--

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or you request a healing
from a Buddhist meditator,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they sort of meditate
or give prayers, in that sense?

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Similar to that, yeah.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even the reference of
the virus scan on a computer.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:90%
You're doing diagnostics.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.883 align:middle line:84%
It is the intent that starts
running that diagnostic tool.

00:27:48.883 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what crystalline
soul healing is like.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're working with,
that person you're working with,

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:90%
their guides to move that along?

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.895 align:middle line:84%
The human, the higher
self, and the guides.

00:27:58.895 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my guides
are always there, as well.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So all three of those aspects
to then identify and release

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
the traumas, the tensions,
whatever the intent is for that

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:90%
person?

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So rather than the
healer choosing

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
what's going to change or
not, it is the higher self.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the guides that are
utilizing that information

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
flow from the crystalline
soul healing template.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the person will have
the healing from that intent,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
of their intent wanting
to heal and then

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the healer's intent activating
that diagnostic tool.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> With light
language, it's verbal.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:90%
There's sound coming out.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And how would that go into--

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
you said earlier, it
opens people's hearts,

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and it gets energy
and connections--

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:84%
energy moving and people
reconnecting to their heart

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Anything else you want to add?

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:84%
What I find is
it's like bringing

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
through a library
of information.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's multiple
things that that information

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
is teaching them
on a cellular level

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:84%
or on a spiritual level or
emotional or mental level.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as
our linear languages.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like a flow of information.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, as that responds
with their body, their history,

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
their energetics, it's helping
them to shift and expand

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
in ways that if they were
just using the mental mind,

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
it would be just a
little bit slower.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Or a lot slower.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are people
who are listening to it.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed there's
a huge increase of people

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
who are actually doing
the light language.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you teach that, as well?

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So it started happening
to me in the early 2000s.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And back in that time--

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about this in my book--

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
my guides would-- I was used to
having conversations with them

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:90%
during the healing process.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell
me, usually, what

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:90%
was going on with the person.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And my hands started
moving around,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because they first started
signing through me.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And my guides
sometimes would give me

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
this cryptic answer, like
there's this many people

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:90%
on Earth that do this.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.173 align:middle line:84%
And the number was
small, and it would

00:30:22.173 --> 00:30:25.060 align:middle line:90%
go up and down rather rapidly.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And I would ask, do what?

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't give
me the whole story,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because I was meant
to discover part of it

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and, ultimately, to choose.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
took me a long time

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
to actually come out with this.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.423 align:middle line:84%
I kept it suppressed
for a really long time.

00:30:40.423 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Doing the light language?

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing the light language.

00:30:42.757 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess it could be
kind of embarrassing.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I was so scared.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, my
gosh, my whole life

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:90%
is going to be different.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a freak.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.402 align:middle line:84%
>> What are people
going to think about me?

00:30:53.402 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> People are going to judge me.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I
found out, of course,

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:90%
it was me judging me most.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> As it always is.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't change
it for the world.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I do get some
negative comments and things

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
from people that understand
it, and I don't take

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:90%
on their negative comments.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:10%
But once I started
letting it flow,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:10%
it was such a powerful
and sacred experience--

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:10%
I feel like it expands
my understanding--

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:10%
that I made that choice to
share it and no longer hide it.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So in about 2012 or 2013,
somewhere around there--

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:84%
2013-- my guides started telling
me, we want you to teach it.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And they spent a year and a half
preparing me and teaching me

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:90%
how to teach it to others.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it's
something that anyone can do.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need to learn
it from me, because it's just

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:90%
a unique form of channeling.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people it happens naturally
to, like it did for me.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But I love nurturing people
through that journey,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:90%
because it's unusual.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It can be confusing and scary.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get to
open up in a community,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:90%
it is just magical.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely love it.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I do teach people how to
start to access light language.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> So I guess it goes both
ways, because if you're on the

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:10%
receiving end, then you have
to allow whoever is doing

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:10%
the light language,
without judgment,

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:10%
to let it come through
and then receive it.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing it, then,
again, the self-judgment part,

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to sort of get
past your own self-judgments

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and let it come through.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So just in those two, the
giving and the receiving parts,

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems like there has to
be a big allowance, right,

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:90%
for both sides.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that's even part--

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there's
vibrational frequencies

00:33:00.683 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:90%
attached and all this stuff.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But even if you got
rid of all of that

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't have any--

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:84%
it was just simply
this allowance

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to just say whatever
for both sides, right?

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Just that in itself seems
like a healing modality.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I have gotten the
question sometimes,

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.022 align:middle line:84%
like, why does it have to
come through like that?

00:33:20.022 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Why can't it just be silent
and do the same thing?

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's many
valid reasons for why

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:84%
it comes through
either verbally,

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:90%
or it might be written.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of helping
to expand our consciousness

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and our deeper understanding
of some of our capabilities

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:90%
that are natural to us.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And even kind of
getting past some

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the fears and the
judgments that we have

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:90%
or things that we consider odd.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, weird is
kind of the new normal.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Yup, yup.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think there's layers of
value to the whole journey with

00:33:58.910 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
love that, often,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:84%
what I hear from people
is, it felt familiar.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I felt something in my
body, or I felt an emotion.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a strong
sensory sense system for us.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's starting to show us
something's happening there.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
I may not be able to define
it, like I can define languages

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that I know, but I can
start to have evidence

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:90%
that something's happening.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an
important part for some people.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
The first time that I
ever shared this publicly,

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
someone came up
to me afterwards.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole long story.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
But someone came up to
me afterwards and said,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that
it comes through you.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a storm.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I get to see that
something happened.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And that made an impact on me.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt more comfortable
allowing that weirdness,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because there was
perfect reason to it.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess we
are physical beings.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:84%
We use language as probably the
main modality of communication.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we use
reading and writing

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and visual stuff, but
verbal speaking is like--

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.410 align:middle line:90%
that's how we communicate.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So to make that jump straight
into telepathic communication,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe this is a
bridge of some sort.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It is helping us to
discern a broader

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
system of understanding.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
what I do when I help--

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
when I teach people how to do
light language in the class.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is
helping them to learn

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
how to discern in deeper ways,
not just the verbal references

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that we memorize,
which are valuable.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We're still going to be using
those for quite a while.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But it helps to bridge
that gap between just complete

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
telecommunication,
telepathic communication.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because so many times
in our day-to-day language,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:84%
communications and stuff,
there's so many multiple

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:90%
meanings or layers.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people can say one
thing but mean another thing

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:90%
and use that in malevolent ways.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
They're being
manipulative as far

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:33.340 align:middle line:90%
as trying to coerce someone.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So I guess you're
saying teach discernment

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:84%
so people can then feel,
behind the words, the intent.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>> And then become--

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:10%
and make more true decisions for
themselves, sort of, in a way,

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:10%
guiding them along.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Connecting to our
intuitiveness, right?

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one of
those layers of benefit to it,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
because that discernment is a
big part of our empowerment.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that
clear discernment and trust

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, it is so much
easier to tune in subtle things

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and make better choices.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the light language
come from the Lyrans?

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not necessarily.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
When someone accesses
light language,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll be accessing
things that are

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:90%
unique to their soul signature.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, beyond that,
they'll start accessing things

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
that may not necessarily
be so directly

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
connected to their
soul signature,

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:40.900 align:middle line:84%
like maybe if they're
working with someone else,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.030 align:middle line:84%
they'll be connecting
more with their guides

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:90%
or their languages.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say soul signature,
is that like their star family?

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Their star family, yeah.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even past lives that
they've had here, ancient--

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient wisdom or
higher self kind of thing?

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So each person has
their own light language?

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> To a certain extent.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> To a certain degree.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you've been
around them enough,

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
you start to hear
certain languages that--

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
a situation where

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I was working with my
soul sister, who also does

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:84%
light language-- and we
found each other early

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:90%
on in our opening journeys.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And she would do this
language that I never did,

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and it sounded so weird.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I met someone else
from another country

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.140 align:middle line:90%
that she had never met.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
The internet was not
big at that time.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:90%
There was no YouTube.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke
the same language.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Never came out of me, but
it came out of those two,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:90%
and so I recognized it right.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And multiple
situations like that,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but that was one
before there was

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:90%
a lot of availability for it.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've been hearing
it off and on for a couple

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of years now.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed some of
them do sound quite similar.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, has there been
anybody that actually has taken

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
them and analyzed them as
a structured language kind

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
of thing?

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Not as a structured
language, that I'm aware of.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There are some
languages that are

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.150 align:middle line:90%
more translatable than others.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I find that
I get a lot of information.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I find
I get just a gist.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty rare I get
absolutely nothing,

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:90%
but that can happen.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And translating was
a skill that I always

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
had early on when
light language started

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.950 align:middle line:84%
opening up-- not at the
very, very beginning,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:90%
but it was definitely there.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Translating yours or others?

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.588 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I worked
with someone where

00:39:45.588 --> 00:39:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I would translate
his light language,

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.005 align:middle line:84%
because he couldn't
translate it at the time.

00:39:49.005 --> 00:39:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, over time, his
translating opened up.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So what I find is there are ones
that are more familiar to us.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we may have the
capability to translate them.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot of situations--

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe not a lot,
but I've definitely

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
had enough situations where
someone else was getting

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:84%
a translation and I was
getting a translation,

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and we could confirm it.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the same as reading
a book that's already written

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and all the words are exact.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like enough
clarity that you

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.480 align:middle line:84%
can reference that that
person is getting something

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
unusual enough,
and this person is

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:84%
getting something
that is extremely

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.660 align:middle line:84%
similar and unusual
enough that you can

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:90%
confirm that it's translatable.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But not everything
is like that, or not

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
everyone has the capability
to translate every language.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, what we're accessing
are things that are more

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.980 align:middle line:90%
familiar to their energetics.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I get a
lot of Syrian languages,

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Pleiadian
that's mixed with Lyran,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.850 align:middle line:84%
things that are referenced from
ancient Egyptian languages.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Those tend to come
through me a lot.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There was an
experience that I had,

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:84%
because I channel Areon in
English and they're Lyran.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I would channel them in
English, and then I would stop,

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and then I would do some
light language after it.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
Areon in the light language.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's different energies.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was one time
when I was channeling,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.070 align:middle line:84%
during the channeling,
Areon said,

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to speak to you
in our original language.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I began speaking
light language.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was more
difficult of a flow

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
than was typical for me,
because it's not necessarily

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.990 align:middle line:84%
a closer resonance that
I'm accessing all the time

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:90%
in light language.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's a flow that
will be more natural,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and yet, you can access
things that aren't necessarily

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:84%
directly connected to you in
this human reference point.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned
Pleiadian and Syrian.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
would be something

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:84%
you're more a closer match
to than the Lyran language

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.260 align:middle line:90%
in itself?

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's
closer to our DNA.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe our DNA is
Pleiadian and Syrian mostly,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and so it's a little
closer reference for us.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I look forward to getting
into some channeling and light

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:84%
language tomorrow and exploring
and receiving and connecting

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:90%
to some of those energies.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything final you'd like
to share with us before we jump

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:90%
into that?

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of the
things that I love about light

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
language is that
it seems so odd,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
very natural to us.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, is a big
part of the whole message

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
of ascension, is it's
very natural to us.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of expanding
into things that might

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:90%
seem a little unusual at first.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.070 align:middle line:90%
