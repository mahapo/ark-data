00:00:02.994 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I really truly
see this advancement.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:10%
I see hybrids coming
to the planet.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I see us developing,
growing, ascending,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
moving into this new
vibrational plane of existence,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
creating a new dynamic
on this planet.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it sounds
like a really big task,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but I think that we're going
to have a huge upheaval,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's all for the
better of humanity.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
It's all for the ascension
and the conscious evolution

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.604 align:middle line:90%
of the collective.

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
We are on the right track.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems really
chaotic right now,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be this way so
that we can collapse the old

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.608 align:middle line:90%
in order to enter into the new.

00:01:21.608 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me check these over here.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of interviewers or
radio show hosts or whatever

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:10%
are like, wow, that was the
easiest interview I've ever had

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:10%
because there's just
so much information.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Just go, yeah.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:90%
You can just go.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You can bring up unicorns,
and I've got something to talk

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:90%
about, you know?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> There's so much to cover.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We could do this for
a day and probably--

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, I know.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.375 align:middle line:90%
There'd still be so--

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, a Livestream
marathon and never fully--

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We should do that.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> --never fully get all the
concepts we want to get across.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you ready?

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.985 align:middle line:84%
Waiting for Steve
to get in position.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Looking good, looking good.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Good to go?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome, Elizabeth April.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming
on and doing this.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:90%
You have many titles--

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, channel,
psychic, medium, artist,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.948 align:middle line:90%
quantum researcher.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
What else do you
want to add to that?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Paradigm shifter.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:90%
I like that one.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Paradigm shifter.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> When did this all happen?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:90%
When did this start for you?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, really childhood.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not necessarily a
third-generation psychic

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, but
I was born with clairvoyant

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and extrasensory abilities.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So I had the ability to see
auras and chakras and energies

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:90%
at a young age.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing ghosts
and spirits, talking

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
to interdimensional
beings, even though I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:84%
thought they were imaginary
friends and those kind

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely started
at a very young age,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
which I feel so happy
about because it's

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
been a lifetime of
balancing those abilities.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there one moment,
one specific event,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.283 align:middle line:84%
that stuck out to trigger
the start of this or--

00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my parents told me that
around the age of two years old

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
they kind of knew
that I was different,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
even though I had a brother
who was a year older than me.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So there was definitely
that kind of comparison of I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
would follow things
in the room and I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
would be talking to
things in my room

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that obviously
they couldn't see.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember at the age
of around five or six,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I went up to my dad.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised Catholic, so I
went to church and all of that.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to my
dad, and I said, Dad,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:90%
the Bible has it wrong.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
The church is wrong.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And he says, OK, tell me.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Enlighten me.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the Bible
tells us that God is a man,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and I've been talking to
God, and God's a female.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:90%
God's a woman.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, in
the Catholic religion,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
they tell you that if you're
talking to something that no

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
one else can see it's
either demons or it's God.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it obviously was
a really pleasant experience

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and a really lovely individual
that I was talking to,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was a female, so I
just assumed that it was God

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.132 align:middle line:90%
and everyone else had it wrong.

00:05:27.132 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So that was definitely
a moment that stuck out.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And my dad would always take
out the cassette recorder.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So he would always interview
us and get us on recording,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that that's on
some sort of cassette tape

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
somewhere probably
in the basement.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, looking back, do you
recognize what that energy was?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what, I've never
really tuned into that energy

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in particular, but I had a
lot of imaginary friends.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I had a very wide imagination
and a lot of excitement

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:90%
as a kid, as well.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that, around
the age of eight years old--

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
this was after my
parents divorced--

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I was over at my mom's
house, and we just moved.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So she separated and
moved to another place.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this new place, there
was spirits and energies

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:90%
running rampant.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I would tell
her all the spirits

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that I was seeing and
talking to and what happened,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.347 align:middle line:84%
and one of them happened to
be a little girl my age and--

00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> How old were you at the time?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I was around eight.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out
there was a murder that

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:90%
happened in that home--

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.722 align:middle line:84%
>> --not too long before
we moved in there and--

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What part of the world
was this where you grew up?

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> This was in
Canada, yeah, Ontario.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:90%
And so-- yeah.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.187 align:middle line:84%
And so I would make friends
with this little girl.

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of freaked out.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But my mom told me, when I was
explaining all these ghosts

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and spirits that I was talking
to, or beings or people

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I kind
of described them

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
as, she said, oh,
you've just been

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:90%
watching too many scary movies.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not actually happening.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And for me at eight to
have all these experiences

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and then to have that
be so downplayed,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, all right,
then I'm making this up.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- it's
not happening.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you put a
lot of weight and--

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
You put a lot of weight into
your elders and obviously

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
people of authority, your
teachers and your parents,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and so what they say goes.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And if my mom
thought that it was

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was watching too many
scary movies because she was

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
scared herself,
then, of course, that

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the start of me
shutting down my abilities.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And when did
they start coming--

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
when we were allowed to--

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
or when did you tell yourself
you could let them out?

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was also another issue
that happened in childhood, as

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:84%
well, which was I'd go
over to my friend's house

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and I would see their
grandfather who passed away

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
five years earlier,
and I'd be like,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:90%
oh, your grandpa, he's here.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:07.902 align:middle line:90%
That's really nice.

00:08:07.902 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
what do you mean?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Grandpa passed away.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:90%
And I be like, oh.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
the kids at school,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:84%
elementary school,
started to bully me,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and the main thing that I was
bullied on was you're a liar.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
You're making this all up.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.563 align:middle line:90%
You just want attention.

00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because a lot

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
of the trolls, the
individuals on my channels

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.358 align:middle line:90%
these days, say the same thing.

00:08:30.358 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're just making
this all up for attention.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
And so it's tough
to be in a field

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having all of these
experiences all the time,

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
and it's very difficult to, say,
prove in the physical world.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So I still am confronted
with those kind of energies

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:84%
of you're just lying,
you're just making it up,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and you just can't
let that get to you.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I mean, these
experiences are very real,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
very validated

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
by many tens of
thousands of people

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
all over the world who are
having very similar experiences

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
completely unrelated to me.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How does it feel
now to be validated?

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels really good.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Spirits and energies, it's an
easy validation, but aliens

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and other dimensions a
little bit more tricky.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But with today's quantum
physics and the science that's

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
coming out and the research, I
feel really validated in what's

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:90%
being exposed at this time.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What about when other
people have similar alien-type

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Does that feel
like a validation?

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Super validating and
sometimes disheartening

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of individuals
tend to have very similar

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
experiences to me in an
interdimensional way,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and they will be very
fear based about it.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:90%
So the experience is the same.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The perception is
very different.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And so my heart goes
out to those people that

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.310 align:middle line:84%
are very fearful of
what's happening to them,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I could
talk to everyone

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
having an alien or
interdimensional experience

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and say, it's OK.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%
This is all for the best.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
thing that I found

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is that if I go to a conference
and I'm a speaker or what

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
have you at some of
these alien conferences,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the people would
be like, aren't you scared?

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Like, what-- you know?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I say, ultimately, you've
had a very fear-based abduction

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
experience, but do
you feel like you're

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
more awakened, more aware,
more enlightened because of it?

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And every single
time they'll say yes.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
So it changes a person, yes.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's a lot of fear
there from coming from the ego.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:90%
But ultimately it wakes you up.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's incredible.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When you go to
these conferences,

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
what is your demographic?

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's really cool.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have done sessions
for people all over the world.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So in one day, I'll have
clients from Guatemala, Germany,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Australia, UK, US, all over the
place, which is so incredible.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Demographic wise, people
who watch my content, it's

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
pretty 50/50 as far as males
and females, which I think

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is pretty cool, and
it's usually between,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I think, around the
age of 25 to 45 mainly.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:10%
But it's really cool.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I've done individuals who are
85 all the way to children

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
who are 8, 9, 10 years older.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's usually
obviously their parents who are

00:11:24.665 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
getting the session for them
because of these beautiful

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
little star seed children who
just need a little bit of that

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
help, a little bit of
that validation-- so yeah,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:90%
really all across the board.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.097 align:middle line:10%
>> What is a typical session
like if I were to call you up

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:10%
and, hey, I want to
have this session?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:10%
Because your form of
channeling, from what

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:10%
we've talked about
before, is a little bit

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:10%
different than what's usually
in the show and stuff.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:10%
>> How does that
work if I call you?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So a typical session,
it's about an hour long,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go through a
little bit of everything.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So what I like to do--

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it a
DNA activation session.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So what does your soul
need to know at this time

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to get you to the
next level, to get you

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:84%
as aligned and harmonious to
your path, your purpose as

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:90%
possible?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So usually that comes down
to me scanning your aura,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:90%
your chakras, your energy.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The kind of channeling that I
do is very visual, extremely

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
visual, and sometimes
it's very difficult

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to take a visual
representation of information

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and put it into,
translate it into, words.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I try the
best that I can.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'll do a little chakra scan.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.486 align:middle line:90%
I'll look at someone's aura.

00:12:36.486 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And you say visual, but
you're doing this remotely--

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
so usually by Skype
or some other--

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
so how do you visually
remotely do this?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
What happens there
when you visually meet?

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.263 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really cool.

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So scanning someone's aura,
chakra, their consciousness,

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
their soul, I mean, that can
be done anywhere in the world,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and I do a lot of
remote viewing,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:90%
a lot of astral traveling.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So I will also travel
all over the universe

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:90%
into other dimensions.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So space and time, when I'm
in that place of channeling,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.777 align:middle line:90%
it really doesn't exist.

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And you do that in real
time while you're doing

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:90%
the sessions?

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.575 align:middle line:84%
>> I do that in real time
while I'm doing the sessions.

00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:14.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, OK.

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'll tune into
someone's energy.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the time,
I'll say, hey,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a big energy
build-up somewhere.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the elbow.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the knee.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Obviously my client usually
validates me on, wow,

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I've had an injury there.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I've had an issue with
that for a very long time.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll scan their chakras.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You're working on your solar
plexus, your confidence

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:90%
But you have to speak up.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Your throat chakra's a
little bit imbalanced.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we dive even deeper
into those imbalances.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Where is that habit pattern?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Where is that trauma?

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Where is that block coming
from in this lifetime?

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Usually I'll go back
into their childhood.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Hey, was your mom like
this, and were there

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:90%
a lot of expectations on you?

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Validation, validation.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we go even deeper, and
we go into some past lifetimes.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going on
over and over as a repeated

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:90%
cycle in this lifetime.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Where has this been,
and where did this

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:90%
get started in past lifetimes?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So usually, if it's
an issue with the mom

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
or if it's an
injury in the knee,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that injury or that
issue or that trauma

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
has been reoccurring in
lifetime after lifetime.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's not good to just go
into all of the lifetimes

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
where it's been reoccurring
and it's obvious.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to go back to
the initiating trauma.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
What was that one lifetime
where this cycle got started?

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, once we go
into that past lifetime,

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
it automatically clears the
karmic energy of that life.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Once we do a lot of the old
energy, the old cycle work--

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say go into it, just
by describing it, just by re--

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'll-- yeah.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --re-living it through words.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Reliving it through words.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it bring--

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'll see it visually.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.797 align:middle line:90%
I'll see all of it.

00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you a good example.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Just the other day,
just last week,

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I went into this
first-time client.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
She was very skeptical.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
She's never seen
a psychic before.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this past life,
and it was in the kind of--

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:90%
what is it-- like, mid-1400s--

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:90%
so Dark Ages, medieval era.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was just her and her mom.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And her mom-- the
only word that I

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
could define it was a smuggler.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:90%
She was a smuggler.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So she would take
stolen goods, usually

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
very precious stolen
goods back in the 1400s,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and so she would
take these goods,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.015 align:middle line:84%
and then she would
sell them to buyers.

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So she was kind
of the middleman.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
She didn't do the
stealing, but she

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:90%
was the middleman in between.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> The pawn shop.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And so she ended up
getting caught and put

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
into jail for just six
months, this medieval jail.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And so her mom started freaking
out and told her daughter.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter was 15.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this is my client now,
the daughter in this past life.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.438 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the mom said, hey, you
have to break me out of jail.

00:15:58.438 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You have to get me out of here.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep my
business running.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So the mother had really no
concern over the daughter,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.407 align:middle line:84%
really wanted the daughter to
just get her out so that she

00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:90%
could keep making money.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So the daughter tries to
smuggle the mom out of jail.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The daughter ends up
getting put into jail

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.322 align:middle line:90%
for a year and a half.

00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:90%
So here's the daughter.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's my client
sacrificing herself

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
for her mother in
that past lifetime

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
at around the age
of 15, 16 years old.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:90%
She gets put into the jail.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
The mom gets out six
months later, no big deal.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.775 align:middle line:90%
The mom goes on living her life.

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And doesn't even bother about
trying to smuggle the daughter

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't even bother
with the daughter.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on
and yada, yada, yada.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Turns out my client--

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I think she was in
the US somewhere.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Her jaw was dropped,
and she's like, you're

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
talking about my life
in this lifetime, right?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, this is
very clearly the 1400s.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I can see the attire and
the dress and whatever.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, my mom
was the biggest drug smuggler

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in America for 25 years.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And at the age of 15,
she packed up a suitcase,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.692 align:middle line:84%
and she left me on the beach,
and she ran from the police

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:90%
because they were after her.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:08.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Same age-- 15 years old.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.409 align:middle line:90%
And she was a drug smuggler.

00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:12.659 align:middle line:90%
There's that word, "smuggler."

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:13.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:84%
So the impact of
these past lifetimes--

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
I usually hear all the time,
you're talking about this life,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:20.419 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:20.419 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dad was an
alcoholic, abusive in this life.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
No, really, that happened in
the past life-- same soul,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:90%
repeated pattern.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's the same souls
repeating those patterns as

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
far as the positions
or do you think it's

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:90%
just the situations are being--

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be both.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It can be both.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it's
the exact same soul

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
in the exact same position,
especially in family dynamics

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
because that needs to be
purged out in this lifetime.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
If it's just a
repeated pattern, then

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
it will be the same situation,
same person, different players,

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:90%
but the same setup.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's very cathartic.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very healing.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.855 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell my client,
this is a cool story,

00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad that
you resonate with it,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it's
clearing the karmic energy

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of that past lifetime.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you clear that,
then, just by talking about it?

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always say that that past
lifetime wouldn't have come up

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
if that person didn't already
do the work in clearing it

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:90%
beforehand.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.225 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just validating the
work that they've already done,

00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of just
the nail in the coffin.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's move forward.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So if that person--

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
but the person is
probably reenacting a lot

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of the same patterns, right?

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> At the tail
end of it, though.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.982 align:middle line:90%
>> At the tail end of it.

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:39.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I will only ever
explore a past lifetime when

00:18:39.393 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:90%
they're ready to release it.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, I'm just
validating what you already

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.737 align:middle line:84%
consciously know, and
usually it's always the case.

00:18:45.737 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> OK so they've already
kind of released it then.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.237 align:middle line:84%
>> They've already basically
dealt with it, and it's like,

00:18:50.237 --> 00:18:51.529 align:middle line:90%
oh, that makes so-- thank you--

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.404 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just helping
them connect the dots.

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that's only the
first half of the session.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:90%
It's all the old stuff.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Before you want to get to
your cosmic soul family

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and connect with your truth
and who you really are,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
we gotta clear the old stuff
first before we move forward.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So once we go through
that-- and sometimes there's

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
so much old stuff to
clear, the whole session

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
is taken up by just that,
and they are usually

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
pretty grateful that
we just focused on that

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:90%
because it was very needed.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times, it
will be the first half

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
hour clearing the old stuff.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Second half hour
is like, OK, great.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, why are you on this planet?

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What are your grand
soul contracts

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
with Mother Gaia,
with planet Earth?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's really cool because,
to see someone's saw contracts,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:42.255 align:middle line:84%
I have to go all the way back
to their very last lifetime

00:19:42.255 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:90%
off of this planet.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes they're Annunaki.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're Pleiadian.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're Gray.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that lifetime
where they choose,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to volunteer
to come to planet Earth

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and help them out.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And usually there's
two contracts

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that a soul always kind of
signs up for, especially

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
for this planet in particular.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the two contracts-- this is
for every soul on this planet,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a tree or an
animal or a human, all souls.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And the two contracts
are, what are you here

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in this
incarnation to learn?

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
As a human being, what are you
here on this planet to learn?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.293 align:middle line:84%
So what are you receiving
as being a human?

00:20:23.293 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the second contract

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:90%
is, what are you here to give?

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:90%
What are you here to give back?

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So the receiving, what are you
here to learn, is usually, ah,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to learn that it's
OK to watch humanity suffer

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and not be able
to help everyone.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.572 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge lesson that a lot
of cosmic souls are learning.

00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the other is,
how are you giving back?

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I used to be
a Pleiadian or an Angel

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
or they used to be an
Angel or Pleiadian,

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and so they're here to heal
and open up vortexes and work

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
with crystals and work with
reiki or other kind of healing

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
modalities, which is
incredible, and they've

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
done that in lifetime
after lifetime.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But those two contracts
always collide.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:10%
If you're here to
understand that it's

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:10%
OK to watch others suffer and
you're here to heal the world,

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:10%
usually you have to deal with
the suffering of loved ones

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:10%
while you're healing others
because your loved ones aren't

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:10%
ready to heal themselves.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a big one.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And then-- yeah.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go into other past
lifetimes or future lifetimes

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:90%
that are off this planet.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So what else have you
done other than just

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
being a human off this planet?

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Who else have you been?

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So I love introducing people to
their cosmic parallel selves.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the time it
used to be-- like,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in the past couple
of years, it used

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.308 align:middle line:84%
to be a lot of let's introduce
you to your spirit guides,

00:21:43.308 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
spirit guides that I

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
tend to work with
and see in others

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
are cosmic spirit guides,
interdimensional beings,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that I kind of work with and see
and channel and what have you.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, spirit
guides, that's

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
a very old, traditional concept.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
No longer are we looking
outside of ourselves

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:90%
to receive information.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
We have a plethora of
lifetimes out there

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually absorb
that information from.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm no longer going to
someone's spirit guides.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going straight to themselves
just in another dimension,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
just in another realm.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're narrowing the gap
with our terminology and how we

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
define, like you just said,
defining our spirit guides

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:84%
or defining our parallel
versions of ourselves.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm seeing is this
evolution in this community.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We get caught up on
the terminology of guru

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
or we started looking outside
of ourselves for these things,

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and now we're finding
terminology that we can say,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
well, it's not us,
but it's still us.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it's probably
going to evolve even further.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be interesting how

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
we get closer and closer
to truly just us, right?

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so powerful bringing it
back to source, which is you.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I always spell
the word "universe"

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
with Y-O-U at the beginning
because it's you-niverse.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:90%
You are the universe.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that we are
our own gods in the way that we

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
have source within us, but
we wrote our own contracts

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:90%
to be here.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no man in the sky.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no dictation.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no you have to
do this at this time.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all in flow, and you are
the one who decided to be here.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You are the one who put
that car crash in your life.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.723 align:middle line:84%
There's something there
that you have to learn.

00:23:31.723 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because there

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of
this spiritual ego

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual dilemma
that some people

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of get trapped into of
I don't like being human,

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:84%
so tell me about my
cosmic self instead.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm a Pleiadian.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's who I am.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
We have to let go
of the attachment

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to any sort of identity, whether
it be conscious, cosmic, ego,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:84%
You really do have to let go
of all of those attachments

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and realize that no matter what
you are attached to, whether it

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.935 align:middle line:84%
be interdimensional or
terrestrial, it's not good.

00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:06.185 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be attached.

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:07.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, It's fun to play with.

00:24:07.477 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:90%
But like you said, attachment--

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
if you get attached
to it and you

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:84%
start giving your power
away to those ideas--

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and it's kind of
ironic to say giving your power

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
away to a cosmic
parallel self of yours.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, if you
wanted to be Annunaki,

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to be Pleiadian,
you would have been Pleiadian.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we chose to be
here as humans at this time,

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
so let's do it.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's be human.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's smell all the smells.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's eat the good food.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's taste wine.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's really enjoy our
five senses because I know,

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
as a Gray, I wasn't
able to eat food.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.993 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't able to smell things.

00:24:42.993 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't able to hear.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I had a lot of other
extrasensory abilities,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have the
joy and the excitement

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the little things
and the synchronicities

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that you have here
on this planet.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's heavy.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.537 align:middle line:90%
Yes, It's dense.

00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there's a lot of challenge.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.515 align:middle line:84%
But that's also what
makes it really exciting.

00:25:00.515 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You just said,
when you were a Gray.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.722 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you could
add a little bit--

00:25:04.722 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:84%
tell us about when
you were a Gray.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
How did you find
out you were a Gray,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and what is this other Gray
version of you doing right now?

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So this took
place during my--

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess not
during, but after

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:90%
my first conscious abduction.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was 18 years old
in this incarnation,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and I went away to
a 10-day meditation

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
retreat called Vipassana-- so
completely silent meditation.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And on the second
night of meditation,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I was taken from my room
by three tall white beings.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time, I was
opening up to my abilities

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I had re-experienced a
lot of my past lifetimes.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You kind of mentioned
before, when

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:84%
did you give yourself
permission again,

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and that was when I was 16.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I was really anxious.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:90%
I was really depressed.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I was really
looking for answers.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I went everywhere.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to doctors,
psychologists.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.055 align:middle line:84%
I went to my high
school teachers.

00:26:08.055 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I went to my parents.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I even talked to a priest.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of life?

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:90%
All right, cool.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You're an authority figure.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what I'm
looking to know.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And time and time again,
I was disappointed

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
with the lack of answers and the
oh, you'll get over this phase.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully I do it because I'm
pretty depressed, you know?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I even went to my
friends in high school,

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and I said, do you ever,
like, question things?

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever really
wonder why we're here

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and what this is all about?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:90%
We can drive.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's party.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it was really
disappointing.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
actually my father,

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 16, who
recommended a past life

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he's an
engineer by trade,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
but he took himself
through university

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
by doing past life
regressions on other people.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:06.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and he was doing energy
work and Reiki on us as kids

00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This is your father who
was taking you to the Catholic

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:90%
church?

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Mm-hmm, yeah, the very same
father who was taking me--

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very interesting.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I think he was just doing
the whole Catholic thing

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:90%
through obligation.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So anyway-- so yeah.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me my first
past life regression at 16,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and I went into all
these past lifetimes.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:90%
I opened up to two major things.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
This was my first
huge breakthrough,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
which was time is simultaneous
and reincarnation is real.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We can actually be
in the present moment

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and re-experience things
that happened in the past.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So it really kind of
gave me that validation

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that there is a lot more out
there that not a lot of people

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
are aware of, and I was
determined to uncover

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:90%
the truth, all of the truth.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing past life
regressions on other people.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So I actually took my dad's
notebook and his regression

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
techniques, and obviously I'd
never done this for a living

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:90%
or went to a class or anything.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.438 align:middle line:84%
But I figured, hey,
it's pretty easy.

00:28:12.438 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> With his permission, I hope?

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, with his permission.

00:28:14.938 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:90%
For sure, for sure.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And so anyone and
everyone who just willing

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and listen
to me, I'm like, hey,

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:84%
do you want to see
something cool?

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And I would take them
into these past lifetimes.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got
into university,

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I went away, moved away from
home at 18, went to university.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I started doing all
my university friends,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:90%
and it was really interesting.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But I started to realize
that not everyone was

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
open and ready
and willing to let

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:84%
go of their current
present moment ego

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:84%
state, their human,
their attachment

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to the present moment to be able
to be in a trance-like state

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to go back into
those past lifetimes.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought everyone
could do it very easily.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily the case.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So I basically thought
to myself, why don't I

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
just put myself into a
trance-like state so that I can

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
see that information
so that I don't have

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to go through the arduous
process of separating their ego

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
mind from their current
state so that they

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:84%
can start to travel into
these other states of being?

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing
deep states of meditation,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:90%
deep states of trance.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I basically took
myself through all

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of the hypnotherapy regression
techniques in meditation,

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and in that state of being,
I just guided myself,

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and I started going everywhere,
into many, many past lifetimes.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I started channeling
things like quantum physics

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.155 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometry
and understanding

00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
what all of these
things meant and what

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:90%
was going on on the planet.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
that abduction

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that happened at
18 during Vipassana

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that I really fully understood
that aliens were real.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So up until that
point, telepathy

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:84%
was very prominent in my mind,
sometimes too much prominent,

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%
too prominent.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I was remote viewing.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I was astral traveling.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:84%
To be honest-- maybe don't
tell this to my university--

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
but I ended up passing and
getting really good grades

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because I would just pinpoint
the smartest person in the room

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and I would astral travel
over their shoulder,

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and I would actually
read their answers.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.761 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And I always
found that I tested--

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So you were astral cheating.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I was astral cheating.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.463 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, I don't think
you were breaking any rules,

00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
so to say, but
they might not be--

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> No, definitely not
breaking any rules.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Future rules are gonna--

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So yeah-- so I was really
open at that point in time.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
abducted, I mean, that's

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
when a whole other
world opened up to me.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, aliens are real.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they
real, but they're here.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks after
the abduction experience,

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I started having very vivid
flashback and very vivid

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
recall to myself as one of
these interdimensional beings.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So not only are they here,
not only are they real,

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:84%
but we have actually been
them before ourselves.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.527 align:middle line:84%
And so it got to
the point where--

00:31:09.527 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
people ask me this all the
time, so I have to say,

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I was completely sober.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Got to the point where
I was walking down

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
the hall of my university
going to class,

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
middle of the day,
and all of a sudden I

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
would have a flashback
to a past lifetime

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
where I was an 8 foot tall
Gray being walking down

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:90%
the hallway of a spaceship.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And here I am just in the
present moment, like, what?

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that, still to
this day, the trippiest moment,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the trippiest
experience that I ever

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
had as one of these
flashbacks was

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I was hanging out at home,
still 18 years old, university

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
student, and I was sitting
there in meditation,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
I had this flashback.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I became
this 8 foot tall Gray.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
my hands because I

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:90%
thought they were really cool.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I only had four fingers,
super long fingers.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I was studying my hand.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this really dimly lit
room onboard this spaceship,

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and it felt like
I was all alone.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
at each fingertip.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I observe each
one of my four fingers,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:84%
a little, tiny sphere
of transparent energy

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:84%
pops up, just hovering above
each one of my fingertips.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.567 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, that's cool.

00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a sudden,
this larger sphere

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:10%
pops up in the
middle of my palm.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And intuitively, I just
ask the question, hmm,

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what this
energy can do?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I hear this deep, booming
voice speaking back to me,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:90%
saying--

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.630 align:middle line:90%
what did it say--

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:90%
manipulate material.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, whoa, that's so cool.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to be
telekinetic, even as a kid.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I'd be four years old.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd watch my brother's
model planes up

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:84%
in the corner of his room, and
I would try and make them move,

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and I would try so hard to
just let's get the plane.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I know I can make
that plane move.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And I never was able to do it.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But in an instant in seeing
myself as this Gray being,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.680 align:middle line:84%
understanding that the ability,
one of the abilities anyway,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that I had was to
manipulate material,

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
turning a water bottle
into a sphere, a glass

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:90%
sphere, or glass into gold.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is possible
at the molecular level,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to do those
things as that Gray--

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:84%
so instant validation
for those feelings,

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
those deep-rooted feelings
that I've always had.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
OK, that's cool.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I shake off the orbs, and I
just intuitively, as this Gray--

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling out this body,
18 years old as a human,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:90%
walking into this Gray body.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I walk into the other room
of this ship, much smaller

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:90%
room, very dimly lit.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
There was one light
that was coming down

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the room,
and there was a chair

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of this room.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.073 align:middle line:84%
And there was three
medium-height--

00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
they were a little
bit shorter than me--

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Grays.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And all the Grays were looking
at this man, human man,

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.222 align:middle line:84%
I guess, sitting in this chair
in the middle of this room.

00:34:05.222 --> 00:34:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And as they're looking at this
man-- they're observing him.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.722 align:middle line:90%
They're checking him out.

00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:90%
The man's freaked out, right?

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like he was
nonverbal because he wasn't

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
actually able to, like-- he was
doing a lot of grunting, but no

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:90%
actual words.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.030 align:middle line:90%
No, help me.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:90%
There was none of that.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.002 align:middle line:90%
It was just a lot of grunting.

00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So as I walk into this room,
I'm taking a look at this man.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, so that
looks like a human,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.308 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily the
humans that we know today.

00:34:29.308 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I take a look
at him, I notice

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that he's got fairly dark
skin, long, straggly hair,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
big, protruding forehead,
he was hunched over,

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.409 align:middle line:90%
and he was nonverbal.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm recognizing this
man as-- and at the time,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I was taking an
archeology class,

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and I recognized this man as
between Homo erectus and Homo

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:90%
sapien.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't
necessarily Neanderthal.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I was just saying,
not Neanderthal?

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.707 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:34:57.707 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Not totally sure.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.270 align:middle line:10%
He could have been Neanderthal.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:10%
He felt a little bit more
advanced than Neanderthal,

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:10%
kind of like the tool stage.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they had
tools at that time.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But here I was, 18
years old, first

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
getting introduced to myself
as this tall Gray being,

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm 18 human girl into this
Gray body observing, literally,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the precipice, the beginning
of humanity as we know it.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So what a trip it was to be a
girl in a Gray body observing

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:84%
humanity, observing
this man as a Gray.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It was such a wild experience,
and even to this day,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that
memory, the visuals,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.790 align:middle line:90%
are just burned into my mind.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I can see it still clear as day.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, I started
communicating with this Gray.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, who are you?

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, I am you.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It was so wild
getting introduced

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:90%
to this other version of myself.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And although it was something
that I'd never researched,

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I honestly--

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.065 align:middle line:84%
if you asked me at 18
if I believed in aliens,

00:35:58.065 --> 00:35:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm sure there's
something out there,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.580 align:middle line:84%
but, I mean, I never
defined myself as an alien.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I never thought that
we could be alien.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I never thought that any
of that was even possible.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And you knew
that this was you.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:90%
You weren't just observing--

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I was-- no, I was not.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --another alien or something?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Because at this point, I'd
done a lot of astral traveling.

00:36:14.662 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd done a lot of
past life regression

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:90%
on myself and others.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I do a past life
regression on others,

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I will be a third-party
perspective.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I will be literally floating
in the room observing

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:90%
someone's lifetime go by.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:84%
When I know I'm
regressing myself

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hopping into my own past
lifetime, I will be in the--

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
what is it called--
first-person perspective.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So I knew right away.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this was me.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:10%
And then I started
telepathically communicating

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:10%
with this being, this self
of mine, because I could--

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:10%
when I was existing as
this Gray and hopping

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:10%
into the body of that Gray,
observing that lifetime,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:10%
I could actually
ask questions, and I

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:10%
would get an immediate
response as if it

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.770 align:middle line:10%
was in the present moment,
even though this was

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:10%
a past lifetime around
500,000 years ago

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:10%
or whenever those Neanderthals
were first starting,

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:10%
or the Homo erectus, were first
starting to really walk around

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you feel what
this Gray was feeling?

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And how is that?

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we're-- sort of people
who are following the show kind

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:84%
of know that or have understood
that the Gray emotional

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:34.447 align:middle line:84%
spectrum has been a little
bit narrower than humans,

00:37:34.447 --> 00:37:36.780 align:middle line:84%
even though they're very
advanced with their technology,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
even though they can
telepathically communicate--

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but as far as having some
emotional things that we humans

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.727 align:middle line:90%
So is that true?

00:37:45.727 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel it?

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I think this is
a really big misconception.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, before I say it's
a big misconception,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a wide, wide
spectrum and wide variety

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of Gray species out
there in the universe.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a ton of
them, and there's

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.200 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different varying
ones, and there's also--

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:10%
I like to call them agreeable
Grays versus disagreeable

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:10%
Grays.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.685 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, can you define
that a little bit?

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Agreeable like they
agree with each other

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:90%
or we agree with them?

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Agreeable Grays being Grays
who are here for the collective

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, Grays who are
here for service to others.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.220 align:middle line:90%
The disagreeable Grays--

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't like saying
bad guys and good guys,

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:84%
but the disagreeable
ones are the ones

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:90%
who are service to self.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:84%
They are existing
for themselves.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
Grays are all bad.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.405 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have to make
that kind of distinction.

00:38:33.405 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's a huge
misconception that Grays

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
don't have the emotion.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is that
they can't express emotion

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.930 align:middle line:90%
on their face.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right?

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
facial expressions.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't have facial
features like we do?

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And so humans recognize
emotions in other humans

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.735 align:middle line:90%
through facial expressions.

00:38:50.735 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:90%
That's emotional intelligence.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.833 align:middle line:84%
Grays are completely telepathic
and extremely visual, and--

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So they don't need
to use the face muscles.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't need to
use it at all, right?

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Grays basically walk
around their spaceship

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:84%
being able to see auras
and energies of other Grays

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and other beings on the ship.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So if one Gray is having a
bad day, everyone in the room

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:90%
can feel it.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like we can
pick up on that--

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:84%
but if we're not
expressing it on our face,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:84%
we're not necessarily
attuned to, oh,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that energy is coming
from that person,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:90%
whereas Grays it's all visual.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:90%
You can see it very clearly.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So Grays are very highly
emotionally intelligent.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They just have much more
control over their emotions.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> They just have
much more control.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so they're not going to
spin out of control like we do?

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They have more filters, and
humans are very reactionary.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's really funny
because sometimes I'll

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
watch myself in
videos, and I think

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that I make very goofy faces
when I'm talking and getting

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:90%
really into information.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think I overexpress
my face because I can

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:10%
because I'm a human.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.782 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, why not?

00:40:03.782 --> 00:40:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I never had
that-- because people--

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I know you can't--

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:84%
everyone's telepathic, but you
can't just read my emotions.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
So I feel, as a human--

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:84%
because humans are a little
bit lower on the spectrum

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:90%
of maybe advanced spiritually--

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I have to overemphasize
all of my emotions.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so in understanding
myself as a Gray,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, that makes
sense, and that makes sense,

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and that makes sense.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, as a kid, hair used
to really freak me out.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't handle, like--

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Hair?

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hair.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:90%
My mom--

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Why would hair freak you out?

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I had no idea until I
understood that I was coming

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.050 align:middle line:90%
from this Gray being.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would hair
freak a Gray being out?

00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:45.558 align:middle line:90%
They don't have it?

00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Grays
don't have hair,

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.395 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
weird concept for me.

00:40:50.395 --> 00:40:51.195 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:40:51.195 --> 00:40:51.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:40:51.995 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I would-- it
was really gross,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and my mom had this thick, black
hair, and I'd find it places.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
this is disgusting.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't understand
the concept of hair.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And even when I was a kid,
I had such a hard time

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
going to sleep because I
felt-- this sounds very odd,

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:84%
but I had a hard time closing
my eyes because I didn't know

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
what to do with my eyelids.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, I felt like
it wasn't natural

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.530 align:middle line:90%
for me to close my eyelids.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So my eyelids felt
like it was an effort

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.462 align:middle line:90%
to close my eyes at nighttime.

00:41:25.462 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And so Grays
don't have eyelids.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Grays don't have eyelids.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't blink?

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they don't blink.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:41:31.485 --> 00:41:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe some
of them do, but--

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they've got caps
or covers over their eyes.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> A cap?

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.763 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK, so like for water,
rain, or other stuff,

00:41:42.763 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:90%
or how does that work?

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of like
thinking about sunglasses

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.320 align:middle line:90%
for their eyes.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So you know how you see Grays
as with the big black eyes?

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Those are actually just caps.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> They're artificial caps
like a sunglass thing?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.710 align:middle line:84%
They have eyes very
similar to humans.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:90%
They can be green.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:90%
They can be blue.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:90%
They can be brown.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But they put the caps
over because their eyes

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.210 align:middle line:84%
are so big that they're
oversensitive to light.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why you go in
a lot of Gray ships

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and it will be very dimly
lit, kind of like this,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:90%
except without that big light.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, super interesting.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
What other-- after
this Gray experience--

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.952 align:middle line:84%
and you're known
now for connecting

00:42:30.952 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:90%
with all these Star Families.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> After that, what other types
of beings have you connected

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So after that, they sort
of giving me all of this

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.020 align:middle line:90%
information on quantum physics.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
scientifically advanced,

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're also very
genetically advanced as well.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So they do a lot of
that gene splicing,

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the
hybridization, and that's

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:90%
what this tall Gray, who is me--

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and his name is
Heera, H-E-E-R-A.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what Heera was
really good at was--

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to talk
to Heera tomorrow, right?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going
to talk to Heera.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we are, and
it's really cool.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So anything having to do
with the hybridization

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
project, the
advancement of humanity,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the Essassanis, that's
what he's really good at.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he can explain
all of that to you.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And then-- yeah, so huge
quantum physics downloads.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They started unlocking
and opening up my DNA.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were teaching
me about Tesla technology

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
at the age like
19, 20 years old.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, so you're talking
to me about perpetual energy.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to me about
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.760 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching me
Tesla technology.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have the
Grays reiterate, well,

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:90%
who do you think taught Tesla?

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, OK,
yeah, here we go.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
that happened after I really

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:84%
opened up to my true self
was the Galactic Federation

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.693 align:middle line:84%
started to contact me all the
time, actually every month.

00:43:56.693 --> 00:43:58.235 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a
Galactic Federation?

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There sure is a
Galactic Federation.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:43:59.835 align:middle line:90%
>> We've heard rumors.

00:43:59.835 --> 00:44:00.635 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know if--

00:44:00.635 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic Federation, for
those of you who don't know,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is basically a government
structure out there

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.840 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.988 align:middle line:84%
Now, honestly, I was studying
global political economy,

00:44:12.988 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and that's what my major is in.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I did a double major, but
that's one of them was in.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
what powers that

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:23.190 align:middle line:84%
be, where that comes from on
the planet, which was economy,

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:90%
money, and politics, right?

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So I studied that,
and I was really

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
like antigovernment, really
anti-corruption, really

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:84%
understanding the
system from the inside

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and rightfully
angry, in a sense.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I got contacted
by the Galactic Federation

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and they told me who they
were and what they did,

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I was so disappointed.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I was so disappointed.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
government-like structure

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:90%
out there?

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Out in space?

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'm like--

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But it can't be as rigid
and hierarchical as ours--

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not hierarchical
in that sense.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> --or even secrecy
and compartmentalized.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's not.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not corrupt,
even though there

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.360 align:middle line:84%
can be individual players
that could corrupt the system.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.750 align:middle line:90%
But I was so disappointed.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, OK, so you're telling
me that it doesn't change?

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me that
it doesn't get better?

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.720 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me that
you don't have solutions

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.148 align:middle line:84%
to organizational problems that
we have here on the planet?

00:45:25.148 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me that you're
an eighth-dimensional Pleiadian

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and you still have to
have this structure?

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I was so excited to
explore these other realms,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and then I was
disappointed to think

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, it's the same
old, same old up there.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But is it really
the same old, same old?

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's similar but different.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.530 align:middle line:90%
The biggest sort of--

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.930 align:middle line:90%
what would I call it?

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the biggest sort of
discernment or organizational

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
thing that they have out
there in the universe

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is between service
to others' souls

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and service to self souls--

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
so basically, low-vibrational
individuals, beings,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.957 align:middle line:84%
and high-vibrational
individuals and beings.

00:46:09.957 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:84%
All the high-vibrational
ones, they just all

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.953 align:middle line:90%
want to get along.

00:46:12.953 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I started to
understand that we do

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:84%
live in a binary universe
filled with ones and zeros,

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and in the binary universe,
you have light and dark.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And you really can't have
the light without the dark.

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I really, truly believe
that the binary aspect

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of this universe, the
light and the dark,

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.050 align:middle line:84%
is kind of what propels, pushes
us, and allows us to grow,

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.610 align:middle line:90%
change, and move forward.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In doing all this work,
you've connected cosmically

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to your other versions of
you and connecting astral

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:90%
cosmically to--

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
helping other people
do their thing.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you have anybody
earthbound that inspires you?

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be in this field
of work or otherwise.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So interesting.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.072 align:middle line:90%
I had a bit of a--

00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say any ego death,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.360 align:middle line:84%
but I had a bit of a moment when
I was maybe 19 or 20 years old,

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 27 now.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the moment was, why
don't I have a mentor?

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Why have I never looked up
to anyone in this lifetime?

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And even when my friends
were 14 years old

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and they're putting
posters of Good Charlotte

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and Green Day on
their wall, I just

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:84%
never really had that feeling,
never had that inkling.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Even Elon Musk?

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, even--

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he just reminds
me of a Zeta kind of guy.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's
interesting, actually,

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and I still remember
this memory clear as day.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.368 align:middle line:84%
I was riding on a
bus, and I think

00:47:46.368 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I was going to and from
high school or something.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I was 16, 17.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And I got the
message, the download,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to not do any external research.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time, I didn't
know what-- what do you mean?

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not supposed to read a book?

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not supposed to--

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and they said, you're
about to open yourself up.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:04.920 align:middle line:84%
This is after my
past life regression,

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
so things started to really
kind of come back to me.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And my spirit guides
came through and said,

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.250 align:middle line:90%
don't do any external research.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they basically
said, you can

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.470 align:middle line:84%
watch TV and read other
books, but specifically

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.290 align:middle line:84%
in the field of anything
quantum physics,

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.920 align:middle line:84%
anything science, anything
spiritual, anything awakening,

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.190 align:middle line:84%
anything chakras, anything
energy, and anything aliens,

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.210 align:middle line:90%
do not touch.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't do any external research.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And what they explained to
me back then was bringing

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.670 align:middle line:84%
other peoples information, no
matter it be good, bad, ugly,

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:84%
aligned, the truth,
disinformation, what have you,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.620 align:middle line:84%
bringing in other
peoples' information

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to cloud
my own perception.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I already have to deal with
my 27-year-old self coming

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.980 align:middle line:84%
in the mix and with the
translation of the information,

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.870 align:middle line:84%
let alone needing
to deal with all

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of the perception
from everyone else

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that I'm receiving
information from.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So they said, keep your
channel as clear as possible

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:90%
and you will never regret it.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is, when I started
to really channel, 18, 19, 20,

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and beyond, it was really tough.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I got really hated
on for the fact

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't do any
external research.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
what do you mean?

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you
don't look into this?

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you-- you don't
have any discernment.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, look, I've had enough
experience where I can easily

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.570 align:middle line:84%
discern what's a good
vibration from a bad vibration

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.070 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And now it's really interesting
when I tell people and experts

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and I go to conferences that I
don't do any external research,

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.230 align:middle line:90%
it is one of my superpowers.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my
greatest strengths,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I've
never read a book,

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that I've never looked at anyone
else's content or information,

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that I have no idea
what anyone else is

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.020 align:middle line:84%
saying on the information
that I speak about.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.658 align:middle line:84%
People are like, hey,
have you read Nietzsche?

00:49:57.658 --> 00:49:58.700 align:middle line:90%
You sound like Nietzsche.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, like the philosopher.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for sure.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, cool.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Albert Einstein,
he has that theory too.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I love getting
the validation.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't need the validation
because I have that experience

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:84%
from within, and I'm pretty
firm on what I experience,

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and I try not to allow other
people to kind of infiltrate

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.940 align:middle line:90%
that experience in that way.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how do you develop a
vocabulary to talk about this

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:84%
stuff, then, because
I've noticed,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.870 align:middle line:84%
without researching it, you
can't have the vocabulary.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's really difficult.
I use a lot of words,

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and I define
everything that I use--

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.490 align:middle line:84%
so even defining
the fifth dimension,

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:45.240 align:middle line:84%
defining consciousness,
defining god, defining source.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of find my own
terminology and my own words

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of things,
and usually there's

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:84%
five words to explain one
concept because language

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.990 align:middle line:90%
is the biggest block.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest limiting
force that I'm up against

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is how to actually explain
all the information that I'm

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.100 align:middle line:90%
receiving.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So I still feel confined
and limited with language.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But even as a kid, I was
obsessed with big words,

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:12.930 align:middle line:90%
obsessed.

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So any sort of--

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't spell.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I still can't spell.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But I would love
these big words,

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.543 align:middle line:84%
and so I was just hungry for as
many words as I possibly could,

00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and I really feel like that
was kind of my training ground

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.650 align:middle line:84%
for being able to communicate
in the way that I do.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say
that I'm very clear and very

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.510 align:middle line:84%
concise in explaining
concepts that

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:38.600 align:middle line:84%
could be very daunting or
overwhelming for most people.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So talking about vocabulary,
you just mentioned fifth

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.040 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of the density
terminology of densities?

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes I
say fifth dimension,

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.580 align:middle line:84%
fifth dimension density,
fifth density, third density.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So I understand the
different dimensions

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.060 align:middle line:90%
through visual representations.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I understand pretty much all
quantum physics or the quantum

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:84%
universe and the vibrational
universe through visuals.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.100 align:middle line:90%
So I see everything.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I call the
different dimensions densities,

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.630 align:middle line:84%
as well, because I see this
third dimension as a very

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:15.210 align:middle line:90%
dense plane of existence.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
ask me, well,

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.890 align:middle line:84%
how do interdimensional beings
exist in the eighth dimension?

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Do they still have bodies?

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And they do, but the density of
the body is a lot less dense.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So things like all the
upkeep, all the maintenance

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go through
as a third-dimensional human,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.667 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot, you know?

00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the eighth dimension,
you don't necessarily

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.980 align:middle line:90%
have to eat food.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:41.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily have to
have all of the maintenance

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.340 align:middle line:84%
as something such as a
third-dimension body.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in past episodes,
I've covered sort of this idea

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of dimensions and density a lot,
and we've kind of established,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.720 align:middle line:84%
but we know because every
channeler and every person has

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:84%
their different downloads
and different definitions

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.420 align:middle line:90%
or wording around that.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So I was just wondering what
your terminology was for that,

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.590 align:middle line:90%
for densities and--

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I really switch
it up, and I don't know.

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just very interesting.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll just kind of
briefly explain

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.110 align:middle line:84%
the first couple of dimensions,
just how I perceive it,

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and I had this beautiful
explanation the other day,

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:21.540 align:middle line:84%
but when I channel, sometimes
things come through me,

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't remember
them because I don't create

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:25.055 align:middle line:90%
a conscious memory of them.

00:53:25.055 --> 00:53:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe that
we're moving into something

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that I like to call 5D
memory, which is really cool.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So no longer are
we storing memories

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.190 align:middle line:90%
in our third-dimensional brain--

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:39.135 align:middle line:84%
so all the neural pathways and
the brainwaves and all of that.

00:53:39.135 --> 00:53:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Cramming for a test,
trying to get those--

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --memories in there.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that anymore.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.640 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
something that I see as--

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I call it cloud storage.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's like our soul, our
higher self without the body,

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is just kind of
looming all around us,

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.030 align:middle line:90%
and everything is kept there.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything from our
subconscious brain

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
is kept in this
cloud storage, in

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:90%
this fifth-dimensional memory.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.603 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having
to linear think about--

00:54:05.603 --> 00:54:07.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, where
did I put my keys?

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Where did I have them last?

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Where did I go?

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's retrace the steps.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a
third-dimensional memory.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
In fifth-dimensional
memory, boom, it just comes.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just right there.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have to let
go of the ego state.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go of the
reaction, the attachment,

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the what have you in
order to be able to tune

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.550 align:middle line:90%
into that frequency.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So the first
dimension is oneness.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It's source.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's existence.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just everything and
nothing all at the same time.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Second dimension is the mind.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.880 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
it's aware of itself.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK, there's
something happening.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:42.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference here.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:46.210 align:middle line:84%
There's everything and nothing,
and then there's the mind.

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.000 align:middle line:10%
And then the third
dimension is the body.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.710 align:middle line:10%
So you've got
everything and nothing,

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:51.870 align:middle line:10%
then you've got the mind,
the awareness of self,

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.662 align:middle line:10%
and then you move into
the third dimension.

00:54:53.662 --> 00:54:54.579 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I'm in a body now.

00:54:54.579 --> 00:54:55.379 align:middle line:10%
OK, great.

00:54:55.379 --> 00:54:56.190 align:middle line:10%
I've got a mind.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:57.060 align:middle line:10%
I've got awareness.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.350 align:middle line:10%
I've got a body.

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
dimension, I believe,

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.500 align:middle line:90%
is the dimension of time.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's where time gets
a little bit more lucid.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it gets a
little bit slower.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it gets faster.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And then in the fifth
dimension and beyond,

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those concepts
we still have--

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:14.010 align:middle line:90%
the mind.

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.968 align:middle line:90%
We still have the body.

00:55:14.968 --> 00:55:15.870 align:middle line:90%
We still have source.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We still have all of
the other dimensions,

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:22.230 align:middle line:84%
but there's extra added
vibrational frequencies

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to that to make everything
a little bit more lucid.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of only having
the mind, instead

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of only having consciousness,
instead of only having

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the body, you've got
these other elements

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that really kind of twist
things up and allow you

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to kind of be in a state of
flow with both space and time.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm at a place in my
life right now and at a place

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.860 align:middle line:84%
in my channeling
where, when I tap in,

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.730 align:middle line:90%
time and space don't exist.

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So I can go back into ancient
Egypt in a split of a second.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I can download five hours of
information in two minutes.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So those kind of concepts
are very lucid for me

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:84%
because I operate a lot in
the fifth-dimension frequency,

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and I surpass both the
third and the fourth.

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But one of my biggest teachings
is that everyone can do this.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is a soul.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be a
fifth-generational psychic

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.410 align:middle line:90%
to have these abilities.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Innately, we are all telepathic.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Innately, we are all channelers.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Innately, we all
have past lifetimes

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.445 align:middle line:84%
that we're connecting
to in every moment.

00:56:24.445 --> 00:56:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest teaching
that I have is,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.640 align:middle line:84%
hey, I am no different than
each and every one of you,

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and I am just like all of you.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything that
you're curious about?

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.050 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all my curiosities
have been answered

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.670 align:middle line:84%
by the information
that I channel.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So I like to call myself
like a universal Google.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about having
Google, the search engine,

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.680 align:middle line:84%
in front of you-- and
essentially Google

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.120 align:middle line:84%
contains all knowledge
or a lot of the knowledge

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.930 align:middle line:84%
here on this third-dimension
plane on planet Earth,

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:01.532 align:middle line:84%
but in order to get any
information from Google,

00:57:01.532 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:90%
what do you have to do?

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Type in your search terms.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You got to ask
for what you want.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You got to type in
a question, right?

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.490 align:middle line:90%
So I'm connected.

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:09.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully connected.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But I have to have the right
questions to gain access

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to the right information.

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:16.780 align:middle line:84%
For me, at first when I started
channeling, it was like,

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.580 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.413 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:57:18.413 --> 00:57:19.770 align:middle line:90%
What's going on over here?

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.660 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate
to this lifetime?

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was so much.

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It was very overwhelming.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It was really exciting.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'm at this point
where I've answered

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot of my own questions.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So I find the best kind of
channeling that I can do--

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and I surprise myself
even though it's not me

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.070 align:middle line:90%
who surprises myself.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the information that
surprises me as a 27-year-old--

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:45.390 align:middle line:84%
when other people ask me
really incredible questions ,

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and I get to those depths
of levels, and I say, wow,

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
really, you had no idea?

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I've never asked
that question before.

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That information is not my own.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:55.680 align:middle line:90%
It's universal information.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But what I've been extremely
curious about in the past 10

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:02.100 align:middle line:84%
years since opening up
to my channeling ability

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is two things, two really
big things actually.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.450 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, how
does the universe work?

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:12.062 align:middle line:84%
Is that not the grand
question of how--

00:58:12.062 --> 00:58:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big question.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.395 align:middle line:90%
I ask that all the time.

00:58:13.395 --> 00:58:14.645 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big question, right?

00:58:14.645 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:90%
How does the universe work?

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we ask the question
of how the universe works,

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.470 align:middle line:90%
it's very quantifiable.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's very scientific.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.953 align:middle line:90%
It's very measurable.

00:58:22.953 --> 00:58:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though we don't have all of
the measurement instruments and

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't have necessarily
all of the equations,

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.620 align:middle line:90%
it's very easily studied.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not there
yet for all of it,

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:35.820 align:middle line:84%
but the how the universe
works is quantum.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the quantum physics
aspect of parallel realities

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and vibrational
frequency and oscillation

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic
frequency and auras and torus

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And then so I see that.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I see the how of the
how the universe works

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.580 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm at this point where
I will actually see

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.440 align:middle line:90%
physical objects in wave form.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing
this years ago

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.390 align:middle line:84%
where I would be downtown
Toronto, actually,

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and I would see 80-floor
skyscrapers just waving.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'd nudge my friend.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Hey, do you see
that building move?

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it just me?

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.210 align:middle line:90%
They're like, OK, no.

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, it's kind of
like a blind in the wind.

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:16.918 align:middle line:84%
They're like, what
are you talking about?

00:59:16.918 --> 00:59:17.900 align:middle line:90%
That's a building.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, cool.

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was seeing
it as a wave form,

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and I started to understand
how the universe works

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:28.380 align:middle line:84%
from the quantum level,
the subatomic level, all

00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the way to the macro, the
micro and the macro, right?

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:33.900 align:middle line:90%
So I started to understand that.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The second biggest question
that I've been tackling--

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.240 align:middle line:84%
once again, huge
question, a question

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that the priest that I asked
couldn't answer, which is why?

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Why us?

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Why all of this?

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Why existence in general?

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Which is way more philosophical,
way more theoretical.

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the how
the universe works

00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:56.250 align:middle line:90%
and the why the universe works.

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I
truly believe that I

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.630 align:middle line:84%
have some of the biggest
answers that fill in the gaps

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that scientists and philosophers
and religious leaders

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
have been unable to answer
about both the how and the why.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's
not my information.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They're not my answers.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I just believe that I have an
untainted, objective awareness

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring
in the information

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%
without any sort of ego input.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the most potent
insight that you've received

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.460 align:middle line:84%
from doing all this 10
years of channeling,

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional travel?

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that you could round up

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in one nice, little, compact,
juicy bit for our audience?

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's a huge question,
and there's a lot of insight.

01:00:45.262 --> 01:00:46.470 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of information.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:47.490 align:middle line:90%
But there's one thing.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> The one thing.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Super profound.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I can be as concise
and clear as possible.

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And this might actually
trigger a lot of people.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
might not like this,

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to say it because
this has been the biggest

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
thing, which is I've understood
that human beings are not

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
actually the third-dimensional
beings that we perceive

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
ourselves as.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe in going
back, channeling

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information, speaking
to the Galactic Federation,

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
going back into our
hidden human history,

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that over centuries we have been
genetically manipulated to have

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
a variety of interdimensional
DNA that is laying dormant

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.140 align:middle line:90%
within us right now.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I believe that we're aliens.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
far more powerful.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And how can someone apply
that knowledge to themselves,

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:45.260 align:middle line:90%
to their way of life?

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest thing is just
understanding that we have been

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
suppressed, that we
have been controlled,

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and that our prefrontal
cortex, our fight and flight

01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms, our Reptilian
brain, has been stimulated

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and overstimulated so that
we are constantly in a state

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of fight and flight so that we
are unable to unlock the DNA

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.920 align:middle line:90%
that we truly have.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
the entire control

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
mechanism on this planet
is based around the fact

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are far more
powerful than what we've

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
been led to believe, and
they're trying to keep us away

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.560 align:middle line:90%
from that power.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest thing
is you're powerful,

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
you create your own reality,
you put yourself here,

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and there is a ton
of gifts just waiting

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
to be unlocked within you.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.550 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:42.247 align:middle line:84%
Finally, with all of your
experience in doing all this--

01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
this is a little bit similar
to the last question,

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:48.080 align:middle line:90%
but a little bit different.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Your interdimensional travels--
you're talking to ETs.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.130 align:middle line:90%
You're realizing you are an ET.

01:02:55.130 --> 01:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
What vision or what
insights for planet Earth

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
was the highest vision of Earth
that you foresee in, let's say,

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.650 align:middle line:90%
the next 20 to 30 years?

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
What vision for
humanity do you have?

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So I used to get a lot
of downloads and visions.

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Half of my visions used to be
very apocalyptic and related

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to World War III and a
lot of nuclear warfare.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The other half of
my visions were

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, cosmic utopia
that was on this planet

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:29.750 align:middle line:90%
where everyone's conscious.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's smiling
at each other.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's aware.

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's realizing and
understanding past lifetimes.

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:38.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really incredible.

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the past three
years, I have not

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.040 align:middle line:90%
had one apocalyptic vision.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I really truly
see this advancement.

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I see hybrids coming
to the planet.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I see us developing,
growing, ascending,

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
moving into this new
vibrational plane of existence,

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
creating a new dynamic
on this planet.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it sounds
like a really big task,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
but I think that
we're going to have

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
a huge upheaval of
the socioeconomic,

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
of the education, of
the political sector

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, even the mass
media sector on this planet,

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:14.030 align:middle line:90%
and I--

01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of happening now.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It is happening, and it's
all for the better of humanity.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all for the ascension
and the conscious evolution

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
of the collective,
and that's what I see.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
That's essentially--
there's actually

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.570 align:middle line:90%
no other path other than that.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.130 align:middle line:90%
We are on the right track.

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It seems really
chaotic right now.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be this way so
that we can collapse the old

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
in order to enter into the new.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can walk around
smiling at each other.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> We sure should.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Elizabeth April.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Awesome journey
we just went down.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait till we get
into some channeling,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to visit
your Zeta self as well

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%
as a Mantis being, correct?

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we are.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:04:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't wait.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:13.030 align:middle line:90%
So good.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for your patience
in our technical difficulties.
