00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:04.990 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.990 --> 00:01:21.836 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the Pleiadian
Collective as always.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.715 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to have
the opportunity to link up

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:90%
with you in this way.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.855 align:middle line:84%
And we'll give you back
Nora if you need her again.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a good transition.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> In a moment.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, thank you.

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:10%
>> But this is a big part of
what's happening on your world

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:10%
as you integrate
your higher selves,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:10%
meaning your fifth
dimensional identity.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:10%
So that's the way we put it.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:10%
That's the story we're telling
right now, that all of you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:10%
are in that process of breathing
into your chakra systems

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:10%
the fullness of your beingness
as your higher selves.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, then
your higher selves begin

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite your
genetic codes, and they

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
overwrite those programs that
tell you you're enslaved.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
You then access your
sovereign state.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is how all your
systems on your world

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
are going to change.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of
going in and fixing

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:90%
what appears to be broken.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We would say let all
that breakage fall away.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Let all of those systems
that have become inoperable

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
that you're all still trying
to operate, let them fall away

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and allow the higher
selves to help you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
all burst into your reality,
higher vibrational versions

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
of all of those systems--

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
education, government,
transportation, fuel,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
on and on and on and on.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're speaking in a very
third dimensional way now.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you integrate
and re-ascend and move

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
into a higher interpretation
of this reality,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
you're still going to run
some of those systems.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They're just going to
look very different.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a way, the
same way we're breathing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in, re-programming the DNA,
reprogram the entire world

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> With this new
higher self energy.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So the world would be channeling
the higher self in a way?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and Earth is
doing exactly the same.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You are doing this
in tandem with Earth.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
work any of you can do

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is your own internal
work, because the outside

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
is the reflection of the inner.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So as you alter
internally, you will

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
pull that external
reflection to you.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
You will run more in
tandem with the process

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:90%
earth is going through itself.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of you get
distracted by what's

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
happening around you, what's
happening on the planet.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You think, I've got
to go into this system

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and figure out a new way.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
We would say, well,
that's wonderful

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that you have a desire
to figure out a new way.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
That truly is wonderful
that you have a desire

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to figure out a new way.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But first go within
and feel that new way

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.042 align:middle line:90%
within your own body.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not so much
outside of ourselves.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs to kind
of do their own work.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then things
will naturally fall

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
into place without even having
to do the work, so to speak?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.817 align:middle line:90%
This is the Pleiadians here.

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is a natural
evolution that occurs.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And truly, it's not
even really breathing

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
in the energies of
your higher selves

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:84%
because you already
are your higher selves.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:90%
You already are.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It's recognizing
the truth of that.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you
will use the illusion

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
of I'm going to breathe in
the energies of my higher self

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to help yourself understand
this goes back to labels

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and categorizing, you see.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So this helps your third
dimensional mind, mental body,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.995 align:middle line:84%
the mental body begins to
accept the idea of breathing

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in the energy of
the higher self,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
because the third dimensional
mental body sees the higher

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:90%
self as above.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So the mental body
thinks, oh, I've

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
got to breathe it in to
be able to integrate.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is you already
are your higher self.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So you start to
access more and more

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
the energies of your higher self
in your entire chakra system,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
especially the lower chakras.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you have a very
easy time now accessing

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:84%
the energies of your higher self
in your upper chakra systems.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.917 align:middle line:84%
This is why your
thinking has changed.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why a lot
of you are beginning

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to report more paranormal
metaphysical kinds

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of experiences, why you're able
to easily communicate about it,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and why you're connecting
more in a heart-centered way

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The reason your physical reality
has not yet really shifted

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to show all of that work to
you is because a lot of you

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
haven't done that integration
work in your lower chakras.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of you
are running what we

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
would call kind of a
fifth dimensional split

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in your experience, where
your higher self is operating

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the upper chakras, your ego self
or your third dimensional self,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is operating your lower
chakras, and you are not

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
able to effectively co-create
in a fifth dimensional way yet.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's fine.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't see that
as problematic.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
We simply see that
as it is right now.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But in giving you this,
that helps you all remember,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
ah, I can open up
to the energies that

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
exist in my lower
chakras that are

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of a fifth dimensional
vibration and above.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Would that be one of the
reasons why right now we have

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
such polarities going on on the
planet as far as what's going

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
on in the Middle East
and our own government?

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time
you have amazing discoveries,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like there's
so much innovation happening

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:90%
at a super increased rate.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You watch Ted Talks,
or I like to look

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
at the other side
of the newspaper--

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
not the front page
but the back side,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing organic,
sustainable farming,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and restaurants popping up that
are really all about taking

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:90%
care of the environment.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.525 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the other extremes.

00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the
reflection of what's

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.765 align:middle line:84%
going on, because we're
in two different chakras?

00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Or not two different, but--

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Two different
operating systems.

00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Operating systems, I see.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, two different
operating systems.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's part of it.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is, OK, you've got
two different operating systems

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:90%
running your reality right now.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
The other part of it is the
trauma yet to be dealt with.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Every single one
of you have trauma

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
relating to experiences
you had in this incarnation

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and experiences you've
had in every incarnation.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Every incarnation
you've ever had you're

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in the process of accessing
trauma from those lifetimes

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and clearing it.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to your
trauma, the trauma

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
itself causes you
then to play out

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
what appears to be lower
vibrational situations

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of violence, aggression.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all rooted in trauma.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
for you all to get that,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.065 align:middle line:84%
to stop vilifying anyone
on your planet right now,

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:90%
and stop choosing sides.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you choose
a side in any conflict,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
you become part
of that conflict,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
even in your ideology.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
If you sit in your
thoughts and you think,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
all right, we'll use what's
happening in Gaza right now--

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
this may not be relevant when
this airs, but right now it is.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If you say, all right, Israel
is bad in this situation

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and Palestine is good, you are--

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Feeding it.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So instead you've
got to say, I'm

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
going to recognize all the
players as universal beings

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of love and light.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've noticed that
with people asking me,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:90%
what religion are you?

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:90%
And they just get--

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and what political
party are you in?

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed just myself
now consciously just not

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
taking part.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.910 align:middle line:90%
You know, well, it exists.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not denying it.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I get--

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And divide and conquer is
part of the enslavement meme.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to rewrite
your programming there,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can start transcending
the need to choose a side,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
choose a group.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, those groups
were created in part,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
religion or government

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have your
different parties

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
or your different
versions, created in part

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
because you all were feeling so
isolated, separate, and alone.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So you banded together
in these groups

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to feel a deeper
connection to God,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because your understanding was,
God is an energy outside of me.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's band
together and at least

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
be in our separation
from God together.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:10%
So now as you're experiencing
yourselves as source energy,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.477 align:middle line:10%
we don't need those
groups any longer.

00:09:33.477 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not your identity.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:90%
They're not your safety.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to save you.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.243 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
do any of those things.

00:09:39.243 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
You believed-- and sometimes
believed to the extent where

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.185 align:middle line:90%
you would act it out as truth--

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
so it's not that it wasn't
true in those lifetimes,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:90%
it always was.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just no longer the
reality you're playing in.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So scientists have
said even more recently,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
there's more evidence supporting
that we live in a holographic

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get the
Pleiadians' input on this.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if we are truly living
in a holographic universe

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about God or
source or this oneness

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're all part
of, is this universe--

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
how is it a holographic
universe, and how is it--

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is it truly an illusion
like our scientists

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
are even finding out, I'm
sure, through the Pleiadian

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary cycle, they
found similar things.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we'll say
to you about that--

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
this is the 12th dimensional
Pleiadians here--

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
is, yes, it's all an illusion.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:90%
We're an illusion.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We are no more
real than you are.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
You are no more
real than we are.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
However your desire to have
an experience, source's desire

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience, creates
the illusion of reality

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
that becomes real.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
matter that this is

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:90%
all a holographic experience.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what
we're seeing is

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that piece of
information at times

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is being used to empower
you, and then it's also

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:90%
being used to disempower you.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
that you look

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
at when it is you're still being
manipulated by those agencies

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
outside of you that
want you to feel

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:38.488 align:middle line:84%
small, separate,
unimportant, insignificant.

00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how some
of you interpret it

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
when you hear that you're
just a holographic projection

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:90%
of light, which you are.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
You hear "just" instead of
amazing holographic projection

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of light, allowing
itself to imagine

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
it is in third
dimensional density,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
having a real experience
which you are, yes.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Source energy itself transcends
that entire holographic

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:90%
experience and understanding.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So all universes,
all of creation

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
is holographic in its nature.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And obviously the
Pleiadian energy,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians are aware of this, is
there a time when I'm assuming

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:90%
humanity is going to have to--

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
all of humanity is going to
come to this realization.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And then is it like
you just described it?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We all know it, we
all are aware of it,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and we still choose
to play the game?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It will be a part of your
integration and re-ascension

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you fully
integrate this truth,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that you are in a
virtual reality here,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
which is a reality
as well, that simply

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.325 align:middle line:84%
allows you more access to
do more with your reality.

00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Having that information?

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because then
you really get, oh,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just making it
up as I go along.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I really have
integrated that now.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
That allows you then
to begin making up

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:84%
bigger and different
and brighter

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
realities for
yourself, and that's

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
what the fifth dimensionals
have access to.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
fairy realm is like.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
They understand themselves to be
physical protections of light.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
They completely have
integrated that truth,

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
so they play in the physical,
they play in the light body

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
form, they play in both at
once, or they play it out

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
individually and
have a lot of fun

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:90%
in that expression of energy.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
That's where you're headed.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I keep hearing that.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
We are headed towards--

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
in the evolutionary step,
we're heading to the fifth.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.183 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear so much
about the fourth.

00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the fourth?

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There's such a huge
difference in vibration between

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the experience of the third
dimension and the experience

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth that you all needed
the entirety of a dimension,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension, to
operate as a bridge to bring

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness from
the third to the fifth.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So you are currently
inhabiting a fourth dimensional

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You are already operating
as fourth dimensional beings

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
when you come to understand
it's a transitory state

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:90%
to get you to the fifth.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:90%
So it is there.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Because yeah, I hear--

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's here.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>> We're here.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:90%
We're in it.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.163 align:middle line:90%
>> You're in it.

00:14:36.163 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
You're also able to access
full on fifth dimensional

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:90%
experiences right now.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.692 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fourth dimension
is allowing you to transcend

00:14:42.692 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of time and
space that you've been using

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
for eons here in
the third dimension.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's why a lot
of you or all of you

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
are having different
experiences with time

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.805 align:middle line:84%
now than you were a
couple of years ago.

00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, time felt
pretty linear to all of you.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now when you try to
access an event that

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
happened in what you're
calling your past,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
you often can't tell if it
was a day ago, a month ago,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
three years ago, because
you're operating outside

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:90%
of the bounds of linear time.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what the fourth
dimension gives you.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So fourth dimension--

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask you,
so these other dimensions

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:90%
have concepts of time?

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just
surpass time at all?

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a concept of time
still in the fifth and sixth

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:90%
dimensions, yes.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have a
concept of linear time.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
You use time instead to mark
events, moments, experiences,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and then you jump from
moment to moment, experience

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to experience, using time.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's really how you're
operating right now, just

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
through third dimensional.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Mental body doesn't
let you see that's how

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:90%
you're operating right now.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Often you will perceive
that you live your lifetimes

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
in a linear experience.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So you'll say to yourself,
oh, my past lives--

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
you call them past
lives because you

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
believe they happened
at a date that existed

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:90%
prior to this current date.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The truth is you are living all
of those lives concurrently.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You have many
lifetimes, experiences

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:84%
you're living in what you would
call future moments in time.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Just take a breath as you're
processing that piece.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We want all of you listening
to take a breath on that piece.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you begin
to access this truth,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that all of your energy is
incarnate on all of these

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
timelines right now-- and that's
the way we like to frame it,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
these our timelines
that are occurring,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:90%
separate experiences--

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see the
multidimensional nature

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you're here, here,
here, here, here, here, here--

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
you're in all of these places at
once having experiences, being

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:84%
male, being female,
being strong, being weak,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
being a victim, being a villain,
being a hero, heroine, on

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and on and on, being an
earthling, being a Pleiadian,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
being a third dimensional,
being a 10th dimension-- right.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:90%
You're all of it right now.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
As you're integrating your
higher self and re-ascending

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth, you're
beginning to gain

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
all of the data that's stored
from all of those experiences

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:90%
that are currently happening.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
You're also, as you're gaining
access to those experiences,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:90%
able to alter those experiences.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just integrating
your higher selves right now

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and re-ascending in this moment.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Every version of you
that has ever existed

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle line:84%
is also integrating its
higher self and re-ascending.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
You are in the process of
creating a new universe.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Well you can only do
that as a hologram.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which I
was going to ask.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we're
changing time.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
If we were to go back
in time right now

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and see the past
lives, as opposed

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to if we went back in
time yesterday and saw

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
those past lives, it would
be a different experience?

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct, yes.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And because you have
altered your consciousness

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
since yesterday, you wouldn't
recognize the difference.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
What you would have accessed
yesterday no longer exists.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's happening for
all of you right now.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.172 align:middle line:84%
You used to tell a particular
story about your past.

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You now tell different
stories about your past.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know that you're
telling a different story

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
about your past because
you no longer are

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the version of you that
was telling the other story

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.362 align:middle line:90%
about your past, yes.

00:18:35.362 --> 00:18:37.705 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, when
you get into that--

00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Nora laughing here.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.132 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I just
have to break out.

00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it gets to the point
where anything is possible.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's just light.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> In that case, it's just a
hologram that is just being

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
repurposed to serve
our purpose, right,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:90%
when we're out in the moment.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is the
Pleiadians here.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We want to talk about,
again, this word "hologram,"

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:84%
because every time you
hear it, you're all going

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:90%
to get triggered right now.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what you see is,
ah, I'm a physical body.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm real.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.415 align:middle line:84%
I can pinch myself,
and it hurts.

00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm awake.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So this means somehow then
I have more value than that

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
projection of light
that scientists created.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
That's how you perceive
holograms right now.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Your experience with them
only has been in a lab

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
or in film or TV.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> When we go to movies.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
that's not real.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The actor is real,
the hologram is fake.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It's made up by the scientist.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:90%
You are not real.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You're made up by your
higher self, which

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
is made up by your
oversoul, which

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:90%
is made up by source energy.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, yes,
you're as real as you can be.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
yourselves as holographic,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
you must see yourselves also as
an expression of source energy,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
universal beings
of love and light

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
here playing with other
universal beings of love

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.532 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Then it doesn't matter
what you call yourselves

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
or what you are.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of that
can be a big head game.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And science can be
very intellectual,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:84%
as you know, and often
discounts the emotional body

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:90%
in its findings and discoveries.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves out a
big chunk of information.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Because then you're just
talking about the physical

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
light energy of the hologram and
not the other energies that go

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
along with it.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the
consciousness attached.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Which may not be visually
there, but it's there.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, as music is there.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to music,
it's not visually there,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:90%
but it's there.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
You're present with it.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And no movie is complete
without its soundtrack.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.827 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:20:59.827 --> 00:21:00.627 align:middle line:90%
I guess that--

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Nora laughing again.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just sharing
my process with you.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, you
know, this is how--

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy for me now to
go from Nora to the Pleiadians,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It didn't used to
be this way for me.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's good you
can observe and laugh

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
at the conversation at
the appropriate times.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I get to.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.772 align:middle line:84%
I feel happy that
I get to do that.

00:21:24.772 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't used to do it.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Initially, when I channeled in
the beginning, for many years

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I had my eyes closed.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, Nora was
very in the background

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and they were very center,
and it took a lot of my energy

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
to bring that
information through,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
partly because collective
humanity and Earth's vibration

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
in tandem were at
a much lower place.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So I had to work
really, really hard

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to access those
higher vibrations.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, collectively, we're in
such a high space together,

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:90%
it's so easy to connect.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So does that mean
there's hope for humanity,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that we will all be able to
access this at some point?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Yeshua.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Greetings.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
We greet you with love and joy
and honor the being of light

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has
already re-ascended.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's already occurred.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You are just making
your way to that moment

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that you have
already co-created.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
When you say "then there's
hope for humanity," what you're

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
expressing there, Reuben, and
we'll talk directly to you,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is at times the
sorrow you feel when

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
you look at the current
reality and conditions.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It is extremely
important that all of you

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
give yourselves
permission to access

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
those feelings of sadness,
sorrow, grief, loss,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
but to not get stuck in them.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We want you to feel
the reality around you.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Then we want you to run the
experience of compassion

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and unconditional
love for all who

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.140 align:middle line:84%
choose to be in that
kind of experience,

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and then go back to
your internal work.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Will do, thank you.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I got thrown off
for a minute there.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Yeshua-- this is Nora.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The Yeshua is very different
from the Pleiadian, yes.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
When I channel
the Yeshua energy,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if that transmission
is coming directly through

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
my heart center, even though my
mouth is moving and the words--

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:90%
it feels to me--

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians,
more of my chakras

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
seem to be involved
with the Pleiadians.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:90%
With Yeshua, it's this poof.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well, it's assuring.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It's good to know--
and I feel it too.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel definitely
that every time I

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.316 align:middle line:84%
have a vision of the future,
I see "Star Trek," so--

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:11.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I see the spaceships
flying around and having these

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:90%
cool experiences.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't see the apocalyptic--

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
one time I did see the
dark Terminator or this--

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Mad Max.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> --Mad Max kind of apocalyptic
future, and I'm like, oh,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
we're all doomed.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.908 align:middle line:84%
But I can't even go
watch those movies

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:90%
or do that kind of thing.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Zombie movies, it
doesn't resonate.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't even sit through
another zombie movie

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.488 align:middle line:90%
probably ever again.

00:24:39.488 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the Pleiadians here.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.615 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when
you watch something

00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
like "Star Trek" or "Star
Wars," what you're really

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
looking at in a lot of ways are
records of galactic history.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Those are experiences
you all have had,

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
because those are all very
third dimensional experiences.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What you are taking
yourselves to

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
in a fifth dimensional reality
looks nothing like that.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that was, I guess,
going to be my question was,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:90%
what is the fifth dimension?

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
beings who I know can--

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
getting back to the reality
thing, the whole illusion,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
once you wake up
from the illusion

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and once you're able
to create instantly,

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
as described in the fifth
dimensional process, or beings

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
in that dimension that
can kind of imagine it

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and there it is, much
like a dream state--

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Greetings, this
is Calliandra.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm Calliandra, a fifth
dimensional fairy.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
We in the fifth dimension
are currently transitioning

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:90%
into sixth dimensional form.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So as you re-ascend
here, we go there.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
answer your question.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's very much like
what you depicted there,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
as you were dreaming
and imagining

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:90%
about it yourself, Reuben.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
We create, delete, create,
delete, create, delete.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not like "Star Trek."

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:10%
In "Star Trek"--

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:10%
>> That's 3D.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you get in a ship
to get to another place,

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
or you use technology to
allow you to teleport.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to use something
physical to alter

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:90%
your physical experience.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension, we fire
up our fifth dimensional chakra

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
systems to take us to
where it is we want to go,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to move us from here to
there, to manifest at will.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We also know ourselves
to be light bodies who

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:90%
can use a physical expression.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You do not fully know yourselves
to be there on planet Earth.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:90%
You know it intellectually.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Intellectually you
understand, my physical body

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
is a projection
of my light body.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know it yet
in your lower chakras,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
because if you had integrated
that in your lower chakras,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you would be altering your
reality at will, as we are.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
That is fifth
dimensional reality.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of these
masters of, like,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.745 align:middle line:84%
qigong or these people
who defy physics,

00:27:17.745 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:84%
are they more in the fifth
dimensional frequencies?

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> They are accessing those
fifth dimensional abilities

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
because of the deeper
integration process

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in the lower chakras, yes.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Also because they
have worked diligently

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
at unplugging from their third
dimensional mental bodies.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
preventer for you as well.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
two things going on.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:84%
You've got the integration
experience going

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
into your lower chakras,
your higher self more fully

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:84%
inhabiting chakras
one, two, and three.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the third
dimensional mental body

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
filtering out.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to come
through your heart center.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So a qigong master
will completely

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
operate from the
heart as the center.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The mind no longer
exists in that moment,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and that allows him to access
his fifth dimensional identity

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
within chakras one,
two, and three, that

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:84%
allow him to alter
physical reality in a way

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that it looks like you can't as
third dimensional beings, yes.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Defining the physics that
we kind of think is real.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What Nora was
receiving there,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
we want to give this to you, is
our transmission is even more

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
difficult for her to receive
today than it was a couple

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of years ago because you
are nearing our vibration,

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
which means it's a
vibrational telepathic match,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
which is very unfamiliar to
all of you on your world.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:90%
This is Nora.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're accessing our
telepathic abilities.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're all telepathic.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whether we're
conscious of it or not,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly
receiving that input

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
from the people in
the world around us,

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and we've spent a lot
of time tuning it out.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting
to, as we release

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
those filters in
our mental body,

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
be able to have that telepathic
connection with those

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.733 align:middle line:84%
So what Calliandra
is explaining to me

00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is it's becoming that way
with the fifth dimensionals,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning our third
dimensional minds

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:84%
are getting in the way of
fifth dimensional telepathic

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
transmissions right now, because
the third dimensional mind

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing it as a vibration
that's very similar to our own.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's wanting to
filter it out in a way

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's not filtering out the
higher vibrational information.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I kind of see.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I kind of see as well.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.965 align:middle line:84%
See, this is a new piece
of information to me,

00:29:39.965 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's something I've
been wondering about,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
because over the
last year or so,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I have noticed that Calliandra's
energy feels denser and denser

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:90%
to me, harder for me to access.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And I had wondered why that was.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:10%
I can see that.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering
about other beings who--

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, let's get
back to "Star Trek."

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a huge "Star Trek"
fan, so I'm happy to get back

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to "Star Trek."

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it gives it a
place of context for people

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to relate to, because
everybody knows "Star Trek,"

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a big fan of it as well.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:30.057 align:middle line:84%
But the beings who are on
a physical third dimension,

00:30:30.057 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:84%
based on my experience and
research and all of the stuff

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that's been going
on, a lot, some,

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:84%
of the beings from the Zeta
Reticuli tend to be more

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:84%
of a third dimensional
vibration in the sense that

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:84%
they're actually taking--
they're on ships,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
they're taking us,
they're doing stuff,

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
they also seem to be
very highly telepathic,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and also still more evolved
because they're able to jump

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:84%
dimensions and travel
through these--

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:90%
interdimensionally.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the abilities
to travel interdimensionally,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily make
you a fifth dimensional being.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.213 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:31:14.213 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:90%
This is the Pleiadians here.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
No, what you've done
is you've accessed

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:84%
fourth and fifth
dimensional technologies

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:90%
in an external way.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
What you're all doing is
accessing those technologies

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You're altering your
operating systems.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So on Atlantis, you
had two factions.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You had the group
of you who wanted

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to access those operating
systems internally

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.175 align:middle line:84%
and believed that
was the right way.

00:31:39.175 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you had
the group of you

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that wanted to access
those technologies

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and external systems,
and they believed

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
that was the right way.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the polarity in the belief
split the male and female

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
energy down the middle and
destroyed the continent.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.842 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
simplified explanation

00:31:55.842 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
of what happened on Atlantis.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:84%
There were many other things
that came into play there.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.302 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you're
talking about there.

00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So the Zetas mastered the laws
of third dimensional physics

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago and
transcended them

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
into playing with the laws of
fourth and fifth dimensional

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.140 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Their intellect expanded in
part because they shut off

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:90%
their emotional bodies.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Zetas became
a group of species

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
who began to value the
intellectual experience

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
reality, which allowed them

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:90%
to go much farther in their--

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Third dimensional.

00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:33.575 align:middle line:90%
>> --mental understanding.

00:32:33.575 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And then they could create.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They could use their third
dimensional minds to create

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:84%
vehicles and technology that
would allow them to do these

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:90%
things that you cannot.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:84%
What they lost was the
ability to procreate.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
What they lost was the
ability to run compassion,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:84%
empathy, or have any kind
of emotional connection.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
As they lost the
ability to procreate,

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.500 align:middle line:84%
it became necessary for them
to begin cloning their species.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they
did for quite a time.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And then their species
began to die off,

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because you can only copy
something so many times

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:90%
before it breaks down.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So then the agreement was
reached with many of you

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth to begin
the hybridization program,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.803 align:middle line:84%
to help the Zetas
repopulate their species.

00:33:17.803 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But they knew it was going
to be a different version

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Zeta.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now what's occurred recently,
just over the last decade

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
or so, is many of
the Zetas have begun

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to switch on their
emotional bodies again,

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
in reaction to interacting
with all of the earthlings,

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:84%
but also interacting
with the hybrids.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It's become necessary
for the Zetas as a whole

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to switch on their
emotional bodies

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to interact
with their children.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And as they've
done that, they've

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:84%
come to a deeper
understanding of what looks--

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:90%
and we say looks like--

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the damage they
caused here on Earth,

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
here with those who have
experienced what they refer to

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:90%
as abductions.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, truly nobody
was ever abducted

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:84%
because anybody who
got aboard a ship,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
paralyzed and taken aboard

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
or willingly went aboard
on some level said,

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.440 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'd like to have that
experience before incarnating

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:84%
their higher self,
sign them up, in part

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:84%
because they perceived
the Zetas to be family--

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:29.840 align:middle line:84%
meaning that higher self
also had experiences as Zeta.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But more often than not, those
of you who had the experience

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:84%
on Earth-- or we'll say
many of you, at least--

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
experienced it in a
negative connotation

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and are still playing out some
trauma from those experiences.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:84%
>> That definitely fills in
a lot of holes for me with

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
questions in regard
to the Zetas.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons why
I've always wondered why they

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:90%
haven't--

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.927 align:middle line:84%
if they're in the
third dimension,

00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
why haven't they
been able to advance

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to the fifth, fourth
or fifth, or maybe

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of in the middle.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So just to kind of
reiterate, technologically

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:84%
they can jump through
wormholes and do all this stuff

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because they've
advanced intellectually.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But spiritually,
they haven't been

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
able to go into the
light being bodies

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because they lack
some of the programs.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they shut down
their emotional experience.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So the integration process is
an extremely emotional process.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we as humans have
more range there.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we choose to jump
the intellectual stage

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and go past "Star Trek"
into a new completely--

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --a new realm of, more of--

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You've not seen it
in your films or on TV.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:90%
You've not yet seen it.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps at times there have
been depictions of fairies--

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
not little winged beings,
full-on fairy beings--

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that can hold a human
projection but then

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:90%
also hold light body form.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:90%
There have been some of that.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You've seen some of it even
in your "Star Trek" series.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Nora is giving us
this information.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is also how we work.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.503 align:middle line:84%
If there are pieces
that we need filled in

00:36:21.503 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to help you all
better understand,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll data mine through
Nora's memory banks

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and pull out particular pieces.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So there have been-- perhaps not
in "Stargate," something else--

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:84%
"Stargate" TV show, examples
of higher dimensional beings

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.413 align:middle line:84%
interacting with their
dimensional beings,

00:36:41.413 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and you've seen those kinds
of beings, those light beings,

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and what they're capable of.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have seen that
expression of energy,

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:84%
but not the majority
of your sci-fi.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:10%
The majority of
your sci-fi is still

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:10%
couching it in a third
dimensional experience.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.830 align:middle line:10%
>> And so getting
back to the Zetas,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of times they're
working with other species.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:84%
The labels we give them
are Nordics, or maybe even

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadians.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.982 align:middle line:84%
>> So intellectually they know
they're lacking this emotional

00:37:16.982 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:84%
things, so that's why the whole
hybridization program comes

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:19.710 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the Pleiadians.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And also for a long
time they didn't

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.485 align:middle line:84%
care because they didn't have
an emotional body to care.

00:37:25.485 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, OK.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a benefit because
in using their mental bodies

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.970 align:middle line:90%
as they did, it's--

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
so we've got to talk
about law of attraction

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
here for you to really
understand this, all of you.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So in the third dimension,
you use law of attraction

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:90%
to manifest your realities.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:84%
When you're running
an emotional body,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:84%
it's your emotions that bring
your reality to you, not

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.340 align:middle line:90%
your minds.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can think and affirm all
you want, I am rich, I am rich,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I am rich.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But without the
emotional content--

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes sense.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So your emotional body is
always going to take you back

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:90%
to exactly--

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to show you exactly
how you feel in your world.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I always wondered that
because when I was little,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:84%
my parents used to punish me
and make me write affirmations

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:90%
on a paper, right--

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I will not, you
know, do something

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.237 align:middle line:90%
if I did something bad.

00:38:16.237 --> 00:38:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I used to cheat,
and I would just write,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I, I, I. No emotional content.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I was just writing letters.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It was just an exercise in
writing really at that point,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and giving you a time out
and giving you a chore.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So for all of you on Earth, you
are using your emotional bodies

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:84%
as the fuel to manifest
your realities.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And it greatly often has
slowed down what it is

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
your mental bodies have
wanted to experience.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reality
you're in, and you enjoy it.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.990 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy using your
emotions to attract.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The Zetas realized, if they
wanted to really have those

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensional experiences,
they were going to have to shut

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.520 align:middle line:84%
off their emotional bodies to
run law of attraction based

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:90%
clearly on their mental bodies.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So the Zetas are different
from you in this way,

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
or at least were
different from you

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in this way as well,
in that they're still

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.723 align:middle line:84%
running law of attraction,
but their mental bodies

00:39:16.723 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:90%
are running the show.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You are using law of attraction
here in the third dimension,

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and your emotional bodies
are running the show now.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension,
Calliandra and her pack,

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, all of those
fifth dimensionals-- they

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.710 align:middle line:90%
don't manifest using emotion.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They manifest using
vibration and frequency.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
They use their light body,
their energetic body,

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:90%
to instantaneously manifest.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the direction
you're headed.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
What you are bringing
to the fifth dimension

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is an emotional understanding
of the manifestation process.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.432 align:middle line:84%
That hasn't existed in
the fifth dimension?

00:39:55.432 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.997 align:middle line:84%
>> The fifth dimension, in
many respects, is quite a mess.

00:40:00.997 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when you can
create and delete

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
at will with no
consequence, because you

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.675 align:middle line:90%
know yourself to be--

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:07.925 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just going to happen--

00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:84%
You can blow up and recreate
and blow up and recreate,

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's gotten
very old and tired

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and has spun out a lot
of karmic realities

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:90%
that now need to be cleaned up.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So as you all bring
to the fifth dimension

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:84%
this compassion and empathy,
which you have finally

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:35.420 align:middle line:84%
honed with your emotional
experience in the third.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You're not just going
to create and delete

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.657 align:middle line:90%
at will because you can.

00:40:39.657 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we like to say
to you on planet Earth,

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.157 align:middle line:84%
just because you can, it doesn't
mean it's for your highest good

00:40:44.157 --> 00:40:45.150 align:middle line:90%
to do so.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And you get that
on planet Earth.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimensionals
don't get it.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
"for my highest

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.855 align:middle line:84%
good," because they don't
have that emotional context.

00:40:54.855 --> 00:40:57.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they
don't have emotions.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They still feel.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But they don't use their
emotions to manifest.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They will have a feeling
about what it is they created

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.910 align:middle line:90%
or what it is they destroyed.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But then because
they can redo it,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really sink
in, yes, in the way

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.495 align:middle line:90%
that that does for all of you.

00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.223 align:middle line:84%
Can't wait to go to
the fifth dimension.

00:41:22.223 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Bring in the emotion.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So when, for example,
Calliandra is

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.020 align:middle line:84%
moving into the sixth
dimension, and I'm

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
sure they're bringing in a whole
new skill set that didn't exist

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
in that sixth dimension
before, just as if we're

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.942 align:middle line:84%
bringing in the emotional set,
what is it they're bringing?

00:41:40.942 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just way beyond our
comprehension at this point?

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so glad you asked
that question, because yes,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.460 align:middle line:84%
this is Nora here, I have tried
to access specific details

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:84%
about the sixth dimension,
and I've not been able to.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I can access specific details
about the 12th dimension,

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.190 align:middle line:90%
the ninth, 10th, 11th, seventh.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:90%
The sixth is a mystery to me.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the Pleiadians, and
we'll leave it at that for now.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It's information that would
distract you right now.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood, yeah.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.267 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I probably thought,
even if you add it,

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.520 align:middle line:84%
it's probably not even
going to come-- you know,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.931 align:middle line:84%
our monkey minds can't
figure that out right now.

00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You knew it.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:84%
As you asked the question,
you knew the answer.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's cool to be different--

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to have like--

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I feel yeah, human
race, bringing in the emotion.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Fifth dimension, yeah.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.810 align:middle line:90%
We're doing something.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, this is the Pleiadians.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it helps you to
understand your value.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to
really see yourselves

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
this universal shift.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is an entire universal
shift that's underway.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:59.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it just earth
that's part of this third,

00:42:59.227 --> 00:43:00.310 align:middle line:90%
fifth dimensional process?

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Or are there other planets in--

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just earth that's having
this specific experience right

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:84%
now of a collective species
and a planet itself integrating

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and re-ascending at once.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
However, as you do that,
you offer that information

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and technology then to
all else in the universe.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Then it becomes
a universal game,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and it has become
a universal game.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that kind of puts us on
the universal map, so to say?

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
You are the greatest show
right now in the universe,

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's why you've got so
many lights in your sky.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this from
many different areas.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth is, I assume, kind
of under a quarantine right now

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
for other energies, negative
energies that would want to--

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The quarantine was lifted.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:43:59.547 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean exactly?

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's occurring now is--
the quarantine was lifted back

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.020 align:middle line:90%
around at some point in 2012.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you explain both
what the quarantine is and--

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So the quarantine allowed
you all to have your experience

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:90%
in a somewhat private manner.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that all
other ETs in the universe

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.023 align:middle line:84%
were prevented
from accessing you.

00:44:25.023 --> 00:44:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is like
the "Star Trek"

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:84%
prime directive where
the free will and not--

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So observing could
occur, and then

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:84%
those who are intrinsically
karmically interconnected

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:90%
with you could interact.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.382 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians, the
Zetas, the Lyrans, on and on.

00:44:43.382 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Beings that help make
up our genetic makeup.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And/or with the
hybridization program.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But the Zetas are really
your ancestors as well.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.720 align:middle line:90%
They're in your DNA as well.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they were allowed
direct access because

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:90%
of the karmic relationships.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We could not fulfill
our karmic experience--

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%
so we're speaking for
all Pleiadian life

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:84%
right now when we say
"we" on any dimension--

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:84%
without being able to
interact with the earthlings.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyone outside of those auspices
were not allowed direct access,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:84%
but there was still
the ability to observe.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
were hidden from view.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:90%
You were always there.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But most of the universe
forgot in a lot of ways

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that you existed for a long
time because they were not

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:31.760 align:middle line:90%
allowed direct access.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So what was the point of
knowing Earth existed?

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So when the
quarantine was lifted,

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
it's not like a big announcement
was made across the universe.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
No trumpets sounded saying
earth is open for business.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It was very quietly released.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.360 align:middle line:90%
And this was just a few years.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:49.162 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're having more and
more lights in your sky now

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:84%
because that information
has been made available.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, we can interact.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But most of the beings who
desire to interact with you

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:84%
or are thinking about
having an interaction

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.620 align:middle line:90%
don't want to disrupt.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's why you're
having lights in the sky

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.850 align:middle line:84%
but not too many
experiences on the ground.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Because if they
were to interact,

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.830 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't it alter
the whole process?

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and it would generate
a tremendous amount of fear.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:90%
This is Nora.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I always-- I want to talk
about that personally,

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
because I hear that piece,
and I know it to be true.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.304 align:middle line:84%
And then I also think,
oh, come on, really?

00:46:35.304 --> 00:46:37.346 align:middle line:84%
>> That was exactly the
thing I was thinking too.

00:46:37.346 --> 00:46:38.813 align:middle line:90%
I was like, come on, I've been--

00:46:38.813 --> 00:46:39.980 align:middle line:90%
you know, I've been in this.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.518 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time, yeah.

00:46:41.518 --> 00:46:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know if I've
shared my Calliandra story with

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:44.860 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But I was sitting on the
couch one night watching TV,

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
corner of my eye, I

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:52.880 align:middle line:84%
saw a portal rip open
over my dining room table.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, I don't mean saw it
in my mind's eye, I mean,

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
like a zipper light was--
it unzipped and opened

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:90%
above my dining room table.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And Calliandra stepped through
in full physical light body

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.130 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
She was about 10 feet tall, and
I became paralyzed with fear.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I was on the couch
going holy, like--

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and Calliandra is a being
that I know and love

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and have channeled.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But her physical presence
sent so much fear

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:84%
through my central
nervous system

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that I believe the
Pleiadians when

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
they say it would
generate too much fear.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my emotional body and my
mental body could handle it,

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.980 align:middle line:84%
but my physical body
could not handle right now

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.390 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of ships landing
and ET getting off.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Our US government can't--

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, with sending fighter
jets over every thing that

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.800 align:middle line:84%
could possibly show
up in the sky seems

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to not be able to handle
that right now either, so--

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are those select few--

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
say select few--

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
who are fully aware of the
truth of ET interactions.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And those numbers are much
smaller than most of you

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.440 align:middle line:90%
can imagine.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of you think once you're
in the government you're in.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.690 align:middle line:90%
We would say, no, not at all.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Not hardly at all.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at how desperate most
of your politicians act.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.350 align:middle line:84%
That desperation right there
lets you know they're not in.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, absolutely.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I produced the Citizens'
Hearing on Disclosure last year,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and we actually talked
straight to Congress members

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and had former Congress members.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But they clearly stated
that in a lot of that stuff

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.750 align:middle line:90%
they're not in the need to know.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.270 align:middle line:90%
And so is the president.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We were just
going to say that.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Obama, your current president,
does not know what others know.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:50.510 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems as
the presidents go,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:middle line:84%
less and less information
is being revealed.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> We would agree.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.308 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this point,
they're really

00:48:57.308 --> 00:49:01.220 align:middle line:84%
being used, your presidents and
your figureheads, to manipulate

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and divide.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:90%
They're being used as puppets.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.920 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot of you feel
intense disappointment

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.100 align:middle line:84%
at times in what your
current president has done,

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.230 align:middle line:84%
no matter which side
of the party you're on.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And we want to say
he's not there really

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:90%
anymore to do anything.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
unfortunate reality but,

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.610 align:middle line:84%
it's just time
for those systems,

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:23.470 align:middle line:84%
like you mentioned
earlier, to collapse.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is where you
can either distract yourself

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and feel frustrated and
afraid and powerless,

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:84%
or you can go to your own
internal operating system.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Integrate your higher
self more deeply,

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.880 align:middle line:84%
begin to operate as a sovereign
universal being of light right

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
now in your own lives,
right now in your own lives.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
time now to begin

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:49.640 align:middle line:84%
to back up with physical action
that which you have integrated

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:84%
mentally, emotionally, and
energetically this is the time.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:59.855 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the message that
I keep coming back to every day

00:49:59.855 --> 00:50:02.480 align:middle line:84%
through my everyday interactions
with life, through government,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.710 align:middle line:90%
through all this stuff.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about really claiming
that power of who we are

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and not being part of this
illusion that we're in--

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to do this and that
and work and all this stuff.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:19.457 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is Nora here.

00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're still operating
with a system of money.

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'll use my
own personal experience,

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm still working--

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I put that in quotation marks.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm channeling all the
time and doing healing work.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:90%
That's my work.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.877 align:middle line:84%
And even throughout the
course of my work as a healer,

00:50:35.877 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:90%
things have changed.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:10%
So when I started channeling
I was waitressing tables,

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:45.320 align:middle line:10%
and I had been acting
in Chicago and directed.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
that was my past, that I

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:90%
was going to be an actress.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And then I established
contact with my guide Mirando

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:10%
when I was 29.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:10%
And that transmission
of love was

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:10%
so intense and powerful
that it took me

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.730 align:middle line:10%
in a completely
different direction

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:10%
in opening up my heart and
accessing my own higher

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.010 align:middle line:10%
self and all the other
beings that I work with.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
I'll still act,

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and also I'll get
this experience.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But while acting I was running
a lot of survival issues.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I was constantly
accessing my own feelings

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:25.520 align:middle line:84%
about rejection and not being
good enough and body issues,

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and constantly looking for work.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The survival issues--
yeah, that those--

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.395 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the number one job
of the actor is finding a job.

00:51:34.395 --> 00:51:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, yeah.

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Even while you're
in a job, you are

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
aware that you are going
to have to, at some point,

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:90%
find another job.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And often-- and that was
really wearing on me.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, Mirando,
my guide, said to me,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.072 align:middle line:84%
you're not just channeling
for you and your friends.

00:51:52.072 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You're channeling because this
is what you came here to do.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.490 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're going to do.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And hearing that
even, I said, no.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not, uh uh.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:90%
No, thank you.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a lot of nos there.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, a lot of lifetimes
of being burned as a witch

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and dragged through the
streets of Scotland by my hair,

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:19.140 align:middle line:84%
tortured, raped, and
murdered, and on and on.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But then also just, I didn't
mind being weird or different.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It was never that.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I like being
weird and different.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So that was always fine by me.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It was the idea of interacting
with so many people on such

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.060 align:middle line:84%
an intimate level, I think,
was overwhelming to me.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I was young.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I was 30 at the time as I was
receiving that information.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.107 align:middle line:84%
And then the restaurant I'd
worked at for 10 years closed.

00:52:43.107 --> 00:52:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And they called us all in,
and they said, we're closing.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And my guide said, OK,
time now to go be you.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went and worked in another
restaurant for two weeks,

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
tolerate it in my body.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first, first
step in freeing myself when

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.410 align:middle line:90%
it comes to my survival issues.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:08.030 align:middle line:84%
My body could no longer tolerate
being in that particular system

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of enslavement.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, OK, I'm
going to serve in this way.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And I worked for
others initially.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I worked at
metaphysical bookstores.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I worked at private parties.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I worked for anyone
I could work for.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really see myself
as working for myself.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So I had taken myself out of
doing something I didn't really

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.167 align:middle line:84%
want to be doing and
working for somebody else

00:53:30.167 --> 00:53:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to doing what I wanted
to be doing but still

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:90%
working for myself.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I continued to receive
nudges and guidance, OK, time

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.620 align:middle line:84%
to quit the bookstores and
just do private sessions.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.760 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't have the
money to do that.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Do it, and you'll have
the money to do that.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So I was constantly running this
kind of test subject experience

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.350 align:middle line:84%
on myself when it
comes to manifestation

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and creating my reality
of giving myself

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.890 align:middle line:84%
the experience I wanted to have
before I really had the money

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:90%
to have that experience.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And as I've done
that over the years

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and continued to change and
shift and alter again and again

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and again [INAUDIBLE],,
where I work,

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:14.910 align:middle line:84%
how I work, how many days a week
I work-- and it's still work,

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in the system of work.

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But I am also aware of my own
evolutionary process here,

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and I know I will and we all
on Earth will get to the point

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:28.670 align:middle line:84%
where we no longer
perceive that what we do

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is work, because
it's supporting us.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It will simply be what we do,
how we exist, how we interact,

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and we will feel supported,
nurtured, and loved

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and manifest the truth of that.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the Pleiadians--
and that's really

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.155 align:middle line:90%
what you're already doing.

00:54:45.155 --> 00:54:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's something else.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Money, really, has been
very useful for all of you.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It's allowed you to
exist on linear time.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were manifesting
instantaneously your desires

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.650 align:middle line:90%
without the need for money--

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:05.240 align:middle line:84%
so if you could say, I want
a meal, there's a meal,

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.392 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in
Mexico, I'm in Mexico--

00:55:07.392 --> 00:55:09.350 align:middle line:84%
you're transcending the
laws of time and space.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:10.195 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:55:10.195 --> 00:55:11.320 align:middle line:90%
So you put money in place--

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> That's fifth
dimensional stuff, yeah.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.025 align:middle line:84%
You put money in
place to help keep you

00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:16.040 align:middle line:84%
on that linear line
of time where you're

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:20.000 align:middle line:84%
plodding along, making the
money to have what you want,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.300 align:middle line:90%
working to pay your bills.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That's all very much in
alignment with linear time.

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So as you transcend
linear time completely,

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.617 align:middle line:84%
you're going to transcend
the system of money.

00:55:31.617 --> 00:55:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What comes first?

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:34.242 align:middle line:84%
Transition of time, or
transition of money?

00:55:34.242 --> 00:55:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We would say both
happen at the same time.

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.951 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.951 --> 00:55:39.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've always-- I've
taken this look at it

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:50.778 align:middle line:84%
or approach or view, is
that nature in itself,

00:55:50.778 --> 00:55:52.070 align:middle line:90%
there's a place for everything.

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, the birds
eat the insects,

00:55:55.250 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
the insects eat the plants,
you know, and it trickles down.

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
whole kind of place

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.670 align:middle line:90%
for everything within nature.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've always told other
people that human nature too,

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.960 align:middle line:90%
we all--

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.320 align:middle line:84%
nature has a way of creating
the right proportion of males

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.790 align:middle line:90%
and females on the planet.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Nature has a way of giving us
the direction and knowledge

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and intention.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to jobs,
we'll all be just right,

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:84%
so we're all doing
exactly what we

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:33.420 align:middle line:84%
love to do and still live in
perfect harmony without money--

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --if we just have to
listen to our natural nature.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.830 align:middle line:90%
This is the Pleiadians here.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you'll evolve
into the third dimension,

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.710 align:middle line:84%
in that format as you're
also continuing to integrate

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and re-ascend to the fifth
dimension, where money really

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:53.540 align:middle line:84%
serves no purpose whatsoever,
other than you might decide

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to create some because you want
to throw some money around,

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.850 align:middle line:84%
just to have the experience
literally of throwing-- this

00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.650 align:middle line:90%
is Nora.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Calliandra is showing me.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Calliandra is just
like, I can make money.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.600 align:middle line:90%
She just made all this money.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.028 align:middle line:84%
So I clairvoyantly saw
her make all this money

00:57:08.028 --> 00:57:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and then just throw
it like confetti.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, to her, that's
the purpose of money.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.374 align:middle line:90%
It's paper to throw around.

00:57:14.374 --> 00:57:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, just before we
close, I understand

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:26.530 align:middle line:84%
we're evolving into
a fifth dimension.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, is this something-- and I'm
sure people watching this too--

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:34.825 align:middle line:84%
is this something that is
going to be taken over time?

00:57:34.825 --> 00:57:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Or is this something that--

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't tell you
when the finish line is,

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.170 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
probabilities in this moment.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So some of you may
experience this

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.165 align:middle line:84%
during this physical
incarnation, some of you

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:49.965 align:middle line:90%
may not.

00:57:49.965 --> 00:57:50.800 align:middle line:90%
None of you may.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.000 align:middle line:90%
All of you may.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.330 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't matter.

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:57.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I get it.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.720 align:middle line:10%
>> But we understand
the question.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say this, you will
experience it, of course.

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're incarnate
here right now having

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:11.015 align:middle line:84%
this experience, you can bet
if you don't finish it out

00:58:11.015 --> 00:58:12.390 align:middle line:84%
in this incarnation,
you're going

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.680 align:middle line:84%
to jump right back
in and continue on.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And you won't jump back
in where you came in

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.920 align:middle line:90%
in this incarnation.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You'll jump right back in
right where you left off.

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.937 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that
was the question,

00:58:22.937 --> 00:58:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is because sometimes
from the sounds of it,

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.150 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like are
we just going to zap

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:30.218 align:middle line:90%
into another reality from this?

00:58:30.218 --> 00:58:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Is this going to stop existing?

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually it's going
to feel that way, yes.

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And just like we said
earlier, then you

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.130 align:middle line:90%
will be a new version of you.

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:43.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll no longer be able to
reference this as your past.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You'll experience it perhaps
as a quote unquote past life,

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:49.420 align:middle line:84%
but within the
incarnational cycle,

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.060 align:middle line:84%
if you do it while
incarnate, which all of you

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.520 align:middle line:84%
will when you do
it, you will see it

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:84%
as two separate completely
versions of yourself, reality,

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.850 align:middle line:84%
because there is that tipping
point, that moment where

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:03.770 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you are a
fifth dimensional.

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that state,
we're more aware--

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.450 align:middle line:84%
like, just now,
people are becoming

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:16.360 align:middle line:84%
more aware of their past lives
and having these experiences.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:22.180 align:middle line:84%
As we move up the evolutionary
chain of dimensions

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.028 align:middle line:90%
or evolution, will we--

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:27.070 align:middle line:84%
obviously we don't have
access to that knowledge,

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but will we actually
be able to, I

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.660 align:middle line:84%
guess what I'm trying to say
is, maybe live multiple lives

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.480 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Can we go--

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll know that you're
living multiple lives at-- you

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:38.900 align:middle line:84%
already are living multiple
lives at the same time.

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll have the consciousness
to support that knowledge.

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Without it frying our brains?

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because you won't have
the same brain you have right

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:48.832 align:middle line:90%
now, yes.

00:59:48.832 --> 00:59:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll have,
like, a light brain.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:55.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll just be
consciousness, understanding

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.910 align:middle line:90%
all of its experience, yes.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> All the experiences.

00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you very much.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:05.980 align:middle line:84%
This has been a very
honorable conversation,

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and to all the beings that came
through and spent time with us

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:11.750 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And a special
thanks to you, Nora,

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:16.148 align:middle line:90%
for offering this experience.

01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the Pleiadians here.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll speak for all
who participated.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.740 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We love you, Reuben.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And we love all
of you listening.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is Nora.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I love you, Reuben.

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I do, I'm very grateful to you.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
