00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:08.964 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, over the years, we have
spoken so many times about this

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:10%
idea about contact
being, most importantly,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:10%
on the inner level.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And we would still
say that is true.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
However you are physical beings.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And so let us say
that last night was

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
an example of
beginning to integrate

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
the physical and
non-physical realms.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
idea of contact,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of starting with
physical realm first,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get very far
as a species first initiating

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
contact, because then the
ego attaches to the external

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and the story is
over, basically.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you
doing the very deep work,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
you have, let's say,
paved a road within you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
where you know now that road
of contact as it leads inward.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's, for many
of you, someplace

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
that you can go naturally.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, we marry the physical
world and the inner world.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, before your minds
leap to, oh, does that mean

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
more things are going to
happen, well, maybe, maybe not.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We will say there are no
rigid plans in that way.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
There are many possibilities.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to ask you to
remember that should there

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
be physical phenomena,
we also want

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
you to stay connected
to it internally.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And what that means will
be something you discover.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
something we can tell you,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
you do it this way, because
each person's way of doing it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is different, because
each person's story

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
of contact, each person's
experience of contact

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
This is another level
of contact training.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
When you are now stimulated
by external phenomena,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
can you not bring
your energy out?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you acknowledge and
experience the phenomena,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:90%
both internally and externally?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So we've been talking
a lot about the idea

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of taking polarity
and two opposite ideas

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and marrying them to
create a new idea.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about this idea then

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
of internal and
external contact,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
a form of alchemy.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we're
asking you, don't

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
polarize in one direction.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't polarize just
on the excitement.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
We let you do that
last night, all right?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But don't polarize on the
excitement of the external.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Experience it.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Feel its depth.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And then bring it into
you, so that the external

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.735 align:middle line:90%
and the internal can meet.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And this will create a
next level of alchemy

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
for the contact
journey of your planet.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're talking
about your group.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But we're also talking
about the contact journey

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of the many thousands, some
would say tens of thousands,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
of contact groups
around the world.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when one
group makes a leap,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
then you are aiding the
many other contact groups

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
around your world who are
also ready to begin to move

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:90%
into the next phase of alchemy.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Experience the joy.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
push down the joy.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
that childlike wonder.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You can experience the
excitement, the sugar,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.599 align:middle line:90%
but also bring it in.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, Lyssa.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, Reuben.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You seem to be a
reoccurring character here.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.415 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know why.

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, today, we're going
to talk about contact work.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
I've been blessed and honored

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
to experience through
your teachings

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and going to your
contact seminars.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been-- we just
had one this weekend.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And how many was that for me?

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:90%
That was like four or five.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, something like--

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Two in Japan.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Did we do--

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> We did two in Japan.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:90%
And second one here.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So two in the States.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So four.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have a
flavor now of what--

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.098 align:middle line:84%
>> I have not just a
flavor, but I'm so inspired,

00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I actually started my
own contact retreats.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's-- yeah, I've
been learning so much.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And this past weekend as well
has been an amazing experience.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'd like to introduce
to our audience this work.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
What is contact work?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well, I'm going
to start with the old idea,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's really important to
understand how contact work has

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
evolved as we've
evolved as a species.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I started doing this
work, it was in the '80s

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and I was living in Los Angeles.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So my friends and I used
to go out to Joshua Tree.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we would bring
our beach chairs

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and we would just lay there
waiting for them to come.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the '80s
version of contact work.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Before meditation, even?

00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Or would you meditate?

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we would meditate, but
there wasn't an understanding

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of actively
participating or actively

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
reaching out.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And not really an understanding
about the connection

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
between contact work
and consciousness.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, that's the name
of the retreat is "Contact

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and Consciousness," because
you cannot separate the two.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So as the contact work
evolved, in the early '90s,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I started to get a
lot of information

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.163 align:middle line:84%
from one of the
beings I channel,

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:44.955 align:middle line:84%
named Sasha, who you've
had on the program.

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's when she channeled
the information for the book,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:10%
"Preparing for Contact."

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:10%
So that book went
off to the publisher

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and I went off to
Laughlin, at the time,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:10%
to speak at the UFO
Congress that was there.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:90%
So this would have been 1993.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It was autumn of 1993.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
met Dr. Steven Greer.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
When I saw his lecture,
I realized everything

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
he was saying, I
had just written

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in the book that was at
the printers at that time.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that it was
a significant moment

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
in the progression
of our understanding

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
So in those early years,
in the early '90s,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:90%
I trained with Dr. Greer.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
supportive of me.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They knew that I do
channeling, which at that time

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
was not really
something they wanted

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:90%
to include in their protocol.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So at some point,
I went my own way

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
because I really needed to
utilize the skill that I

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:90%
had for the contact work.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in
the '90s, and this

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is when the connection between
contact and consciousness

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:90%
really began to be obvious.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.284 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm learning through all
of this, contact is really--

00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
it's really connected,
not just to us

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
as individuals as a
human contact team,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's also connected
to the mass consciousness

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of our planet.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Our collective
consciousness is also

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
in this process of its own
self-disclosure, if you will.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been this huge
progression from the '90s with

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
lots and lots of different
experimentation in different

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
types of meditation, trying
to work with brainwave states,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
different types of
meditation states, to see--

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
well, back in those
days, we thought

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:90%
there was a magic button.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Like if you push
the magic button,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:90%
then contact will happen.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't realize that it's a
spectrum of experience and that

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
actually we're being
prepared through this shift

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness through time.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So now that it's
been 30 years for me,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
or more than 30 years of
doing this kind of work,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to see that
connection and everything is

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:90%
accelerating.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> After my sighting in
2007, and then working with

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure and The Citizen
Hearing and other things,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to start out as
lights in the sky was the focus.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh, cool, there's
lights in the sky, which

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
must mean there's entities
piloting these things

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But you introduce the
consciousness aspect,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
into everything.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, for me, I
only-- when I started,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:90%
I only believed in ETs.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I did not believe in fairies,
or mermaids, or wood spirits,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I just-- it was just ETs.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
ETs is real and the rest
of it's all whatever.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.438 align:middle line:90%
As you go --

00:10:56.438 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It gets weirder, doesn't it?

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It gets weirder.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And all of a sudden, you
know, mermaids are real,

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.275 align:middle line:84%
fairies are real,
I'm talking to trees.

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:04.075 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:11:04.075 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's fun.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It is very fun.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> So explain that--

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
go into detail
about that process,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where we're at now.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
This past weekend, we had
this strange fog come in

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and it was--

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
there were no lights except
my drone flying around.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But we had contact.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're learning
is that contact is not--

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't adhere to
our definitions of it.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's the number one
foundational thing that we have

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to accept before we can engage
the contact process and allow

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
it to take us where we need
to go in order to make those

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:90%
galactic connections.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about the
connection to consciousness

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
with contact work, as we go
into this process of contact,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to see that
you can't separate the two.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about
consciousness, for some people,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that's a floaty
esoteric thing that

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:90%
is difficult to understand.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The woo.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very much so.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.425 align:middle line:84%
We've joked, but
I'm a skeptic, too.

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So me moving through this
process of opening myself up

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to contact and understanding
it, I also had to fight against

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
my own skepticism, which was,
on one hand, a challenge,

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand,
a really good thing,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:84%
because then you learn more
when you have that healthy

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
skepticism.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, one of the teachings
that Sasha has given now

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
has helped me so much understand
the connection of consciousness

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and contact, because she's
created something she calls

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:90%
a quantum consciousness map.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And you've seen
that in the workshop.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.632 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a big help.

00:13:08.632 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's in the
book, "Golden Lake,"

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:10%
and it's in lots of places on
the YouTube channel and stuff.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.413 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to go
into that in depth here.

00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:10%
However, what it does is it,
in a sense, metaphorically maps

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:10%
out our journey
from being physical,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:10%
separated, mind-driven
beings to what

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:10%
happens as we begin
to open our awareness

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:10%
to more expanded
levels of consciousness

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and inter-dimensionality.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we talked about in
the workshop this weekend,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
we hit that band,
that pain fear band.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is where a lot of
researchers and experiencers

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
have gotten stuck because they
have had a fearful experience

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
or it's brought up their own
pain which they've projected

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
onto the ETs and then they
conclude it's a negative

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
experience and they
stop right there.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But what's really cool is
that the quantum consciousness

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
map is also a metaphor
not just for contact,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but for our own
spiritual development.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So the map works
for both things.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, if we utilize
the map as a way to journey

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:10%
within ourselves
spiritually, we learn

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:10%
to break through that pain and
fear band, healing ourselves,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:10%
and then we're able to go into
the more refined and truer

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:10%
levels of contact that
don't have the mask which is

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.185 align:middle line:10%
a reflection of our own fears.

00:14:52.185 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:10%
Does that make sense?

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well, it makes
them more approachable.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like a
wounded animal that's

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:10%
backed into a cage.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't approach it
because it'll snap at you.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So you wait until it
calms down and until you

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
let it-- or it
surrenders and then you

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:90%
can go in and start petting it.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so many
channeled entities

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:84%
are asked the question, when
are you guys going to land?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Because humans expect
that, well, if they're real,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
then they should be landing at
a football game or something.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But just like you
said, they understand

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.077 align:middle line:84%
our process of evolution and
they don't want to land in--

00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> This guy landed on you.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't want-- they don't--

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the ETs don't want to land
and trigger us, because then--

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --we get wounded.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We go even into the
cage or the closet.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we project our
own pain and fear onto them

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:90%
and then it just spirals.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I've realized, on my
contact experiences,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a memory
of them, but my body

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
has short-circuited.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a memory up
until that moment

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
when it's about to happen
and then I black out.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone that far now
with the work I'm doing.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But realizing that the
nervous system of the body

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
can't handle a lot
of that energy.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that could also be
misinterpreted as an attack

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
or my body's
physically reacting.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, in a negative--
not in a negative way--

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
it's just over--

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like shoving the wrong
plug in the wrong circuit and it

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:90%
blows.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it shuts
down and then--

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.472 align:middle line:90%
>> --and then you're out.

00:16:51.472 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This is another place where
there's been misunderstanding

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
about, for instance,
people saying, well,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:90%
the ETs wiped my memory.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's really easy
for us to blame them.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But the truth is that when
you are experiencing something

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
so intense that is outside the
paradigm of your normal reality

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness, your
mind, your subconscious,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
all of that are going to try
to find a way to process it.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
means shutting down

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
some of the experience until
it can come up at another time,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe in the form
of a screen memory.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an owl.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this brings us to something
you were telling me yesterday

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
about how there's one
part of you that feels

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
really ready for the contact.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you're
faced with it,

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:84%
when you can feel it coming,
that you can see the part

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:90%
of you that isn't yet ready.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That was me on the rock.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
That was-- it was--

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I've said to myself, I'm
ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and here I was by myself in
the middle of Sedona on a rock

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and thinking if it's
going to happen,

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
it's going to happen now because
there's nobody else here.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
really processing, what

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:90%
if it does happen and can it?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to-- and
I was getting scared.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really important
that you saw that in yourself,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and furthermore, that you
didn't project it on to them.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You didn't say, oh,
I feel negative energy.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and--

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was totally me.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's totally you.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the important
steps in this process.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me that you
are using Sasha's map,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that you're traveling
on that map willingly

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and seeing yourself clearly.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's coming.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I know-- well, we
had that taste, too.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's easier with a
group energy, I think,

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
because we're there
to support each other.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We're there to share afterwards
and verify with these things

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to see
shared experiences.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I saw something
right over there.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Moments later-- I think it was
Hamón or Sasha comes through.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And then you channeled
the other being

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and then you said, oh,
they're all around us.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, that's exactly
what I was feeling and saw

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
with other bodies there.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.175 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that time, the cloud
was that UFO-shaped cloud.

00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was like a
spiral coming through.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is very
unusual for Arizona.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of things
that happen simultaneously.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go
and list all of them

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that happened those
two or three nights.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty spectacular.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
The cold temperature, the--

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>> The emergency alert.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The emergency
alert that happened.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, many people
may be familiar with, like,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%
the "Ghost Hunters" show.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just ET, your
typical grey dude in a flying

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:90%
saucer.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the idea what
so many people have about this.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been
watching the show, which

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
you guys are clearly,
then we've broken it down

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:90%
through the channelings.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:90%
But you're actually doing it.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And even now-- it's
been 35 years maybe

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing this
in various different forms.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And there is a part of
me still that's like,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
when am I going
to have-- when are

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:90%
we going to have "the" contact?

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When the contact has
been happening all along.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Never in a way that the
mind or the ego will expect.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But those few
years ago in Japan,

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.185 align:middle line:84%
you were at that retreat
where we got the photograph.

00:20:58.185 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The hybrid 7.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Of hybrid 7.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was a
turning point because somehow,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
we, as humans, often need or--

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
not proof, but we need
that tangible understanding

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:90%
that something was really there.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And when that photograph
happened that was

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
so unexplainable other than
it being an extraterrestrial,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
it was like a part of me could
say, OK, now let's go forward.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
have that anymore.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, for me, it was--

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
my wife, Eureka, she
drew the hybrids.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And especially at that time,
she was not into this at all.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.105 align:middle line:84%
She was like, you
people are crazy.

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not that bad.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.973 align:middle line:84%
>> But she was like,
I'm kind of open to it.

00:21:48.973 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But she thought--
she was freaking out

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
when she got the clear
vision of those beings

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and started drawing them.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
She's like, that's not her
thing to have such clear--

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.315 align:middle line:84%
>> And her drawing
was pretty amazing.

00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Her drawing was amazing.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll put it up here.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:90%
But yeah--

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go into
Japan a little bit.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So how does the
contact work differ

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
being in these two
different cultures?

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say the
number one difference--

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know this having
spent a lot of time in Japan--

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the Japanese
have an easier

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:90%
time creating a unified field.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Because--

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Explain that.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, explain what
is the unified field.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Unified field is a common
ground of consciousness that

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
the group can enter that helps
to create a stable quantum

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:90%
fabric.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You could see it almost
like an air lock,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it's the
combination of two

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:84%
different realities where
there's a bridge where

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:90%
everybody can meet.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So in general, you're
going to find that--

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:90%
or at least I have found--

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that in countries where
there's a lot of individuality,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that it takes a
little bit more work

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
to create that unified
field, unless you're

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:84%
working with a group that
you've worked with many times.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.925 align:middle line:90%
Like our group.

00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Like our group.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The group we've been
working with now.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this
past weekend that it

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
was very easy to go
into that unified field.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So in Japan,
as you well know,

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a saying about the
raised nail gets hammered down.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're not as comfortable
expressing their individuality.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They're more
comfortable expressing

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.720 align:middle line:84%
the collective energy,
which is actually

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:90%
really great for contact work.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:10%
So that's like the
biggest difference

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.277 align:middle line:10%
right away I can say.

00:23:51.277 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And why is it important
for contact work to have that

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:90%
collective energy?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because as we start to
understand the extraterrestrial

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and we
look at it as a spectrum,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:84%
in the books I wrote about
it as a density spectrum.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So forgive me, viewers, if
you don't understand the term.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:90%
But third--

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> They've come along this far.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We've covered it quite a bit.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So third density is where
we've existed for the many last

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years,
which is a heightened sense

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
of separation, where the ego
is like the way we navigate

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
through reality from the
individual perspective.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the spectrum
of consciousness for the ET

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, which
would basically

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
be civilizations that
are older than us,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that they move from that
separated egoic state

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
into still physical but a
state in which the ego is not

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
the main navigator
through reality.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So the ego still serves as
a way to anchor the being

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in a physical reality
or a physical body,

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the one that is
demanding the individuality all

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness then,
as it evolves through these

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
densities-- so now we're
talking about fourth density--

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
what you're finding is
that without that anchor

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of individuality-- and if you
have a group of 30 people,

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
30 anchors trying to express
their individuality--

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
then you instead have a
more homogeneous energy.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting,
because as we evolve

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
through this process, there
are some tripwires that

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:84%
are the things that
are a part of our ego

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:90%
that stop us from evolution.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
what I mean by that

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is that, especially
in the West, we

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
have this fear of the
loss of our individuality.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We're feeling that now.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we get so stuck in this,
I can't lose my individuality

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
or I can't lose my
rights as an individual,

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that we get stuck right there
and we cannot move into this

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:90%
more common ground energy.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So the mistake that
our ego believes

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
is that going through
this evolutionary process

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
on the spectrum means
that we become robots

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:90%
or that we become zombies.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
not what it is at all,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but we won't learn that
until we get there.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So as we do this contact
work with groups--

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that a lot
of the groups that I work with

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:90%
are also my channeling students.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So we do a lot of ego work
in the channeling training.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So they've become
now comfortable

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
with that idea of seeing
that the whole universe is

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
a hologram and each of us
are fractals of the hologram.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's not so much
of that insecurity

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
about letting go of
the individuality

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
see it as a loss,

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
because they can still
be an individual.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, it's also
control issues in a sense, too.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Surrendering.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time with
that for a long time

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.710 align:middle line:84%
until starting this
work and meditating.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the plant
medicines for me really helped

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:90%
was to let that work.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And the funny thing you bring
up about the plant medicine,

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:90%
what I found--

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:84%
when I introduced contact
work to a psychotherapist--

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:84%
it had to have been
like 2001 maybe--

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
he was a recovering addict.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And he always said to me that
contact work was like the best

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.055 align:middle line:84%
drug he's ever taken
without the drug.

00:27:52.055 --> 00:27:52.855 align:middle line:90%
Right

00:27:52.855 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.345 align:middle line:90%
>> that--

00:27:54.345 --> 00:27:55.262 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:27:55.262 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the plant medicine
in a sense is introducing us

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.020 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of the greater
reality of which we are a part,

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we haven't
learned how to enter,

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
but we're being
trained to enter.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what it was like
for me with plant medicines.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It was training wheels.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So it helped.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I think for some people,
for the people who need it,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:84%
they can open the
door and show you

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
things that just on your own you
may be a little too stubborn,

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
a little too much of a
control freak to just let go.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And some of them can be gentle.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Some can really kick you--

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When you need to be
kicked, you get kicked.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And into that other realm.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
this is what this is.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Now I know it exists.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I can get there
and do the work.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.825 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
other modalities

00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
now like breathwork
and things that take

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:90%
me just as far, if not further.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And contact work as well.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Good drug.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Good medicine.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It is addictive.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I hate to use
the word "drug."

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Good medicine.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is a very addictive
activity, actually.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's fun.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very fun.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fun.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we all had so
much fun this weekend.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's one of the reasons.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you were part
of the entertainment.

00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you keep saying that.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.827 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it was going
to be that entertaining.

00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you, viewers, will
see some of the results of his

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
special effect work that he
did during the contact retreat.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll put some
images in there.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, that was bonus.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:90%
That was fun.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And I'm glad you guys
got a kick out of that.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:10%
That was fun.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to Japan
and the contact work.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.795 align:middle line:90%
So creating this unified field--

00:29:38.795 --> 00:29:39.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:39.595 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --breaking down the ego.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So how about the beings?

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Are you interacting
with different beings

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
because you're in Japan
or is it the same energy

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're connecting with?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There's two different
ways to answer that.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, my contact team
follows me wherever I go.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So Sasha, and Hamón, and all
the other beings that are part

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:90%
of it that I don't know.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what continent I'm on.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So the Japanese have become
quite fond of Sasha and Hamón.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And Jermaine.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And Jermaine.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And Jermaine, but not for
the contact work so much.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just because Sasha and
Hamón are like fourth density

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.195 align:middle line:84%
and they're more relatable
as beings or quasi-physical

00:30:32.195 --> 00:30:32.995 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:30:32.995 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But with them, there's a lot
less disbelief I would say.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I think has to do with Shintoism
and their understanding

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:84%
of nature spirits and the
gods and goddesses of Japan,

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
who I tend to think a lot
of them in the ancient days

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Sasha has done a lot of
channeling about that in Japan.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So on that level then, in
Japan, there's less resistance.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They even don't resist the idea
of ghosts and things like that.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's less to break
through, let's say,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:90%
in the East--

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> In the belief systems.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.212 align:middle line:90%
>> --than there is in the West.

00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing that
also I've noticed,

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:84%
being in both locations,
is how intricate

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
the physical land and the
spirits of the physical land

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and the teachings of
the physical land--

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
this weekend we
connected into some

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American energies,
the four peaks was brought up.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we connected to
future Fountain Hills,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a hybridized civilization,
that was also, again,

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
connected to the land.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:90%
So the land was a key--

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a key
part in Japan as well.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing through
Hamón and Sasha to talk about

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:90%
the nine schools of--

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the school of
the nine serpents.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.368 align:middle line:84%
>> The school of
the nine serpents,

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:84%
which was heavily influenced
in Kyoto and the energy there.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:90%
So you want to add to that?

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really interesting
for me is the Syrian energy,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:90%
which would be Hamón's energy.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And in season 2,
maybe you saw this.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It was quite appropriate Hamón
was channeling in Sedona with

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:84%
the horses and the
donkey, Charlie.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Charlie.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I found is that even
though we think of the Syrians

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
as extraterrestrials, as I've
come to learn who they are,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
they're very much
connected to the land.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the ancient days,
in Japan, for example,

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Hamón has talked about the times
when the ancient Syrians were

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:84%
there, mentoring
the early humans.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was always very much
of a connection with the land.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Even Hamón-- they joke
in Japan about it--

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
but whenever Lyssa is
channeling outside,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Hamón comes much more than
if I'm in a classroom.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This happened at the
contact retreat this weekend.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind
of a paradox there.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> That the more we merge
with our galactic heritage,

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.000 align:middle line:84%
the more we actually
connect with our planet,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:84%
with our physicality, with the
consciousness of our Earth.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Which is like a giant
portal in itself

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:84%
with all of these elements
to different civilizations,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to the different trees
and insects and birds,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and all of everything here.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
some sort of doorway

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to another reality,
another dimension.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And the civilization that
contacted us this weekend

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
at the retreat,
as you mentioned,

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
they're from about 500
years in the future,

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
a civilization that lives
in this area of Arizona,

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:90%
the Fountain Hills area.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I'm
busy with the group

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and I don't let myself really
go into the contact experience.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning that
it's OK for me to do that.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
That I'm not abandoning
the group when I do it.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So this time I let
myself do that and was

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:90%
able to see those beings.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They were a hybrid beings living
here 500 years in the future.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And what they showed me was what
it looked like here 500 years.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was like being
in a pueblo almost.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.427 align:middle line:90%
So it was back to the land--

00:34:44.427 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Back to the land.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> --again.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And we also hear that from many
of the beings I've spoken to

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and I asked them about what's
life like on their planet,

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot of them--

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
all of them so far
have said, well,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we try to let nature do its
thing as much as possible.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We live in small
groups, not big cities,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're very
connected to whatever

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:90%
the home planet's nature is.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to be, as we
advance in our consciousness,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
to me we're headed back there.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It makes so
much sense, though,

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
because in a third
density reality,

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:84%
our experience is to be the
most separated from everything.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So concrete cities and
Wi-Fi and all of that

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is the most separated
we can become.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But as we move more
into fourth density

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and more into that
integrated energy,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:47.162 align:middle line:84%
we go back into reconnecting
with the reality around us,

00:35:47.162 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
would include the land.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Which, there are Indigenous
cultures around the world

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:90%
we're so connected to.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And it seems they--

00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:10%
I just had dinner with Clifford
Mahooty from the Zuni tribe.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking about--

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:10%
still to this day, the stories
that were passed down--

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:10%
but how connected
to spirit they are

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:10%
and how he does his prayers
daily and acknowledges

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:10%
all the nature spirits.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's that tie that they
still hold today in tradition.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Ron does a lot of that, too.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he does.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to
connect with that tomorrow.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just saying that they
kind of are already doing it.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We just somehow-- we
called it woo woo.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we're
going back to it.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just so ironic that when
we imagine these civilizations

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:84%
from the future
or from out there,

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.860 align:middle line:84%
that we think of
these sci-fi movies.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it might end up
being that they are more

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:90%
grounded than we realize.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.198 align:middle line:84%
So the future is actually
not "Star Trek," but more

00:37:03.198 --> 00:37:04.240 align:middle line:90%
like "Lord of the Rings."

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The elves, of course,
being fairy Pleiadian.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel it's a
Pleiadian memory.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't think
Syrians are elves, too?

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, in there,
yes, definitely.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more we do this
and the more conversations

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and the more I'm
interacting, in season one,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
you'll see I talk
about "Star Trek."

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big "Star Trek" fan.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But now it's all about
dark crystal and "Lord

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:33.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Rings."

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait, that's the future.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, it's crazy
how this is evolving.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:90%
We're near , 1997.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.760 align:middle line:90%
We had a big sighting.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems to be-- this was
something we were talking about

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
this morning with Michelle and
Tate is about there's different

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:84%
interpretations of
that to this day,

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:84%
even though the evidence says
and the witnesses says it's not

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:90%
from this world.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Even Fife Symington, the
governor at the time,

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.710 align:middle line:84%
came out on "60
Minutes" and said,

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:90%
it was not from this world.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:84%
There's still is this
just dispute over-- oh,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
it was just flares,
it was this or that.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I have a theory that it
was because of the law

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of noninterference, there's
still mechanisms and ways

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that they can still do
these mass sightings

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:90%
and still be elusive.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And everybody's wondering
and ask me all the time, well,

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:84%
why don't they just land
on the White House lawn?

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think, if they did, still
people would be in denial.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.652 align:middle line:84%
Well, didn't they fly over
the White House in the '50s?

00:38:47.652 --> 00:38:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '50s, I think there's
video of that or a video--

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.440 align:middle line:90%
or film, actually--

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:90%
35-millimeter film.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So what do you have
to say about that?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The disclosure issue is a
really challenging one right

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.750 align:middle line:84%
now because it's in a sense the
exact opposite of what contact

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Because disclosure is
waiting for someone

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
else, outside of you,
to validate the contact

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And that means nothing.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because in this day and age,
with YouTube and Photoshop--

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Deepfake.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything can be created.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we had the most definitive
piece of film evidence,

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't matter at all.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It won't change
consciousness.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've come to the
understanding disclosure is

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:57.480 align:middle line:84%
about self-disclosure, meaning
that each of us needs to do

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.250 align:middle line:84%
the work within ourselves
if we're excited about it,

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to disclose the reality
of this to ourselves.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is the only
thing that is going

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to change the consciousness.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we do these types of
contact retreats and contact

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
work in the desert or wherever,
that the repeated experiences

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.030 align:middle line:84%
of doing it provide a
way for us to disclose

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:90%
to our self this reality.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And I always remember
the movie "Contact"

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:90%
with Jodie Foster.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It was such an amazing movie
that came out in the '90s,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.210 align:middle line:90%
well ahead of its time.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to see it, I
remember with Sherry Adamak,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:84%
who was Steven Greer's
right-hand person here

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.690 align:middle line:90%
in Phoenix, actually.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:49.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:49.975 --> 00:40:50.775 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:50.775 --> 00:40:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And in the movie--

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.295 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
remember it totally.

00:40:55.295 --> 00:40:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry about that.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But there was an argument
between a scientist

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and Jodie Foster talking
about the reality of it.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't prove it.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the question was,
well, do you love your father?

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:90%
And the answer was yes.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.357 align:middle line:90%
Prove it.

00:41:17.357 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's right.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.990 align:middle line:90%
She did say that.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You cannot prove
your experience,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:84%
but your experience will
be the disclosure you need

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.680 align:middle line:90%
for your own truth.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
contact work does.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we all expose
ourselves to this,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that's what will generate the
disclosure, not from out there.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But it will become such
a truth of our reality

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even need the fake
stories that we're being told.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.088 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I was
saying this morning.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's a way--

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:84%
in a way, we've chosen I think
a different timeline since '97,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:84%
because in one way, before the
internet, before all of this,

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
in 1997, if the news
in the mass media

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:13.030 align:middle line:84%
did validate the
experience of, let's say,

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the UFO over as a UFO,
I think-- at that time,

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.155 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people would
actually buy into it, way more

00:42:23.155 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:90%
than what would happen now.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So I feel at that time,
because we didn't choose that,

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:84%
it was wishy-washy and military
launching flares and these

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:84%
kinds of things, that it
actually gave us the new

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
timeline that we're in now
where we can go and do this.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And things have
become so wishy-washy

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.477 align:middle line:84%
now, that we have to keep
going and keep going until we

00:42:50.477 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:90%
validate it for ourselves.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the only way we're
going to get the truth.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.583 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the only way we're
going to get the truth.

00:42:55.583 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But by choice in a sense,
collectively, so we

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.390 align:middle line:84%
can go to perhaps help other
civilizations in the future

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:84%
or understand more
about ourselves

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and self-empowering ourselves.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting you bring
up the lights because we had

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
an interesting
experience with that.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.820 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I
mentioned Sherry Adamak--

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the late Sherry Adamak-- who
was a very close friend of mine.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.460 align:middle line:84%
She was staying
with us that night.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And the night of the lights,
we kind of got this message

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
from the universe to
put chairs on our roof

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
to do contact work on our roof.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This is not anything
we've ever done.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But we got the instructions
to do it that night.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So my husband Ron put
the chairs up there.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But we ended up talking and
having so much fun and eating

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:84%
dinner that we got lazy
and didn't go up there.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And it flew over
our neighborhood.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Because later we met people
who live within a few miles

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of us, a family with children
who are all reporting what they

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:06.670 align:middle line:90%
saw.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a triangular ship.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So there were a lot of
things going on that night.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So you got the message,
but you didn't see it.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we got the
message, but didn't do it.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So you got to do
more inner work.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.025 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not about up there.

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, I know.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's amazing.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.360 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to--

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:84%
what are some tips
for people at home

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:35.020 align:middle line:84%
if they aren't able to
make it to your retreat

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and do this type of work.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
What are some ways to put
them in the right direction?

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.977 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, you don't have
to come to my retreat.

00:44:43.977 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the only one doing this.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.685 align:middle line:84%
You can come to
Reuben's retreat.

00:44:46.685 --> 00:44:47.625 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
the sales pitch.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And many other retreats.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of online
work going on now, too.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important,
I feel, to find a group.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be a large group.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It can just be a group of
three friends if you want.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But a group of people
that you resonate with,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
who are with you in the same
place with your understanding

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:90%
of the experience.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And you just experiment
and you trust

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.600 align:middle line:84%
the intuition that you
have or the inspiration

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.870 align:middle line:84%
you get about, hey,
let's go in the backyard

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and do this specific meditation.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Also, of course,
CSETI organization

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.550 align:middle line:10%
has their own tools
that can be downloaded.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Like an app.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:10%
They have an app.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:45.540 align:middle line:10%
So there's many ways to learn
the beginner aspects of it.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
if you go into it

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:84%
with a pure heart, genuine
enthusiasm, genuine excitement,

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and the willingness
to watch yourself

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and your reactions,
that's the key.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as we talked
about at the beginning,

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.990 align:middle line:84%
if you get caught in the
projections of your own fear,

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:84%
you will never break through
that pain and fear band

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to move to the level
of the contact work.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely something
that everyone can do.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.833 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
have to be outside.

00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in
your living room.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do it in your bed.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:25.680 align:middle line:90%
You can do it anywhere.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just the outside part of
it adds the potential lights

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Fun light show
that we can get--

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.605 align:middle line:84%
>> But lately we've
been getting fogs.

00:46:39.605 --> 00:46:40.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> This is another thing.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking
about the importance

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of the inner experience,
but we have to, of course,

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge the outer
experience is fun, too.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's super fun to
get the weird quantum fog,

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to get people's emergency
alerts going off on their phone,

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.030 align:middle line:90%
to get--

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:03.230 align:middle line:84%
we had three people who somehow
went into an Arctic zone.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.570 align:middle line:84%
While the rest of the people
were sitting in 80 degrees,

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.070 align:middle line:90%
they were below 0 or below 32.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So that phenomena is fun and
it also gets your attention.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's marry the two.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.120 align:middle line:84%
The inner experience
and the outer experience

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:90%
often get reflected.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a big takeaway

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.781 align:middle line:84%
from all this contact work is
that inner journey in the--

00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:35.810 align:middle line:84%
as you said, the dichotomy,
the polarity that we can--

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the mirroring effect that
we can look at ourselves--

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --through this.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's my biggest
takeaway from doing this work.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding out in this
journey of self-discovery--

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'm sorry Sasha is like
telling me what to say and--

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --or what to--

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was
just going to say,

00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:02.420 align:middle line:84%
let's bring in Sasha for
some final closing remarks.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Because she's like
shouting in my ear over here.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So, yeah, that's perfect.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, my dear.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It's Sasha here.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Sasha.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You know we have
a message for you.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:90%
We could feel it.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's also an important
message for the viewers.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:36.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
frequently asked questions

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is who is contacting
us, who are these ETs?

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And from the point of view
of a third density human,

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:84%
any ET that would come
is considered an "other."

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> However, if you look at
the nature of consciousness,

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.610 align:middle line:90%
which is a hologram--

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:84%
all consciousness is one
hologram and the individuals

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:13.120 align:middle line:84%
are expressed as fractals
of that hologram--

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:84%
then, if you
extrapolate that idea

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to the question who
is contacting us,

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:90%
the question answers itself.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the answer is
other versions of you,

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:36.280 align:middle line:84%
other fractals of you are the
ones who are contacting you.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So then the question
may continue

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:84%
to be asked in the
form of, are there

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.850 align:middle line:84%
any beings that contact me that
are not other versions of me?

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.580 align:middle line:84%
You see, this question can
drive you crazy a little bit.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In the broad
metaphysical sense, no,

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:84%
there really isn't anything that
isn't you that could contact

00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:59.770 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> However, very often, if there
are unhealed aspects within

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:16.870 align:middle line:84%
a person, the contacts that
come may trigger those unhealed

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.910 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, it's an
opportunity for the contactee

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to either engage with
the being in such a way

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.920 align:middle line:84%
as to facilitate
their own healing

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or to reject the contact,
see it as something separate

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:40.150 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps something invasive.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at a
holographic expression

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.660 align:middle line:84%
of the farthest separation
moving into integration.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.620 align:middle line:84%
That is ultimately what
the contact experience

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.890 align:middle line:84%
is facilitating and you are
smack in the middle of it.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had this vision as
you're talking about it.

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of work with
plant medicines and meditations

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
where we go back to
the version of our self

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.840 align:middle line:90%
that has been traumatized--

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --at a young age and we tell
ourselves a different story

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.110 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Is that what's happening
with these future versions

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves telling
us a different story?

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.080 align:middle line:84%
If you remember at
the retreat, one

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of the lectures we talked
about had to do with--

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
species, the original

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.680 align:middle line:90%
wound of when the ETs left you.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's a deep
abandonment wound.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The abandonment
wound can actually

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:84%
be extended all the way
back to original separation,

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:06.070 align:middle line:84%
the original movement
into separation

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.430 align:middle line:84%
from the expression of
the one or the hologram.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was original pain.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Original pain manifests
itself in different ways.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So it can manifest itself as a
parent leaving a child or an ET

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:28.640 align:middle line:84%
leaving a young species
to fend for itself.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are deep
archetypal wounds.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So the contact experience
arises in a civilization

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:84%
as a civilization is
getting ready to make

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.090 align:middle line:84%
its shift into a more integrated
state of consciousness.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the contact
experience, you can say,

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:54.910 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly timed to the
evolution of a species.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But it does bring
up all the stuff

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.610 align:middle line:90%
for the purpose of healing.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of two ways-- we
have to process these traumas

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:10.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to receive the
contact, but the contact is also

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.310 align:middle line:90%
triggering these traumas.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.655 align:middle line:84%
The chicken or
the egg situation.

00:53:15.655 --> 00:53:16.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:53:16.455 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, when you're
working in this deep quantum

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
level of healing, there is no
chicken and egg coming first.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So it actually doesn't
matter where you start.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Your starting point
doesn't really matter.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:40.690 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that
when something comes up

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:84%
with the issue,
can you engage it?

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And when we say
engage it, we're not

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about intellectually
dissecting it to death.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about noticing
that the fear is coming up

00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:84%
in that contact
experience, or maybe

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:02.200 align:middle line:84%
an anger, or some pain, or
maybe even a past life memory,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.850 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And can you sit with
it and actually feel

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.300 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is you're feeling
and allow that feeling

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to, in a sense, unravel
the bundle that you've

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.540 align:middle line:84%
created in yourself that was the
story you told yourself, which

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.140 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what you just said.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess the exciting
thing is what's

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:84%
happening in our world,
economy, and political arenas,

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and just everything with
the virus and everything,

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:48.220 align:middle line:84%
if we can use this lesson
from our dear Sasha here,

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.430 align:middle line:84%
then it must mean we're getting
very close because things

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.230 align:middle line:84%
are getting really
amped up worldwide.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you are closer
than you realize.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.832 align:middle line:84%
However, many people
have thought the shift

00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:01.040 align:middle line:90%
is going to be like a button.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more of a
spectrum of experience.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> However, you are getting to
that critical mass point where

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:84%
all of the repressed energy that
you have held within yourself,

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:20.110 align:middle line:84%
as a species, when you have
not been willing to look within

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand the projections
you see in the world,

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:28.220 align:middle line:84%
then a critical mass is created
that you have to move through.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So your year, 2020, has been
one of those nexus points

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:38.590 align:middle line:84%
for your civilization to
give it an opportunity

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at the
mirror of themselves

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.500 align:middle line:84%
instead of continuing the
game of the projection.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of
projections and contact,

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:54.340 align:middle line:84%
there's many people in the let's
say the new age communities

00:55:54.340 --> 00:56:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and coming into this information
who are talking about this idea

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of a big flash and then
everything's going to be

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:04.690 align:middle line:90%
wonderful and great.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be a big flash day.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And after that, all the bad
guys are going to go away

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and all of the good guys are
going to be left in the planet.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to live
happily ever after.

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.790 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on--

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:16.632 align:middle line:90%
>> --what we can look at?

00:56:16.632 --> 00:56:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The lesson is that waiting
for something to come from

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:30.380 align:middle line:90%
outside will be a futile cause.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.915 align:middle line:84%
All right, we'll say
that quite honestly.

00:56:32.915 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Resistance is futile.

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Resistance is futile.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we go to the
foundational truth

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone is
feeling something.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So the story that you create
to explain what you're feeling

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:56.740 align:middle line:84%
will be a product of the habits
and patterns that you have

00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and the stories that you have
created for yourself over time.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So this idea then of a big flash
and everything will be nice,

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.710 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, is the old
paradigm that the power

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.270 align:middle line:90%
is outside of you.

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
anything happening out there

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and everything to
do with the alchemy

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.760 align:middle line:90%
within your consciousness.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So you said an
important thing here

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.510 align:middle line:84%
about the bad guys will
go away and then everybody

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.310 align:middle line:90%
will be good.

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:35.645 align:middle line:84%
>> That is further enhancing
and validating a polarized

00:57:35.645 --> 00:57:36.445 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:57:36.445 --> 00:57:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That cannot happen.

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.520 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons why,
as Hamón spoke to you about

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:84%
previously, the shadow work
is coming up very strongly

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.280 align:middle line:84%
for people now because it
is creating that alchemy

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of the dark and the light
within each individual that has

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to come together.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So the big flash, we
would say is the alchemy.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.800 align:middle line:90%
So they're sensing--

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --they're sensing the alchemy
but misunderstanding that it

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.130 align:middle line:84%
means one side will go away
and the other will prevail.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.590 align:middle line:84%
In reality, the flash is the
alchemy or the integration.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The integration.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're getting very,
very, very close to that.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.350 align:middle line:84%
But as we've said, it's not
a moment, it's a process.

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.765 align:middle line:90%
You said it's all within.

00:58:25.765 --> 00:58:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Recently I've been
doing all this filming

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've been, in
a sense, neglecting

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.500 align:middle line:84%
my internal practice
of breathwork

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and my usual routine.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But what I've noticed is
through viewing other people

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and seeing them
do their process,

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I am actually getting a sense
of satisfaction, a confirmation

00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and understanding through
everybody else doing their work

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:05.305 align:middle line:90%
and me just observing it.

00:59:05.305 --> 00:59:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I don't
need to meditate today,

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:11.260 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just observing
all of this transformation

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanisms and
seeing all this stuff.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:15.147 align:middle line:90%
Am I making any sense?

00:59:15.147 --> 00:59:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you are
making entire sense,

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.940 align:middle line:84%
because the philosophy on your
world that you've called yogic

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.290 align:middle line:90%
wisdom--

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is in
the sacred texts--

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:28.000 align:middle line:90%
has two very basic ideas--

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.850 align:middle line:84%
stilling the mind
and seeing clearly.

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So your practice that you
have done all these years

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:38.680 align:middle line:84%
has been your ability
to still the mind.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.930 align:middle line:84%
When you are able to
have that ability,

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and then begin to cultivate
clear seeing or the ability

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to see yourself clearly, your
relationship to your practices

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:52.120 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And therefore you don't need
it as religiously as you did

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.030 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually feel
the energy of the practice

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:05.300 align:middle line:84%
by observing others doing
their practice as well.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.100 align:middle line:90%
So it makes perfect sense to us.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not falling
off the saddle.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, do we feel
some guilt here?

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I got
to do more meditation.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I got to do my thing.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> For many of you who
do a lot of service,

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and this show and all the crazy
filming schedule that you had

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and all of that is your way
of expressing your service.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when you
express your service,

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
you go out of
balance a little bit.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You, everyone else.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing is that
when the service is finished,

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.170 align:middle line:90%
do you find the compass again?

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you can,
all is well, my dear.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I think this contact work is
super exciting and looking

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
forward to going on
some more adventures

01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
with Lyssa, Sasha, and the team.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:07.995 align:middle line:84%
>> This is how right now the
contact experience needs to be.

01:01:07.995 --> 01:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
You already know the reasons
for why we cannot land

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:13.720 align:middle line:90%
in the baseball field.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And even though maybe others
would argue with us about that,

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
but it's not an issue for us.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
We've had contact with many,
many hundreds of species

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
before yours and we
know the process.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So then, the process must
become the preparation

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness for the
contact experience itself.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And as we've said
previously, and as Lyssa

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.330 align:middle line:10%
has said, what
that means is then

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:47.410 align:middle line:10%
you have to understand the
contact landscape, which means

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:52.210 align:middle line:10%
the quantum map that we have
presented for you shows you

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the different, let's
say, landmarks on the map

01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:01.030 align:middle line:10%
that you will need to
experience on your way

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:05.980 align:middle line:10%
to contact in the
truest sense, which

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.970 align:middle line:10%
is contacting other
aspects of you

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:12.040 align:middle line:10%
and recognizing
yourself as a hologram.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:17.710 align:middle line:10%
However, again,
as Lyssa has said,

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.760 align:middle line:10%
your civilization right now
is hitting the pain and fear

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.050 align:middle line:10%
band in this process.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Most civilizations do that.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And civilizations will
create different ways

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
to manifest that.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Right now in your world you're
creating the virus as a trigger

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to move you through
this pain and fear band,

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to give you the opportunity to
choose projection on others,

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
continued separation of
bad guys and good guys,

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
or understanding
that, in a sense,

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
the pain and fear band
is lined with mirrors,

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
giving you the opportunity
to see yourself.

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite obvious
this whole idea of lockdown

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
was giving humanity the
opportunity to look at itself.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Some of you heeded the call.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Some of you did not.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
However, a lot of
you did and it has

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:19.670 align:middle line:90%
started to change the energy.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You might not see it
yet, but you will see it.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I can feel it.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah, seeing it will--

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
remnant pieces of
evidence where things

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.170 align:middle line:90%
are moving along quite nicely.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You know my civilization
created a plague as well.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was mentioned--

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.353 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've mentioned
it here on the show,

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
but in your work--

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in Lyssa's past work
it's been mentioned.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I ask how long
did that plague last?

01:03:50.795 --> 01:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how long it lasts
is always dependent upon how

01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
resistant the
species is to change.

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
In my civilization, it
lasted quite a long time

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
because the pattern
of my civilization

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient days was to
only look at the positive

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and to shove the
negative under the rug.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when a plague
such as that comes up,

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very
difficult to ignore.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.020 align:middle line:90%
However, it took us a long time.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
We would say, in your
way of counting, it was--

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
we're sorry to say, my
dear, about 40 years.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's-- it's
better than 400.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:36.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, that's true.

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>> But OK.

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%
But--

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> 40 years.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:41.495 align:middle line:90%
>> --in human lifespan--

01:04:41.495 --> 01:04:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> In human lifespan.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> --that's a big chunk of life.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It took that long--

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and we do have to
say, in fairness,

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that the plague unfolded
in an elongated way

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
compared to yours, which
was very, very fast.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.290 align:middle line:90%
But it took a while.

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
When you exhaust
all of your options

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and you reach that
place of desperation,

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
it's when you get to
that place of desperation

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%
that you open the most.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you open,
you can then see roads

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that you would not have
considered previously.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So for you, the
road you're going

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to take on Earth right
now with this virus

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and the subsequent things
that it's triggered

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
is really not defined,
because, actually,

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
as we see your time stream,
you are flipping timelines

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
very fast.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that is causing

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
those of you who are sensitive
to be a little bit disoriented.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So you haven't settled
on a timeline yet.

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, which makes sense.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm positive we
will get through this.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yes.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.457 align:middle line:84%
>> At least my
version of reality.

01:05:56.457 --> 01:05:58.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:05:58.070 --> 01:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you will
get through it.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what's
on the other side.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, exactly.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's already--

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
many in my circles

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
have had a lot of
positivity coming from this,

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
which I know many, many
watching may not feel that,

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
but there's two sides of the
coin for what's happening.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We have said, this is one of
Earth's biggest opportunities

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
for transformation that you've
received in a very long time.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So take it and don't
be afraid to go in deep

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
into the areas of polarity
that you've not wished to go

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in, because when you do,
you won't need to project it

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.580 align:middle line:90%
outward anymore.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we can have you guys
land on the White House alone.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe not the
White House lawn.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at least in
our contact retreats.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.460 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Or someplace fun like
maybe Grand Canyon

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.370 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
As always, what a huge honor
to receive this information

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and share it with the world
in this form and fashion.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And always, we thank you as
well for the service you are

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
providing, to the viewers, for
helping them to know they are

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
not alone in the thoughts and
feelings and experiences that

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:22.880 align:middle line:90%
they have.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
There are many others on
the planet having them too.

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the service
you're providing

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is helping to link
those people together.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Much love to you and
much love to you, viewers,

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.460 align:middle line:90%
out there as well.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:37.434 --> 01:07:48.993 align:middle line:90%


01:07:48.993 --> 01:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, there was
a lot to say there.

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:54.855 align:middle line:84%
I was-- we talked much more
than I thought we were.

01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
But it was all very--

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.022 align:middle line:90%
>> She was just la, la, la, la.

01:07:57.022 --> 01:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very, very
good information.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much needed.

01:08:00.778 --> 01:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I see the through line
and the connections.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, thank you, again, for
just being the clear channel

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
you are, for making this
information available,

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and inviting myself and our
team-- our team back here,

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
say hi.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:19.544 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you can get
on there somewhere.

01:08:19.544 --> 01:08:20.344 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lyssa.

01:08:20.344 --> 01:08:20.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:21.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Hugs?

01:08:21.579 --> 01:08:22.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a wrap.

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a wrap on this one.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.279 align:middle line:90%
>> On this one.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Much more to come.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay!

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo-hoo!

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay!

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What I find with Lyssa's work
is that it's ET contact meets

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and expansion
of consciousness.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I love what I see with the
progression of these retreats

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
is that the evolution of where
we're headed as a species,

01:08:52.510 --> 01:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
as humans, it's so nice to get
information not only on what

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
an ET perspective is
on what's going on,

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
but absolute confirmation
of what I'm seeing happening

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.069 align:middle line:90%
in my alignment with my work.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:10.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Very relatable style.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
She's so down to Earth.

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:13.850 align:middle line:90%
She's so easy to relate to.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.937 align:middle line:84%
She's the opposite
of woo-woo, which

01:09:15.937 --> 01:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is not what you expect when you
think about someone channeling

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
aliens.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> She brings through
several channels,

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.359 align:middle line:84%
which is really great for
helping us understand what it

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
is we're doing and guide
us through this process.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That group energy and
everybody supporting each

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.260 align:middle line:90%
other.

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like people that

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
first traverse the jungles.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.229 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're part of the
forward motion of change.

01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Pioneers.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Pioneers.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.229 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm humble.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm just humble.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
This contact work is
life-transforming.

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:57.230 align:middle line:10%
It's a way to clean out
yourself in certain respects

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:58.600 align:middle line:10%
and become a better person.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And you take that to
the everyday world,

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.300 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Who would have
thought contact work

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
would bring you
out and just bring

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:08.410 align:middle line:90%
the best of who you can be.

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something magical
right now that's happening.

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And to have somebody
who can lead us

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
through this at a
really profound time,

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to have very
positive experiences,

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
to be reminded that there's
love, to be reminded we're

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
not alone.

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody comes
together, works together,

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.880 align:middle line:90%
shares their gift.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I always leave lighter,
brighter, a clearer direction.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I always feel like
I get a roadmap.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It's such a great
combination of doing inner work,

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.190 align:middle line:10%
which is probably the most
important thing in all of this.

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:46.420 align:middle line:10%
But also having little bits
of validation from the outside

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.970 align:middle line:10%
and also connecting to
all the other people.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is on
the same wavelength,

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a really high
frequency wavelength, which

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.770 align:middle line:90%
what makes it so wonderful.

01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The cohesion that everybody
brings every year seems

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:00.620 align:middle line:90%
to escalate.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So the first year
was at this level.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.820 align:middle line:90%
The next year it's there.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.950 align:middle line:10%
This year was off the charts.

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's information that I can
take and proceed in my life

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and continue on my awakening
path in a beautiful

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and profound way.

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And immediately we had
all these phenomena happen.

01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So there are all these
sparks in the sky.

01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%
That was really cool.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But even more
impressive than that

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
were these orange
orbs that appeared.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And it happened I
think five times.

01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a one-time thing.

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And nobody had expectations,
which makes it-- maybe

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.930 align:middle line:90%
even that's why it happened.

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And you would see one orange orb
and dimming out and brightening

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and another showing up.

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.760 align:middle line:10%
And I think the coolest
exciting that we had was

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.350 align:middle line:10%
that Lyssa took a video.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:54.482 align:middle line:10%
And later in the dining room,
she was looking at the video

01:11:54.482 --> 01:11:55.940 align:middle line:10%
and she's like,
oh, it's all black.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.680 align:middle line:10%
And she almost deleted it.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.440 align:middle line:10%
And what she didn't
realize and eventually we

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.645 align:middle line:10%
saw that in the
middle of the video--

01:12:02.645 --> 01:12:04.190 align:middle line:10%
the all black video--

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.440 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden, at the
corner of the video,

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.180 align:middle line:10%
a triangle appeared.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was a craft.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the
three lights and some bars.

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's becoming
more and more visceral,

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
more and more
physical, more real.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So less like trying to think
it's just in your imagination.

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually physical
manifestations and experiences

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that make it seem much
more solid and physical.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> But when we do contact
work in a group energy,

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
we can get into those altered
states where we become more

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
sensitive of other
dimensions of ourselves.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Just amazing.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.780 align:middle line:10%
We did have visceral
experiences,

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.710 align:middle line:10%
which is what a lot of people
obviously want-- validation.

01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:58.220 align:middle line:10%
But the internal messages
that Hamón and Sasha brought

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:03.120 align:middle line:10%
in and how it affected
everybody here is just amazing.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a chance for us to
know the other part of our self

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
better, so that we can integrate
them and eventually merge back

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.210 align:middle line:90%
to the source.

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.950 align:middle line:90%
So that we're not separated.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So that we are more expanded.

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So that our consciousness
is more expanded and wider.

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So that our ego has
less effect on us.

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So that we're not
driven by our ego,

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
but by a universal
consciousness.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a perception
of extraterrestrials being

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
advanced or more spiritual, but
in reality we're really equal

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to each other and that's the
most important thing that we

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have to have that mindset,
that understanding,

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to have the
ability to meet them eventually

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
face to face.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> More important in the
inside than the outside.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the outside, maybe
you see a craft but you cannot

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:05.530 align:middle line:90%
communicate with it.

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So you still don't understand
a message from them.

01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you connect inside,
even if you don't see a craft,

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
you may be getting a download,
you may be getting a message,

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.568 align:middle line:84%
and you can
understand the message

01:14:19.568 --> 01:14:20.610 align:middle line:90%
they are trying to bring.

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you to
lift up your consciousness

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:28.120 align:middle line:84%
one step closer to them
so that you can meet them.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it
shifts your consciousness.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we make closer contact
with our interstellar brethren,

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that capacity for love
opens up exponentially.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that the human
capacity for love is infinite.

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And experiencing more
and more of that,

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
just levels of connection,
levels of love,

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
levels of perception of
the interdimensional nature

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.470 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And just because other beings
may not be visible to us,

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make
them any less real.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And the communication
that we have with them

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
through these kind of events
helps build a solid foundation

01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
for the awareness that
we can live and love

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:20.190 align:middle line:90%
every moment of our existence.

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just like, OK
seeing a crowd, seeing lights,

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
but we actually get interaction.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And we are able to speak
their language in a way

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:30.750 align:middle line:90%
through light language.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
That to me is just amazing.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:35.120 align:middle line:90%
