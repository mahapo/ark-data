00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Georgia, welcome.

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:01.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Reuben.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I should say welcome
to me, here in Hawaii.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to beautiful Hawaii.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> This is awesome.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, what a great
place to do an interview.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Well manifested.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Well manifested.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.673 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
[VOCALIZING] So we're going
to do some channeling later.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But before, I want to get to
know you a little bit more.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And your work, and
your play, and how you--

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:90%
how this all came about.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So first off, who are you?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And why are we in Hawaii?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that is
a good question.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, my name is Georgia Jean.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a channel for
the Circle of Light.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a
broad-spectrum energist.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Broad-spectrum energist.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Explain that, please.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Just meaning my energy skills
run across a broad spectrum

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:90%
of abilities.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.725 align:middle line:90%
>> So I've got healing hands.

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:54.525 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.787 align:middle line:84%
Like Reiki or Qigong,
kind of thing?

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never trained
in Reiki, but I just--

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
once I had my event, you know,
it was just coming through.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm not really--

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
that convinced me

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that I, after having
this event, that I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.027 align:middle line:90%
had these new-found abilities.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go right
into the event then.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go right
into the event.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we can build
back from there.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Build back.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is the event?

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Australian.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.613 align:middle line:90%
I was living in New York--

00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:21.413 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Los Angeles.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Being a stand-up comedian.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:10%
>> And I was performing at
the Comedy Store on Sunset.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a very harsh, hard world.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was doing a lot of
personal development work,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.172 align:middle line:84%
just to kind of cope with the
mayhem of the Hollywood scene.

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I mean,
you've been in Hollywood.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of rejection.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You're just, like, kind of like
dealing with a lot of stuff.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I was being harassed, you know?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.715 align:middle line:10%
It was a me too
kind of experience.

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.867 align:middle line:84%
>> And I really didn't want
to quit performing there

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
because it was my one
big break in Hollywood.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, of
the top three clubs,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.553 align:middle line:84%
and I worked really
hard to be there.

00:03:58.553 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.937 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was kind of like
this campaign of harassment.

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately in that world,
they take advantage of people

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:90%
who want to be in--

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the
Hollywood industry.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I know--

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfortunately.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And these guys, it was really
just they didn't want me there.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
It was other comics.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- they
didn't want competition.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, look,
I just ended up

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
having to leave because
I had a couple of really

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
bad experiences there.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
heartbreaking because I--

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
my good self was like, I
want to stand up for women.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.852 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to not get
run out of this scene.

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I want to do the right thing.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.755 align:middle line:84%
I want to be strong
enough, within myself.

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:35.555 align:middle line:10%
>> Mhm.

00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>> And the big lesson I
learned about the good ego,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:10%
how that can also keep you
in-- in the limitation.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So I finally, after
it just got so terrible--

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.618 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, that was
part of my soul going,

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
can you get out of here so
this other thing can happen?

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It got so bad, I left.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:10%
And a week later,
I had this event

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:10%
where-- and it was
a full-on spiritual

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:10%
knock you to the floor
event where I made contact

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:10%
with the Circle of Light.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.583 align:middle line:90%
And it had happened--

00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
it actually happened
with another friend

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of mine who was-- had
found this thing called

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
a Pathfinder, which is like
a shamanistic talking board.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
It was like a Ouija board,
but it was all in the light.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And she could sit
there by herself

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and the spirits
would come through.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.227 align:middle line:84%
And she would just
hold this disk,

00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:24.768 align:middle line:84%
and it would spin
around, and around,

00:05:24.768 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and around, and
get, like, pages.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I would sit there like the
secretary, spirit secretary,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and write out this kind
of spirit dictation coming

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And through that board
they had been saying to her

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
we can give you a lot
more information if you

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:90%
let us speak through you.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So we were-- at the same time,
we were listening to Abraham,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:90%
That had kind of come our way.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I actually--

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this someone that was
in your circle of Comedy Store

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:90%
friends?

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This was actually a girl
I met in Portugal who is one

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
of the girls who said, you
should come to America and be

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:90%
a stand-up comic.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
So I did that whole thing.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So we were friends.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And we just were kind of into
the spiritual stuff together

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and just really like,
what's going on?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.083 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is this?

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is happening?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And then someone had
switched her onto Abraham,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:90%
and we were like, whoa.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we actually
went to see Abraham.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of the people
that Abraham pulled up out

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:90%
of the audience.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I got to
speak to Abraham.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do think there was
an energetic transfer that

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.055 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, looking
back I was, like--

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What year was this?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It was-- I think it was 2004.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:10%
So there were things kind
of building up to it.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But through the
board, they were saying--

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
really, I just thought
to her, like, we

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
want to speak through
you, my friend.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, cool.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
This is so cool.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.225 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we weren't afraid.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
We had seen this kind of
positive example of channeling.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, you know, one
week when I went down to visit

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
her and they had come through
another time when she visited

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
me and started
pushing the energy in.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And she was feeling
weird and kind of going,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
wow, this is really weird.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But she just was
kind of going like--

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't
verbalize it, right?

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So the next time I went down
to visit her, there was a--

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
there's masses of energy here.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing it down, like
the secretary, you know?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel a little weird.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:90%
You'll make some strange noises.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Masses of energy, you'll
feel a little weird.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.722 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I just
went, oh my god.

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I think it's happening to me.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And this wave of
energy came through,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
like a full charge
of energy came in.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I just dropped down
into an instant trance.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you came up, and
they were like, we are here.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We want to speak through you.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Your friend must have
been freaked out.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It was wild.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It was one of the
wildest weekends of my life.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Because it was just, like, nuts.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
It was completely nuts.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:10%
So when this event happened,
I went from being just pretty,

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:10%
like, five physical senses--

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> To, you know, feeling
all my chakras blow open.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:10%
Buzzing hands.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:10%
It was just-- it was
a night and day thing.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:90%
And the energies came in.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.518 align:middle line:90%
And then through me--

00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and I think because
I was a comedian,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.625 align:middle line:90%
I could just speak the energies.

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:22.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:90%
I was just an open champion.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Comedians sort of a
channel anyways, right?

00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:27.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's right.

00:08:27.203 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, you do improv, and
things are just coming to you.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going through
your conscious mind so much.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
It's just coming out.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.512 align:middle line:84%
Whereas my friend is
very open in the hands.

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:90%
She was a wonderful painter.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:10%
Which is why I think she
could did this thing.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:10%
And she could also type channel.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:10%
>> And that came easy to her.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:10%
But I was-- they, through
me, were able to talk her

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:10%
through a relaxation.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.065 align:middle line:84%
And then she started verbally
channeling on this weekend.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:53.865 align:middle line:90%
So there were--

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> At the same time?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:90%
This same weekend?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It was the craziest time, right?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> This is like, you know,
channeling girls gone wild.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.812 align:middle line:90%
>> It totally was.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:90%
We were just like--

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Spring break
in-- where were you?

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
San Diego?

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Spring break in San Diego.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:07.722 align:middle line:90%
>> It was crazy.

00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It really was crazy.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So we-- so they came through.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.198 align:middle line:90%
And they came through--

00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because they really
blasted us open.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.085 align:middle line:84%
They came through
massive energy.

00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:16.132 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I was,
like, moving around

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.585 align:middle line:10%
like a mad woman and everything.

00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:20.385 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:10%
>> And then they-- you know,
they would pop over into her.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.633 align:middle line:90%
And they'd be, like, you know--

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the same Circle
would pop to her?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
They were popping between us.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.388 align:middle line:84%
They were popping-- like,
say they're be in me,

00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:31.385 align:middle line:90%
and then they'd go--

00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:90%
well, then they'd pop over.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I would talk her through, and
then she'd start channeling.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I remember
very clearly her channeling

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then just going,
transferring energies.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.305 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly--

00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'd love to
have a camera on that.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we did video.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:90%
It was videoed?

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> We-- somewhere.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you want to see it.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.586 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I didn't know--

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:10%
>> We are going to--

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Because we're just, like, a
couple of chicks hanging out,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So because they
started to say--

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we want
you to document this.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.893 align:middle line:90%
So bring your friend over.

00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.353 align:middle line:90%
You had a friend to document it?

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> She came over the next
day with her video camera.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was so much
energy in this room.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.297 align:middle line:84%
>> We would go out
onto the balcony.

00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were, like,
smoking cigarettes,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
because we were just, like,
what is going on in there?

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And it was the only way
to kind of slow it down.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.432 align:middle line:84%
And we would walk back into
the room and just be like--

00:10:29.432 --> 00:10:30.638 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.638 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, the energies
were just so strong.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Literally, got
knocked to the floor.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, it would literally
knock you to the floor when--

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and they were busting
through, right?

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I went to,
like, a channeling class

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.113 align:middle line:90%
and slowly developed this thing.

00:10:42.113 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:90%
It was like a--

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:90%
we're here thing.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why it's
called the event.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why it's
called the event.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was two or three days?

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It was two days.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So I-- the day they
first came through,

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was
staying the night.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And my friend went to go and
get coffee in the morning.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:10%
You know, I woke up
and she had gone.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started feeling these,
like, little hands all over me.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying, you
know, we're clearing you.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:90%
We're clearing you.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:90%
We're healing you.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
We're clearing you.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like--

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This was an audible
voice in your ear?

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, you know, in your
inner mind, I guess, you know?

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was, like,
well, maybe we should

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:90%
wait till Lisa comes back.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, I don't
really, like-- is this cool?

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:90%
So but, no.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It was lovely.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.015 align:middle line:84%
It was very, you
know, like, these kind

00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of little angel hands.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, the friend

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
came and with the video camera.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What did she think?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, what did
any of us think?

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:39.625 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Literally, the footage
would be, you know,

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:47.352 align:middle line:84%
the energy would
be in one of us,

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and the other one basically
just like looking in the camera

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:90%
going--

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.370 align:middle line:90%
[MOUTHING WORDS]

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It was just so mental.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But we-- we had an
open heart about it.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:10%
And then I went back
to LA, and I didn't

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:10%
think I could do it by myself.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:10%
I thought we needed the board.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:10%
I thought we needed
to be together.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And then, you know, as a--

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I actually had one of
those boards myself.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.615 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do it like she
did, but I opened it up.

00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was all like--

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
--In the middle.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, I
realized I could do it

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:90%
without my friend, Lisa.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:90%
We went through a long--

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I talked about it in--

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I can plug the podcast,
right, that we've got this--

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
We just did-- we just
recorded the podcast.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We just recorded an episode
of the podcast that I've got

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:10%
coming out, called "Coming
Out of the Cosmic Closet."

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:10%
And I talk quite a lot about
that in the first two episodes.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, great.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> The event.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then what we had
to do to really trust

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:90%
that this was happening.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it's so--

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
part of me, of
course, is like, am I

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.907 align:middle line:84%
just making this up to
get attention, you know?

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
This bad stuff happened
at the Comedy Store.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.025 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm looking for
a new angle to, like,

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:90%
get some attention.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a whole
process to really go.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Am I mad?

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not mad.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Can I trust this?

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Is this real?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:10%
Because we did just sound like--

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:10%
initially, that we were just
kind of regurgitating, like,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.935 align:middle line:10%
Abraham and stuff.

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:15.735 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, OK.

00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, it
took a while for--

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:10%
you know, when you
start channeling,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:10%
they really have to
prepare you to receive

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:10%
different information.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And you have to, like--

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, the neural pathways
have to get rewired and fired.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to open the vessel.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So it took a little
while before I was really

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
getting the body of work that
is really the body of work

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that I bring through
with the Circle.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So after this event episode--

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> How long did you stay at the
Comedy Store before you left?

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Pretty soon?

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I left.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I had to leave the
Comedy Store, I really

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:90%
think, for this event to happen.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, so this was leaving.

00:13:52.905 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then literally,
a week after?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Literally a week after.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Man.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And it very much was--
because the Comedy Store is,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:90%
like, super haunted.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was a very
dense energy there.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did struggle
with my comedy there, I think,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:90%
because I had to really--

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, you don't realize
how energy sensitive

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:90%
you are until you have an event.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And then now you're
actually viscerally feeling

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:90%
your sensitivity a lot more.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:10%
And so I think there
wasn't really a--

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it wouldn't
be energetically

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:10%
healthy, I suppose, for
me to open up like that

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and still be going
into that environment.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's just a really--
it's a haunted you know--

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you probably-- again,
you had to get away from that

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.036 align:middle line:90%
for this event to happen.

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>> For this event to happen.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And vice versa.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why I say it's
kind of-- it was really about

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.622 align:middle line:84%
a learning lesson
about the good ego.

00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you're
really in your-- like,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the right thing
by staying here and being

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:84%
in this-- this fight for
womankind too, you know--

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was actually
holding back an aspect of--

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:90%
or delaying--

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> This greater event
that wanted to happen.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.523 align:middle line:84%
>> So after that, how soon did
the channeling become a thing

00:15:01.523 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
where you're-- like, you're
doing hosting private sessions

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:90%
now and doing this.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I worked with it.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:10%
I sort of started having
people come over and do

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:10%
kind of sessions quite quickly
really, when I was still,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:10%
you know, adapting with the
energy and stuff like that.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:10%
But I had a good friend whose
house I would go over to.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:10%
And she was really into
it, and she loved Abraham.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And she would just sit
with me and ask questions.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of the times--

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, we would
go into silence, actually,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and just these kind of
preparatory transmissions

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%
were coming through.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And that helped to build
my confidence to start.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.826 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said,
I went from being,

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, someone who's not
having these experiences--

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
--To full on being blasted open.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> After the event, it
continued, this craziness?

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the craziness continued.

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.185 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really do go into
that a lot in the podcast.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:84%
"Coming Out of the
Cosmic Closet," all--

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:90%
like, how we kind of tested it.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of things
happened Yeah.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you
know, now I'm in LA.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
In the mornings,
I'm channeling, you

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
know, partly like archangel
Michael and these advanced

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:90%
consciousnesses.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember who
identified themselves

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.108 align:middle line:90%
as a part of the first crew.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then at night,
then I'm working at, like,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
catering jobs.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know, really
like scumming out.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't like--

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you still had
to pay the bills, right?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Still had to pay the bills.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.645 align:middle line:90%
>> So you just did odd jobs.

00:16:25.645 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Still living in reality.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Just doing that.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But I did start
working with clients.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And then-- and yeah.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Probably it wasn't really
until I moved to New York

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in 2008, I think it was,
that I totally started

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:90%
making my money off this.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.915 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the
motivation to go to New York?

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:49.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think I was
sent there, to be honest.

00:16:49.915 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Because a lot of the
work that we do is this kind

00:16:52.757 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:90%
of planetary healing work.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:10%
So I had actually just gone
to New York for a birthday

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:10%
weekend, and just
had, like, a blast.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And I felt--

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
I actually really loved
LA, but when I came back,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I just felt my time
there was complete.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I'd gone through
some very difficult things with

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.385 align:middle line:84%
the Comedy Store and
the entertainment.

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
As a city, you know, a
lot of amazing things

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
happen, like,
spiritually actually.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:10%
And I actually loved LA.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt complete, and
that was a nice way to leave.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:25.911 align:middle line:84%
And then someone rear ended
me and destroyed my car.

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
And that was really,
like, the, OK.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.835 align:middle line:90%
You're going now to New York.

00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's back it
up a little bit.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Because before you
went to LA, you're

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:90%
originally from Australia.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.035 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm originally
from Australia.

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> We didn't even get to that.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Originally from Australia.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I left Australia to do the
walk about, met this girl

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Lisa in Portugal.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And she was, like, come
to America and be a comedian.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.745 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was, like, OK.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.268 align:middle line:84%
>> So before America,
there was Portugal.

00:17:47.268 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There was Portugal,
there was England.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And then I came to America.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And then-- yeah.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:10%
>> And growing up in Australia,
that's where you sort of had

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.373 align:middle line:10%
an interest, but never had the--

00:17:59.373 --> 00:18:00.173 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:18:00.173 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:10%
And now I look back on it.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:10%
When I was a little kid, I
did have invisible friends.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm pretty sure I was
communicating with an energy

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%
I had my imaginary friend.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, my
sister didn't have one.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And she-- I was like, we'll
just have one, you know?

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine it.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:10%
But now I think whatever I
was connecting with was--

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.545 align:middle line:10%
and then we moved to Perth.

00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:10%
And we moved into a house
which I think was also haunted.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.935 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's when
that shut down actually.

00:18:29.935 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:10%
And then there was sort
of a difficult period

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:10%
of my childhood and my life.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I was, on that
energetic front, shut down.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But the curiosity
about consciousness.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Even-- because, look, I
converted to Catholicism.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But in year 10, I learned
about reincarnation.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, well, that makes a
lot more sense to me, you know?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So then I-- you
know, there was--

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
there was always the
whatever you call it,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
like, just the resonance
with it, basically.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.133 align:middle line:84%
But you're just trying to access
whatever is closest to you,

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
you know, at that time.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever information
you can kind of get to.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So at first, it was being--
you know, going to church.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it was learning
about reincarnation.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
my step mother

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:90%
gave me a book on palmistry.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:10%
Then it was that.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And then it was astrology.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And then it was--

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:10%
you know, all the
little bad seeds

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:10%
before you eat the
whole bread roll.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Before you have an event.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Before you have an event.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So Australia, Portugal,
Los Angeles, New York.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> New York.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Now we're back in New York.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Back in New York.

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:40.313 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Then, yeah, I was in New York.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.728 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:19:43.728 --> 00:19:45.395 align:middle line:84%
I really think I was
kind of sent there.

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:46.195 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:46.195 --> 00:19:47.116 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And doing this work?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing this work.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And really, just doing
energetic cleanup work.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So once I-- you know, the kind
of the voice of the Circle

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of this material
about, you know, the shifting

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.950 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and dissolving
the old, primitive mind

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
framework that really does
seed a lot of the worst, quote

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
unquote, issues of the
planet, which is the survival

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that really
puts us into polarity

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and plays out in-- in
a sort of epic problem

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:90%
stories of the planet.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.672 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, poverty,
starvation, slavery, war.

00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it moved from just
kind of law of attraction when

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I won stuff to how the
matrix of reality works.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the
frameworks that create?

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
What we see is the
storylines on top.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the deep, underlying
frameworks that are seeding

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
those stories?

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So we work a lot with
what is down here.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>> To clean up what is up here.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:10%
But just generally, bopping
around and bringing the high

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:10%
frequencies into different--
kind of anchoring the high

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:10%
frequencies into different
places on the planet,

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:10%
which I think a lot of--

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.527 align:middle line:10%
well, there's
different people who

00:21:09.527 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:10%
are doing different
forms of channeling work.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that
after my having

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
this sort of
spiritual event in LA,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
then New York is such a
melting pot of humanity.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think also being a
comic and my personality made

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
me, like, robust enough to be
a very energetically-sensitive

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:90%
person in a place like New York.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Where I think you
have maybe more channels

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:10%
and energy-sensitive people that
would find it even more hard

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:10%
going than I would.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> They would find it more what?

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard going.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard going.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> To be in just
such intense energy.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, like
grinding, intense energy.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:90%
New York can be intense.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's intense.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, any dense city.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:10%
>> It's once you start
becoming energy sensitive--

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>> You kind of like
to get away from it.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be
difficult for people.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.815 align:middle line:84%
It can be difficult. And I'm
an extrovert, so that helps.

00:21:59.815 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And I-- I just--

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that was what I kind of came
to, is, like, I was just more--

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness was more robust
enough to handle being there,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.962 align:middle line:84%
opening up the gateways,
bringing the energy in.

00:22:11.962 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the Comedy Store sort
of prepped you a little bit,

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:10%
huh?

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:10%
Probably.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.232 align:middle line:10%
You know, there was
definitely, you know--

00:22:20.232 --> 00:22:24.492 align:middle line:10%
well, we just reincarnate with
probably what we need to do,

00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:10%
what we don't even know
that we're going to do.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And what-- yeah.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
With New York, you're
very tapped into humanity.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
You're on the subway
with everyone.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love--

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I love New York for this.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is also in some way an
incredibly heart-opening place

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because even though it's intense
and there's a lot of energy

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
there, polarity
actually can't last

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that long there, in
terms of-- you know,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
particularly when you look at
people, like racism and things

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone's on the subway.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Humanity is right there.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your preconceptions are
about what this sort of person

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.678 align:middle line:84%
is or what that
sort of person is,

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
once you're all riding
the subway together,

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
you're just like, oh,
we're just people.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:10%
And I really--

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:10%
I really feel that
that's why people

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:10%
feel that I heart New
York thing, because it

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:10%
forces us to confront
our lives and separation.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And really just see people.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Just see people for people.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And be-- yeah.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's-- so I
treasure my time there.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.265 align:middle line:84%
But it was also
very challenging.

00:23:24.265 --> 00:23:25.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how long were you
there before you made this move?

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.112 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.112 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was there for eight
and a half years as well.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.692 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be my cutoff.

00:23:32.692 --> 00:23:33.492 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:34.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:34.292 --> 00:23:37.718 align:middle line:84%
I haven't lived anywhere in one
place, anywhere in the world,

00:23:37.718 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:90%
for more than eight yeas.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So even as a child,
we lived in Africa

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and lived in Papua New Guinea.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Lived in several
places in Australia.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I had discovered Hawaii
doing hula hooping.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Came out here to do
hula hooping retreat.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Ended up holding my
own hula hooping retreat.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiritual cross
hula hooping retreat.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And then came over here to Oahu.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:10%
And the second day
I was here or so,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:10%
I met some people who were
working at the skydiving place.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I
discovered skydiving.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started me
bringing back-- bringing me

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:90%
back here in the winters.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> To skydive
through the winter,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and to kind of get
out of New York--

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --Through the winter.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And then when things
just really fell sort of--

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:10%
I'd lost my apartment
in New York.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:10%
New York just
started, like, ending.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:10%
It was just an easy, very
easy, move for me to come here.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I already
had a car out here.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
I was already--

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Somewhat integrated?

00:24:35.088 --> 00:24:35.888 align:middle line:90%
>> I was already--

00:24:35.888 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I already had this community
of skydiver friends.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like, oh.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I lost my apartment.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.414 align:middle line:90%
See ya.

00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the
draw to skydiving?

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Skydiving has been a very
amazing experience for me.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So a big part of
the work that we do

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
is this primitive-mind
consciousness part

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and dissolving the influence
of the primitive mind

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and the nervous system
on how it shapes

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
our beliefs about ourselves
and our beliefs about reality.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the primitive
mind is probably

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:84%
the most contracted aspect
of the human consciousness

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
that super survival.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Right,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Like, you're my enemy.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:90%
It's very polarized.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
It's very focused on the--

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of, like,
Neanderthal kind of.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Neanderthal.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.655 align:middle line:90%
Like the caveman mentality.

00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:21.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:21.455 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a deep part
of our programming.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't realize
how much it is influencing

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to our world.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So when-- you know, when someone
feels like they can't change

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:90%
their career--

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Or they have resistance
to changing their career,

00:25:37.487 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
very unhappy,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.037 align:middle line:84%
it's the survival mind
underneath saying,

00:25:41.037 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to die if you
do something different.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:43.365 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Or if you--

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:10%
say you're doing something
very accepted by the family,

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:10%
but you really want to go and
become a heavy metal artist.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
The survival mind is saying,
if I go and follow this dream,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll be rejected by
my tribe and I'll die.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And it-- there's a big, big
zeitgeist of emotions that come

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, how we suppress
our primitive mind emotions--

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear, and anger,
hatred, but also grief,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:90%
fear of abandonment, and shame.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
How we suppress those
in the body mind

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:84%
is what causes a lot of our
chronic physical illness.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> As well, which is one of the
specialties that we work with.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
With-- you know, in the
healing practice that I do.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Does any of that
transfer to pre-human?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, we
always hear in my series

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki is
sort of a theme, right?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Of us being seeded here,
and enslaved, and all that.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Does that come into
the mix at all?

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never received
information about that.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:10%
And I think the way
I receive information

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:10%
about what created the planet--

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Mhm.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that it's all
a creative choice.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And that these frameworks
are put into place.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:10%
The way the information comes
through with the Circle is it--

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:10%
it sort of avoids all talk of
sides, if that makes sense.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And good and bad.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So the way it's really
presented a lot more--

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
like, one thing that
I've channeled about

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is that when this
stage was set to have

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
this creative experience that
we call the human experience--

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --One of the creative choices
was to have 12 viral strains

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that all illness and disease
would kind of come from.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.572 align:middle line:90%
>> And that that--

00:27:44.572 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and you know, in all
these different kind

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:90%
of manifestations.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
about that there

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
would be the
intelligence of illness,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
would be part of
the human story.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But what that story is about is
it was about creating lifespan.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So when consciousness
incarnates to have

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:90%
an experience, based on--

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, at different periods
of time, if you incarnated,

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
there, like, wasn't
that much to do.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think incarnated
as, like, a medieval farmer--

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, thirty years
is probably good, right?

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's enough.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:90%
So how do we have lifespan?

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We have these programs
of entropy and decay.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.417 align:middle line:84%
>> And disease, and illness,
and that sort of stuff.

00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of the
whatever you want to call it.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
The intelligent design
of this human experience.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> This play, this TV show--

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --Of life that
we're going to have.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.840 align:middle line:10%
So I guess some people
might say, well,

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:10%
the writers of that show
were mean to write that in

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:10%
or something.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But for me or how I've
always received it,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
it's just very much being, like,
this was an experience created.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in the middle
of changing the storyline.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're going from a cop show
to a science-fiction show.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from a, you
know, primitive-mind driven,

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:84%
singular, linear, time-space
reality storyline.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
All the storylines that
can come from that,

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:84%
which includes the stories
that stem from survival

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, which is war.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's made a
lot of storylines.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Tons of storylines.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> How many more movies do we--

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> How many more movies?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And that was really the thing.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we're
done with-- you know,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:84%
we've sort of explored
all these storylines.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So as a collective
consciousness,

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
decided to shift it.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.507 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just blowing
it up and being like, OK--

00:29:42.507 --> 00:29:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Start over again.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Start over.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
a set change.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> While we're still incarnated.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:47.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:47.755 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Which is so cool, right?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is cool.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So people were, like, you
know, in the cop show--

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What's going on?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:52.266 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> The stage pieces.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There's actually--
and they're moving.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly it.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Am I part of this stage?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
That's totally it.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That's part of
us working it out.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.855 align:middle line:90%
>> That's part of it.

00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And this whole struggle
that we're having

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:90%
with polarity right now--

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And that the fake news and
all this other stuff is that

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
this is a projection of the
going mind going, I can't.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't combine these
realities into one piece.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's
the old reality,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's a new
reality moving in.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And because I
can't reconcile this,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm creating polarity
everywhere, right?

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And seeing polarity.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of this
process of trying to merge back

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
into one consensual reality we
can all more or less agree on.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been in the
consensual reality.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We've got-- like, where
we've pretty much have all

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
consented, mostly,
that we have a life

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:90%
span that lasts this long.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, we have--

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're constantly
retelling the story

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because our new discoveries are
showing that we can extend life

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:90%
this much longer.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is--

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --With these new habits,
and doing this thing,

00:30:58.790 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and that thing.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening in
the rewriting of that--

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's the work that
I do with the Circle--

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we're dissolving
those programs as well.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've got the energy
work coming in, going,

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:84%
this old program of
entropy and decay--

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --Is part of the
old slate of stories.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't actually
need it anymore.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So we do that.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:10%
We dissolve the programs
of entropy and decay.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously, we have
this manifestation of, you know,

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.675 align:middle line:84%
surgeries that make
us look younger.

00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Light technologies that
make us look younger.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Meditation that
makes us look young.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, all of these things.

00:31:33.938 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, that
was just, like, a new--

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I did this retreat, and it
was all about, you know,

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.845 align:middle line:84%
shifting consciousness,
shifting my consciousness

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and opening up to
a new framework.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I discovered skydiving.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And a whole wonderful new world
for Georgia, the human being,

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.310 align:middle line:90%
opened up.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But also because my work was so
much about the nervous system

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and watching how the nervous
system controls people.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:10%
It was a really good way for me
to really viscerally experience

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:10%
the influence of what I
call biological thinking.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:10%
How when our nervous
system kicks in,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:10%
it controls our thinking.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And that may be subtle.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I'm too
embarrassed to be a comedian,

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
or I'm too embarrassed
to change jobs,

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
or I'm too afraid
to change jobs.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's where it's
operating for most people.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's just, like, this
subtle form of resistance

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that's inhibiting people
from making changes.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So the more I can
understand that--

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
happening with humanity,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of
mayhem that we're seeing

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is that we have new
frequencies moving in.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system in
our old, human biology

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:90%
isn't recognizing it.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's going,
danger, danger.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And how that then projects
out into our reality is these

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
storylines that the
world is about to end.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That we are under threat.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But what-- that's the old
egoic mind feeling the threat

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:90%
of the new energies moving in.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of
going through this,

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:84%
like being able to
integrate it all.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when you get
through the illusion,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.108 align:middle line:84%
then you come to the next level
of knowingness and the next

00:33:15.108 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So when I go
skydiving, I'm always

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
challenging the most contracted
aspect of my consciousness,

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.560 align:middle line:84%
which is my nervous
system, to transcend.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:84%
My first lessons
I was told I was

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the people in the world
who probably can't skydive,

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:90%
whose brain can't do it.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So it immediately planted
a huge amount of fear.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And that process
of overcoming that.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And if my brain couldn't handle
it, training it to handle it.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Was such that when I had
those breakthrough skydives,

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:84%
it was very much like
a spiritual experience.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I had transcended this kind
of biological limitation.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
is happening in humanity.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Plus, it's a riot.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's awesome fun.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But why was I drawn
to skydiving as part

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of my spiritual work?

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It really was to look at
this-- this contracted aspect

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:84%
>> So skydiving--
you know, this--

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the adrenaline, right, and
being on edge, like you said,

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
>> You're still kind of
finding that inner peace.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's just--

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:84%
it's still-- you know, I've
done lots of work on myself.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a daily practice.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I think being a channel,
you have to be--

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It's your responsibility as a
channel to always be working on

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:90%
yourself, you know?

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:36.275 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
do, the wider the--

00:34:36.275 --> 00:34:39.512 align:middle line:84%
you know, the bigger
the frequencies

00:34:39.512 --> 00:34:40.554 align:middle line:90%
are that can come though.

00:34:40.554 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
frequencies come through,

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.739 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to
push everything out.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:44.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
>> So I like skydiving because
it continues to reveal to me

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.580 align:middle line:84%
where my ego is,
where-- you know,

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
where the denser aspects of
my consciousness is still

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:90%
residing.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:90%
And I can keep working on it.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I first
started channeling,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and this will happen
to a lot of people

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:84%
who go through this spiritual
awakening, you're like, oh.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.020 align:middle line:90%
This is really amazing.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly, all these
really intense emotions

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:10%
are coming up.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a massive
clearing of the inner house

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.210 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And that really is
a continuing process

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
for me, of being a channel,
to keep doing that work.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:90%
So I can still--

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I can still easily observe
myself on the drops,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:90%
like, getting all like--

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
--The polarity
coming through again.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Just because I see
my nervous system

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
is more activated
under those conditions,

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's controlling
my thinking.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.533 align:middle line:84%
>> When you said you got to
check your ego in, what do--

00:35:41.533 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, here's the
thing about the nervous system

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that one learns as-- as you
know, as you work with it more,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:84%
is-- and this a
piece of biology.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So and our biology,
from a survival sense,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:90%
is here to put us in survival.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's there to override
whatever spiritual conscious,

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, aspect of ourselves,
heart-centered aspect

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that
we've developed.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're under threat,
the biology is there to kick

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.610 align:middle line:84%
in and give you energy
to, like, escape.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> A murderer or whatever.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> The adrenaline.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the adrenaline.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> The dopamine, the endorphins.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> All of that.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have, on
the other side, the bonding

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.620 align:middle line:84%
emotions, which is the fear
of abandonment and shame.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're the-- they're the--

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:84%
they're the biological
emotions that drive us to bond

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.600 align:middle line:90%
and stay connected to the tribe.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- and people don't
really understand that side

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of it very much.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Jealousy, shame.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
This is all about, you know,
getting in the right pecking

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:90%
order.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is a real,
you know, body

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:90%
of work of exploration for me.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm on the drop zone
and my adrenaline is up,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:02.210 align:middle line:84%
or my nervous system is more
active because I'm skydiving,

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and somebody says
something to me.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.860 align:middle line:90%
How I'll respond to that under--

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.842 align:middle line:84%
in that state is very
different from how

00:37:09.842 --> 00:37:11.675 align:middle line:84%
I will respond to it
when I'm in a full stay

00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and play mode like this.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We're hanging on the beach.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're hanging
on the beach.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be like,
you know, whatever.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
looking for a threat.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not looking for--

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:84%
when my nervous-- and
this is what PTSD is.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.500 align:middle line:84%
When the nervous
system is active,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:90%
it's looking for a threat.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's tending to polarize.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the biological thinking.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, again, what
we're seeing on the planet

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:84%
right now is that the incoming
new frequencies are posing

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
a threat to the
nervous system, which

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
is putting people in a
highly-polarized state,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.493 align:middle line:90%
and they're looking for enemies.

00:37:46.493 --> 00:37:47.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:47.293 --> 00:37:49.205 align:middle line:84%
>> They're looking in
religion, in gender.

00:37:49.205 --> 00:37:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> In thing.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And in an internet
comment on Facebook.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And in an internet
comment on Facebook.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's triggering
so many people.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You are the devil
if you've done-- yeah.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Because-- and it's just--

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.203 align:middle line:84%
I think this is just, so,
like not understood for people

00:38:05.203 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:90%
who are watching this.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:11.418 align:middle line:84%
>> It is probably one of
the most vital aspects

00:38:11.418 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to understand,
if you are going to have some

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:90%
kind of spiritual evolution.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to address
this base level of consciousness

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that is controlling us
so much behaviorally.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:10%
And we see that in the kind of
uprise of tribalism in the--

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:10%
you know, in the
political landscape.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, the immigrants
are the enemy,

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or the this is the enemy,
or that is the enemy.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:84%
That if we don't address
and have mindfulness,

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know if
I will ever in my life

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
overcome my nervous system's
biological functioning.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that biologically
we can move energy completely.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But a compassion self
view is to also be like,

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
maybe I will never--

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I don't have to
win the nervous system to be

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.640 align:middle line:90%
in love, right?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Or to be-- and
spiritualism can also--

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.595 align:middle line:84%
the good ego can kick
in and be like, well,

00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:14.005 align:middle line:90%
you have to be perfect to be--

00:39:14.005 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to be allowed to have this.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.070 align:middle line:10%
You have to conquer
your nervous system,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:10%
or you can't experience
connection with the oneness.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you are mindful and if
you are aware that this aspect

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
about programming has such a
massive impact on our daily

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:90%
interactions.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But also, how it is
getting projected even

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
into the metaphysical,
which can then

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:84%
start to become a boundary
and a blocking point

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.880 align:middle line:84%
from being able to transcend
that ultimate illusion

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:90%
or polarity.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a really important part.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It's an important piece of
consciousness to understand,

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There's lots of
important pieces, but--

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge one,
especially right now.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially
right now because--

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
because humanity innately
feels under threat

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
by the unknown, which is
this energy that's moving in.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you are aware of it--
and a lot of on my website,

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.510 align:middle line:84%
www.circleevolution.com,
if I can plug that.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.455 align:middle line:90%
>> I have-- we have--

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have, like, over
500 recordings and energy

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:84%
atunements that is where
all this information is

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:90%
coming from.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But it also worked to help
open up the nervous system.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Because people are trying
to bring in more energy,

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.250 align:middle line:84%
bring in more
consciousness, and you've

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:84%
got a contracted nervous
system going, no, no, no.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what's making it
so difficult for people

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.320 align:middle line:90%
to open up.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they don't know
how to open up that primary,

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
deep piece of programming enough
to allow this stuff to come

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:90%
in and be accepted.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, actually start
to come into manifestation.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Like the whole magic
of the 5-D grid.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:10%
The whole-- the magical
potentiality of-- of--

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:10%
you know, everyone's
kind of waiting

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.427 align:middle line:10%
for this big spiritual event
where we're all telepathic,

00:41:01.427 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:10%
and we're all connected, and
we're teleporting and stuff

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a biological
process that's

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:90%
happening that is adaptive.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe that will be a
big, fat event one day.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.505 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ruling it out.

00:41:12.505 --> 00:41:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> You had your event, you know?

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> To a point.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:90%
But I am not living--

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:90%
You still had to integrate.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm not living in multi
dimensionality all the time.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>> You are Reuben, and we're
having this conversation

00:41:22.693 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:90%
through our physical senses.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, even though
there's frequencies coming out

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
of this--

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not telepathically
connected yet.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of
people have-- you know,

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.750 align:middle line:84%
when 2012 came around, you know,
they're like, oh, the whole--

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything's
going to be gone.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It going to be this.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to be this.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:37.967 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the new day?

00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Like 2025 or something?

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, that's,
you know, the event.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:42.655 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there's
going to be an event.

00:41:42.655 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There's going to be a
big solar thing happening.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Or something.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is going blow up.

00:41:46.272 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody is going to be
instantaneously transformed

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And telepathic or whatever.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.633 align:middle line:84%
And I think people are
feeling the energy of that.

00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:54.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:41:54.433 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So they feel that excitement.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:90%
They want it to happen.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But the adaptation
process of our biology

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and also just for our
consciousness to handle it

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and to kind of be
able to enjoy it.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:07.772 align:middle line:90%
Without short circuiting.

00:42:07.772 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Without short
circuiting and just being--

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.510 align:middle line:84%
because even having
the event to channel--

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.727 align:middle line:84%
>> --Was enough that I had to
go through a lot of adaptive

00:42:15.727 --> 00:42:19.650 align:middle line:84%
crisis to trust it and to
feel safe with the process.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think big things
happen, little things happen.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're in an
adaptive process.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:84%
The set is getting changed
while we're still acting.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you can understand
some of the ways

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to calm the old egoic body-mind
system, the nervous system

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Learn how to open up.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Let the frequencies come
in, and allow yourself

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.905 align:middle line:90%
this adaptive process.

00:42:42.905 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I think if you
incorporate all that,

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:84%
then the magical
stuff actually starts

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.320 align:middle line:90%
happening a little bit sooner.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it starts
to just happen in life.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's an integrated
part of your existence

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.240 align:middle line:90%
rather than like, now.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, the big thing.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a big thing, you know?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Which still happens.

00:43:03.022 --> 00:43:04.230 align:middle line:90%
You still get to a big thing.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I had a big thing.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.462 align:middle line:90%
Like, it was definitely--

00:43:06.462 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm having big
things all the time,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's not like
all, like, you--

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it comes.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.442 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
your, you know,

00:43:15.442 --> 00:43:16.650 align:middle line:10%
you have to go do the dishes.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to go do
the dishes, right?

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.255 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- and really,
if you're in a good zone,

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the dishes are just
a fine as anything.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've noticed, is
the more you're in this zone--

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.733 align:middle line:84%
>> --The more you
integrate all this stuff--

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --The dishes are fun to do.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.037 align:middle line:90%
>> The dishes are fun.

00:43:34.037 --> 00:43:36.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a good space,
everything is fun, you know?

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But-- but this is-- you
know, it's an important thing

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to understand, that as that
old consciousness is coming up,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and the fear, and
shame, and all the--

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
the reservoir, the collective
memories of these emotions.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And these what we call the grids
that create creation, which

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.260 align:middle line:84%
are these sort of big
energetic frameworks

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that have held the
stories of reality

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
in place, as that-- as
all of that is coming up,

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going through a process
of taking all the energy that

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.875 align:middle line:84%
was in that and purifying it
to feed the new framework,

00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:12.675 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:12.675 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Energy can't be
destroyed or created.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to get the
energy from something,

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:90%
which is all the old story.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are very
challenging aspects

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of integrating
what feels like all

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:90%
that dense, old, primal emotion.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.353 align:middle line:84%
>> And having tools that helps
that-- that sort of process.

00:44:29.353 --> 00:44:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And really understanding
what's going on

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.562 align:middle line:84%
can bring a little--
a lot more grace

00:44:32.562 --> 00:44:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to the process of
people who are here

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.268 align:middle line:84%
to support this kind
of evolutionary shift,

00:44:38.268 --> 00:44:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and do that kind of work,
and go through their own kind

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.935 align:middle line:84%
of, whatever you
want to call it,

00:44:41.935 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:84%
ascension process,
enlightenment.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Whatever your name is for it.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, grace is a
big-- that's a big--

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I had several
downloads in regard

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to that, as far as operate
from a place of grace.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes grace
is it's OK that I'm

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.380 align:middle line:90%
freaking out right now.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a moment of acceptance.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.683 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a great movie.

00:45:01.683 --> 00:45:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Who was that director?

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Paul Anderson, I think.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:84%
He did the "The Train," the
movie where-- not "The Train."

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.920 align:middle line:90%
"The Hotel."

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> "The Hotel."

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.445 align:middle line:90%
>> You know that one?

00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I know-- have I seen it?

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> He's this bell man.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's these extreme
situations and all that.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But he's always, like,
operating from a place of grace.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.477 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, yes.

00:45:19.477 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:84%
That's such a valuable
message, right?

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And grace is, you know,
when we're in non judgment.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, we-- like, the
dishes are not good or bad.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:90%
This is all just energy.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.972 align:middle line:84%
So even the uncomfortable
feelings as they're emerging

00:45:33.972 --> 00:45:35.430 align:middle line:84%
are not good or
bad, and you're not

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.840 align:middle line:90%
good or bad for having them.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Even though it may be
uncomfortable to have your--

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.970 align:middle line:90%
when I started channeling, yes.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:90%
The anger had to come up.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:90%
The rage.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was embedded
in me that was now--

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:84%
the higher frequencies
was activating

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to move up, like, you know,
the dense ice cubes coming up.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Had to come up and be--

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.510 align:middle line:84%
not just gotten rid
of, because then you're

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.270 align:middle line:84%
missing the big source
of energy that's there.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Process, integrate
it, and expanded with,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.330 align:middle line:84%
which I might be going
a little bit too much.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's just
say, there's a lot.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:90%
A lot that goes into this.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll definitely,
when the Circle comes through--

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll get into some of this.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Every time the mind is
threatened by the new level

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, that--

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that survival mind
starts to kick up.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So even if I go from here's
Georgia, a single person,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.590 align:middle line:84%
to here's Georgia who has
had multiple lifetimes,

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to here's Georgia,
that is connected to--

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
has, you know, galactic
energies, to here's Georgia

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.145 align:middle line:84%
and she's the creator
of everything.

00:46:41.145 --> 00:46:41.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:46:41.945 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Each one of those shifts is
a threat to my singular egoic

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:90%
identity's consciousness.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's very often
a survival mind reaction

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.265 align:middle line:84%
at each of those
initiation points.

00:46:53.265 --> 00:46:54.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:54.065 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is just a by the by.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's a lot of
the work that we do,

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:84%
is guide people through
those initiation points,

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:90%
which may come as an illness.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.057 align:middle line:84%
It might come as a
relationship breakup.

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It might come as a career thing.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is driving
people crazy.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.910 align:middle line:84%
If the mind doesn't
know what's going on,

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
it's often indicated that people
are going through an initiation

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.220 align:middle line:84%
into the next level
of consciousness,

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.878 align:middle line:84%
which is unknowable
to their current mind.

00:47:20.878 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So that's happening personally.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It's happening collectively.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.600 align:middle line:90%
But I think we are about to--

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.990 align:middle line:84%
there is certainly a lot
more people opening up.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It is getting exponential in
such a way that I think we will

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
have more, like, event-looking
like experiences,

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.350 align:middle line:84%
where bigger collectives
are kind of, you know--

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess more things can
happen if we all allow them to.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, if we--

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.955 align:middle line:10%
as the veil of our collective
consciousness is thinning--

00:47:48.955 --> 00:47:49.755 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:47:49.755 --> 00:47:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> --It's getting easier.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.612 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm already
seeing that, you know,

00:47:54.612 --> 00:47:56.660 align:middle line:90%
people are coming to me more.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
The Circle is being invited
right to get out there more.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Reality is showing me that it is
ready for the particular stream

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of information that
we're bringing through.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.638 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, because reality
is drawing us rather than--

00:48:13.638 --> 00:48:15.180 align:middle line:10%
earlier, I used to
really just trying

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.763 align:middle line:10%
to insert us into reality.

00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is the fan we
were talking about earlier

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:10%
in the podcast.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, frequency activate now.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So that-- that happens first.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.006 align:middle line:90%
Or it's almost simultaneously.

00:48:26.006 --> 00:48:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The fan-- I think the fan
concept they're giving is

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.105 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling really
drawn to something--

00:48:30.105 --> 00:48:30.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:30.905 --> 00:48:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --And we're like, fans,
like fans of a rock star,

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.707 align:middle line:90%
fans of what--

00:48:34.707 --> 00:48:35.915 align:middle line:90%
you drawn to the frequencies.

00:48:35.915 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're drawn to the
opportunity to integrate them.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So, yeah.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.150 align:middle line:90%
If you're a fan of Jesus--

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Frequency activate now
heart-centered consciousness.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But forget about all
the stories, right?

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I have, for
me, in my work as an actor

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and in video game
stuff, I have many fans

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.200 align:middle line:90%
who are drawn to that work.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.492 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're drawn to-- yeah.

00:48:56.492 --> 00:48:57.450 align:middle line:90%
But they drawn to you.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a little, you know--

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Frequency activation.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, those fans
may not want to hear that.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> But, yes.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, their minds
initially may be resistant.

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.352 align:middle line:84%
>> But they-- I don't
think-- you know--

00:49:10.352 --> 00:49:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of them
actually are very--

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all getting matched up.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Like, when I saw Abraham--

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, we were into it, right?

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea that that was
probably a frequency activation

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:84%
now for me that played out I
don't know how much longer it

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.180 align:middle line:90%
was, like a year or two later.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long it was
after meeting with Abraham

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that I had my event.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the mind is
resistant to this information.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it
is, because it's--

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:84%
this information is
here to change the mind.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, no way.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So the initial thing, and
this is what a lot of people

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
in my show is
about, the podcast,

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.130 align:middle line:84%
"Coming Out of the
Cosmic Closet,"

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:84%
as a human being and as
a person with feelings,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I
put myself out there,

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.200 align:middle line:90%
people are going to resist me.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And to my human self
and to my inner child,

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that can feel like rejection.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And that can hurt, right?

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.707 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really what
was happening at the Comedy

00:50:07.707 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Store, is that the
frequency that I was at

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.660 align:middle line:84%
was very different from
that collective energy.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I went through this
storyline of being attacked

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.920 align:middle line:90%
and kind of pushed out.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.653 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was my--

00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:22.150 align:middle line:90%
and it was hard for Georgia.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But for my consciousness, then
all these things opened up,

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and these things happened.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:31.502 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny when we were
talking about YouTube comments

00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and people like, this is
the work of the devil.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of times, those
people are right in the middle

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.145 align:middle line:84%
of a point where
they're about to crack.

00:50:38.145 --> 00:50:38.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And I saw--

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:44.028 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen that
the most resistant--

00:50:44.028 --> 00:50:46.570 align:middle line:84%
they're fighting so much this
big shift that wants to happen.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:47.403 align:middle line:90%
They're fighting it.

00:50:47.403 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Their survival
system's fighting it.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.508 align:middle line:84%
And then they pop through,
and they get so much expansion

00:50:52.508 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:84%
when they get on the other
side of that illusion.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So people might resist
what you're doing at first,

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but we know two-- two days,
two weeks, three weeks later--

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.677 align:middle line:90%
I've learned how to kind of--

00:51:03.677 --> 00:51:04.591 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:51:04.591 --> 00:51:05.482 align:middle line:90%
--And retreat.

00:51:05.482 --> 00:51:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Because Georgia
doesn't necessarily

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:11.458 align:middle line:84%
want to be in the fight
of the resistance.

00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:12.450 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Throw some magic dust.

00:51:13.638 --> 00:51:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Throw some magic dust.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of the--

00:51:15.696 --> 00:51:16.496 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when
people withdraw--

00:51:16.496 --> 00:51:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and that was something
I had to learn.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Because as an
extroverted person,

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to give it all now.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> But I had to learn--

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And retreat.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Because people do
react against--

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had strong
reactions against me.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen the opposite?

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:32.937 align:middle line:90%
People-- well, I--

00:51:32.937 --> 00:51:35.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe you're
familiar-- are you familiar

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.430 align:middle line:90%
with Dorian Virtue?

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And now she's gone
totally Christian?

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:39.668 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened there?

00:51:39.668 --> 00:51:41.034 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:41.034 --> 00:51:41.956 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:51:41.956 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's her way of being in
a clear channel with something

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that really resonates with her.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know,
because I'm not her.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:52.315 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:51:52.315 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Sure

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And I actually haven't even--

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure she
lost some people,

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and she gained some people,
you know, following.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's
sort of swinging--

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And does it-- it--

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.420 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.425 align:middle line:84%
That-- she-- she
definitely was like, nope.

00:52:04.425 --> 00:52:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are
other people who've

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:84%
done, like, the kind of work
that I've done, and gone, nope.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.835 align:middle line:84%
You know, it is
the work the devil.

00:52:10.835 --> 00:52:11.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:11.635 --> 00:52:11.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> But I think that's a lot--

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So maybe if I was
going to say anything,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say that could be
a massive form of threshold

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Where something kicked in.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I say it's
very important for channels

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:90%
to keep working on themselves.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Because every time you push
a threshold of consciousness

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're opening your
channel wider, you get this--

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Next wave.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This-- this-- but you get the
wave of, like, I must be crazy.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I must be mad.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe I am doing
the work of the devil.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I-- you know, like--

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, maybe because
the consciousness is getting

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.790 align:middle line:90%
cracked again.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.077 align:middle line:84%
>> So the nervous system
is up, and it's polarizing,

00:52:51.077 --> 00:52:54.040 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, right and
wrong, true or false, right?

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I think if you get
stuck at that level,

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.950 align:middle line:84%
then you could definitely
sideline into, well,

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.450 align:middle line:90%
it must all be evil.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:02.650 align:middle line:90%
It must all be bad.

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:04.930 align:middle line:84%
If I can't make sense
of this reality,

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:09.880 align:middle line:84%
if I can't get through to
the next level of this,

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.520 align:middle line:84%
then my mind has to
go, well, it is bad.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe being somebody who has
also reached a level of success

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.750 align:middle line:84%
where it can then be a challenge
to keep going inward and doing

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:30.010 align:middle line:84%
the inner work that need-- that
has to accompany the capacity

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to keep holding the
vessel more and more open.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Something happened there.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not for me to-- you know.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:36.504 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But I could see
that that would happen.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a rarer case.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've seen people
go the opposite direction.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> This happened a few times.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I know some personal
people, friends of mine,

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:90%
who have also done that.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> But yeah, you're right.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just not ready
to go to the next level.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> My spiritual initiation,
where I was cracked through

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.200 align:middle line:90%
into all consciousness.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling you-- and
I know when I say something

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.900 align:middle line:84%
like, I have felt the
suffering of all humanity,

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It might just sound like a
line that I'm throwing off.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But that was a very intense
spiritual initiation

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that I went through.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And if I did not have
the tools that I have,

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I probably would have
topped myself, honestly.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it was so painful.

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you don't have the
tools to navigate through that

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.420 align:middle line:90%
space, if you--

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.730 align:middle line:84%
because your mind
is getting blasted,

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I totally understand
why even people go,

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:84%
well, yoga's for weirdos,
meditation's for weirdos.

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.340 align:middle line:84%
That mind wanting to keep
you in the known zone,

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:84%
keep you away from
this threshold.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And keep you out of
that uncomfortable space

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that it happens
is really strong.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.990 align:middle line:90%
And I get it.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't-- I'm like,
I totally get it, you know?

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.780 align:middle line:84%
This-- to crack three
levels of consciousness

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.370 align:middle line:84%
can be-- you know,
can be very painful.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's important
to have tools and have crucible

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle line:90%
supporting you, I think.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's your own
practice that you've

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.470 align:middle line:90%
created for yourself.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So but once you get to
the other side, It's awesome,

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.610 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait, wait.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:17.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you-- like this.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It totally rocks.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's so amazing and awesome.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.695 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is like that thing of
walking to the edge of the door

00:55:25.695 --> 00:55:29.030 align:middle line:84%
of the plane and being
like, what am I doing?

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to die if
I jump out of here.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And then something super
awesome that you didn't imagine

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.980 align:middle line:90%
could happen happens.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Where can people find you again?

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So my website is
www.circleevolution.com.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And we have our
podcasts coming out,

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.400 align:middle line:84%
"Coming Out of the
Cosmic Closet," which

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.033 align:middle line:84%
is all about this
process of then

00:55:48.033 --> 00:55:50.075 align:middle line:84%
taking this kind of weird
ability into the world.

00:55:50.075 --> 00:55:50.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, and getting
people's feedback on that.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The Circle of
Light's material is

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.350 align:middle line:90%
truly beautiful and wonderful.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced it.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We've done some
private sessions.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's top notch.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:03.924 align:middle line:90%
>> It's top notch.

00:56:03.924 --> 00:56:04.306 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:04.306 --> 00:56:05.106 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.106 --> 00:56:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It's-- it's the--

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I think, so far,
the highest levels

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.693 align:middle line:84%
we can go in this unwinding
the matrix stuff that--

00:56:12.693 --> 00:56:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, thanks, Reuben.

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --That we've been doing here.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of great
teachers and stuff that go that

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that's the
real focus of the Circle.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very pure.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Reuben.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, looking
forward to skydiving,

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward to our
time with the Circle tomorrow.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the next day.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Whenever that happens.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And thank you.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.497 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Reuben.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone has a special gift.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Mine?

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.565 align:middle line:90%
The Circle of Light.

00:58:20.565 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They speak through
me, and they they're

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.210 align:middle line:84%
here to assist the
planet's evolution

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to a more enlightened space.

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, they
chose me, a raunchy comedian

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.430 align:middle line:90%
to be their vessel.

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I used to be secretive
about my ability,

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.100 align:middle line:84%
but now it's time to come
out of the cosmic closet,

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and you should too.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.290 align:middle line:84%
My name is Georgia Jean, and
these are my crazy stories.
