00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We definitely are
calling in a new paradigm

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:90%
where we want life to be easy.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
We want life to
be full of bliss.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We want to experience a
higher level of ourselves

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
beautiful unfolding that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:90%
feels effortless.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you're
tapping on a door

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
and the door just opens for you.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's not to negate
the importance of pressure

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, we put pressure
on ourself that is unnecessary.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.135 align:middle line:84%
And we want to alleviate
that unnecessary pressure.

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But there is some really
valuable components

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to pressure.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.735 align:middle line:84%
And those valuable
components are your vision.

The Akashic Records,
or the Akashic Record,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
it's all the same thing.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the state
of consciousness

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
where all information, every
detail of our past, present,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
all possible futures
has been stored.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we learn how to
shift our consciousness,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into the
realm of the Akash

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and begin to draw
intelligence from the Akash.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now the best way to
use the Akashic Record

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:90%
is to ask questions.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But as we ask questions,
that's how we extract

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:90%
the most potent information.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The records work by giving
us what we're ready to hear,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
what we're ready to
embody and nothing more.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Here are some
characteristics of the record

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
so that you know
you are actually

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:90%
in the space of the records.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you're
going to feel supported.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
unconditional love.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to feel
in judgment of yourself,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
or in judgment of other people.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you find that you're
not resonating at that state,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the ego
can come back in.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Ego is any part of our self
that does not identify ourselves

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.805 align:middle line:84%
as God, as right directly
connected to source energy.

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%

During this time of
the Galactic timelines,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:10%
when planet Earth
is going through

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:10%
such huge transformations,
there have

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:10%
been many of these souls,
these ascended master

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:10%
souls, who have
agreed to come back

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and to assist during this time.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
When you're incarnated in
the human form, you forget.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the brilliance
and the beauty of how

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing is designed
though because as we choose

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
to reincarnate, we allow
ourselves to undergo

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the forgetting and
then we allow ourselves

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
waking back up,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we are programming the
collective grids here,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline grid that is
under our feet, the Christ

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
grid that exists up

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
in the upper atmosphere.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We are programming
these grids that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
send energy, that
send knowledge, that

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
send intelligence throughout the
entire planet with the ability

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
for more and more people to
wake up to who they truly are,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
whether they've achieved
ascended mastery or not.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello Emily.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We're in your lovely
home, here in Reno.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
talking some Akashic Records.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Akashic Academy is your brand
that you're working with

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:90%
and I'd love to hear your story.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
We've known you for, it seems
like a year now, almost, maybe.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like
right about a year.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We started talking
and you invited me

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to your conference back
in Sedona last fall.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, will you come be
the special celebrity guest?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it was an honor
to be the special--

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of COVID, so we
had an interesting seminar.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And trying to do anything live
at that time was interesting.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away because I've
heard of the Akashic Records.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I've known about
them a little bit.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the way the
work that you did

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and what you brought everybody
through in connecting

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:90%
was super special.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
introduce that modality

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the
Akash to this audience

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because I think it comes up a
lot in the channeling episodes

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The beings that come
through, they reference it.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you're going to see
it more and more because it is

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
a template for us to
understand instant interfacing

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
communication, being able to
get information and download

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
information that is not
tainted by human perspective,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
it comes from the God-mind.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And the internet is the
physical representation

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
of how most humans on
the planet have actually

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
come into contact
with the pattern that

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:90%
is the Akashic Records.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
This is how they're
experiencing it in their lives,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
so our minds are
opening up and we're

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
able to wrap our head
around the concept.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.458 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to see the Akashic

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Records more and more and more.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:10%
This is the start of this
intelligence interfacing

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:10%
with normal people
on an everyday basis.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, I mean,
for those who've never heard

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Akash, it's essentially
the record of everything.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a record of past,
present, all possible futures.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The future exists in
infinite possibility.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's recorded from a perspective
of unconditional love and zero

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:90%
judgment.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So not the same way that
we humans experience,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
because we come into
a plane where we're

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
experiencing contrast,
we're experiencing

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
polarity, which is great.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:90%
We need that to learn.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Yes we're outgrowing
that, I think.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But that's been the
phase of evolution

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that we've experienced
here on the planet.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, as we're outgrowing
that old way of learning

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're tapping into these
higher realms of consciousness,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we can raise our consciousness
so that we can interface with

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
the Akashic Records.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the key.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about raising your
internal vibrational frequency

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
so that you're a harmonic
match, which basically means

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to get
yourself to the point

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:84%
where you love yourself enough
that you don't judge yourself.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
That you can look at your
life through the lens

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.918 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love and
zero judgment, which means

00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at
yourself that way

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and the people that
have hurt you that way.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's where humans
struggle in being able to tap

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But once we do things to
adjust our energy field,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it's really interesting how
when the mind's vibrating

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
at a higher frequency,
it doesn't latch on

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to the same old thought
patterns that it does when

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
we're in a lower frequency.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we raise our
frequency like that

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and we become that
interface, that match-point,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
then the question is, how
does the interaction happen?

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we just
have to be brave enough

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to use our imagination.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Use your imagination to--

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:90%
in what sense?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> To have the interface, the
communication with the records.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So when we go into
the records, we

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
want to use that
space really similarly

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
to how to use the internet.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:10%
You don't just turn the internet
on and be like, oh, oh, oh.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to invite
forward what you want to know.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So we'll use a search
engine like Google.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm sure
you've typed something

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
into Google before.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The more specific you get, the
more specific the answers are.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
If I were to type
in red Corvette,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I would probably have
millions of hits.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
If I typed in, I don't
know much about cars--

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
1967, I don't know,
is a hard topic thing?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But you see, I would
get more specific.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
The records work the same way.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They work by what's known
as invitation only, which

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they only
invite certain people.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is technically
invited into this space.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It means that we must invite
forward the information

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeking.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So basically, that means
you go in and ask questions.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go through
the process of raising

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness and then
you begin to ask the questions,

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
imagination comes in

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and how you're
receiving the answers.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
This is where our psychic
senses become important.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So just like we have
our outward five senses,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
we have inward five
senses and more--

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:90%
we'll focus on just the five--

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that play with us
in our imagination.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a flower in
your mind right now, right?

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's your clairvoyance,
your clear inner vision.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a song playing
in your mind right now, right?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Or birds singing.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
That's your clair-audience
you're clearly hearing.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
We have clair-sentience as well,
which is a clear inner feeling.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And clair-cognizance,
which is a clear knowing.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It can be interesting
and we have

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to understand
our own subtle energy.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.852 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can be difficult.
Was that a flash of a color,

00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
or a picture that went through
my mind, or am I hearing it,

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
or am I feeling it?

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is nuance
that allows us to begin

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:90%
to develop these senses more.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:10%
But it's about allowing these
senses to bring awareness

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:10%
in our imagination and
trusting that if we've

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:10%
done what we need to do to
connect that higher frequency,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:10%
all the human framework
is doing anyway

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:10%
is sending and
receiving messages.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So once you tune in to
that radio frequency

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:84%
where you're sending and
receiving on that plane,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:90%
you can trust--

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
some people don't,
they still doubt--

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
how do I know it's not me?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It sounds a lot like me.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course it does
because it's your higher

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:90%
self coming through.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:10%
But eventually we
learn to trust what's

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:10%
coming in to the imagination.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.872 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people feel blocked.

00:12:17.872 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take them
into the records

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and we'll ask the question be
like, I'm not getting anything.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
call BS on people.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.085 align:middle line:84%
When does the mind
ever shut off?

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And oh, now all of a sudden your
mind is all pristine and quiet

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is not
picking up anything?

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Like, BS.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:84%
You know I normally would
have said the real s-word.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> You can.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's my show, you can
do whatever you want.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So I do.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I call BS on people who say
they're not getting anything.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes we tense
up and our vibration

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:10%
might lower a bit because
we're fearful that we might not

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:10%
be really ready to do this
or we're not doing it right.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:10%
And it takes us just a
certain environment of love

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:10%
and cultivating that.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:10%
It's a relatively new
skill for our society

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:10%
to embrace as a
collective and to create

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:10%
sacred space to cultivate
these gifts and skills.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:90%
But there are places.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it sounds like the more
less judgmental and the more

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
openly open you are,
the more you can access.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is true in
my experience across

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, in general.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
With the Akashic
Records, the amount

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
of information that one can
receive from the records

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
is directly related
to how much they're

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
willing to love themselves.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And you think about opening
up access to all information,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Past, present, all possible
futures, this is powerful.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:90%
This is important technology.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
This is technology
that must not fall

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of
the wrong people.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, can it?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Not anymore.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what's going to say,
because of the higher vibration

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:84%
of the modalities,
you have to be--

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Of that-- that's why I say--

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people
won't even see it.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.845 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of off the radar.

00:14:11.845 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The lower vibration
people, they won't--

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:90%
akashi what?

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Acai berry, what?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a certain amount
of cloaking naturally that

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:90%
happens with this.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Here's the story according
to what I've downloaded

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:90%
from the Akashic Records.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The story of the Akash?

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of when the Akash
was physically removed from

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was--

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:10%
>> So at the time of
Atlantis and Lemuria,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:10%
the Akashic Records existed
in physical form here

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.448 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you describe that?

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
What is that-- how does
that work, physically?

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Before when they first
started telling me that,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:10%
I thought OK, there must
have been like some mainframe

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:10%
center, or whatever,
and they go in.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just was
comfortable allowing

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that to be my understanding of
what the Akashic Records were

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
when they were
here on the planet.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
What I understand now is they're
left behind in the crystals.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So the crystals are
actually record keepers.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The physical form of the
Akash was stored in crystals?

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the good old days.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:10%
This golden age of
Atlantis and Lemuria,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:10%
where the civilization as a
collective was very psychic.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:10%
They all had their self-healing
skills and gifts turned on.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:10%
The society is
incredibly abundant.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:10%
A collaborative space, rather
than a competitive space.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So what they were
building and creating

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
looks a lot different than what
we're experiencing right now.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.345 align:middle line:10%
>> They didn't have
iPhones or gadgets--

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:10%
>> They had crystals.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I mean, it was
more of, the technology was

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:90%
in a sort of different form.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Like we think of technology,
we think of gadgets and things

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very cultivated, yeah.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I'd say it was more raw.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It is in a raw form
where now we've got--

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
we've moved our technology
into a very cultivated form.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe we should pull
it back to more of a raw form

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
because it feels
like we've reached

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
the point of diminishing returns
with what our technology,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:90%
like the--

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mining.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And taking s to create
these technologies that harm

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:90%
the environment.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They may give us cool
things so we can communicate

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
but hopefully we

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
can get back on that
crystalline track.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, wow, I just got a
whole download coming in.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I really find
valuable to do and the records

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:90%
is to reverse engineer things.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
What if we just reverse
engineered the technology

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:90%
that we have now?

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So the iPhone going
into the record

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be like, how do I
take this back to its most

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.688 align:middle line:90%
raw form, which is telepathy.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
instantly communicate.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
our iPhone does, is

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
it gives-- it's a
decoding device.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's our decoder so that we
can communicate instantly.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You type in the search words
and you get your information.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
We're able to talk
to each other,

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
send pictures
instantaneously, movies.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:84%
It keeps accelerating
in that direction.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah and back in the day,
this was interconnected just

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.915 align:middle line:84%
through the understanding
of the human wiring.

00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So back to, how did the
records go from being here

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%
to not being here?

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
We lived-- I say we--

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>> We is fine.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we were there in
ancient Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So we lived in this
golden age for millennia.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, ego began
to infiltrate that space.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:10%
With everyone having
access to information,

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:10%
which is truly the most valuable
resource in the entire cosmos,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:10%
its intelligence, its data--

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Information.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Information.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:10%
I personally believe that once
we re-engage our connection

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:10%
to the records, we'll level
hierarchy on this planet

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:10%
because everyone
will have access

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:10%
to the same information,
resources, value.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's sort
of happening now.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing--

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happening.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> We're seeing that with--

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happening.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Decentralization through
cryptocurrencies and just

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
the way--

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
decentralized way is like
the new "in" thing, right?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>> And I believe we've had
to earn our way back to this

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:10%
because what we saw happen
in Atlantis and Lemuria,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:10%
once the ego infiltrated
and this knowledge can be

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:10%
manipulated and used
for personal gain,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:10%
if one has access to it.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what began to happen,
which resulted eventually

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.255 align:middle line:84%
in the sinking of
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Kind of chokes me up.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the records
were physically removed

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
from the planet,
located in what's

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
known as seventh or eighth
dimension space-time,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
just depending on who's relaying
that information through.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But the point is we don't
physically access it

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:90%
the same way we used to.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's through a point
in our consciousness.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It's through raising
our frequency

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:90%
that we are allowed access.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of these other
beings that are already hanging

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
out at those higher dimensions,
they're able to access it all

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:90%
The Akashic Records are--

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes it's a library
of information.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Past, present, all
possible futures,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:84%
which gives us an infinite
amount of things that we

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:90%
can do within the records.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the space of the
records, in terms of beings,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
we have masters, including
ascended masters.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Teachers, which are light beings
who are less and specific,

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
just like our teachers come
and go in our lifetime now.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Our guides, who've
been with us--

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
our spirit guides--
who are with us

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
from the time we incarnate
to the time we leave.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:90%
We have archangels.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:90%
We have our loved ones.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:90%
We have ancestors.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's a
central communication

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
hub because it's going to
translate language into--

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's coming in
sacred geometry form,

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's coming
in light language,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
coming in light codes,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:84%
or whether I'm actually hearing
in channeling from the Galactic

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Federation and it sounds
like words and human words

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:90%
that we know--

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
once one learns to
interface with Akash,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the Akash meets you right
where you are and can translate

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:90%
from any one of these beings.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:10%
So it's also like the
Star Wars cantina,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:10%
where we all just get to go
and hang out together and learn

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:10%
from each other.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:10%
>> And communicate too.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So like you said, it's
a communication point

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
for different civilizations,
different languages,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:90%
different cultures.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can use the
records as like an iPhone.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.768 align:middle line:84%
A universal
translator, in a sense.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
That's with the iPhones
and things are now.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
We're having these
apps that we can

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.027 align:middle line:84%
go anywhere in the planet and
hey, talk into this-- oh OK.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Speaking of the iPhone.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs went into
the Akashic Records

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and downloaded these
templates, just

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
like Albert Einstein,
Nikola Tesla.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence
throughout history

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
as we go into journals
of great geniuses

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and whether they describe
it the same way or not,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing is they're
tapping into universal mind

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
because it is
information and it is

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:90%
a place where we can interface.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're also writing
the Akashic Records

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:90%
in every single moment.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We're writing, we're
shifting, we're rewriting.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
important to, I think,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
have a full perspective of
exactly how we're using this

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
because it's present in
all these different aspects

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of our life.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in dream time, we're
tapping in and connecting.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.507 align:middle line:84%
If you are channel
writing, you're

00:22:15.507 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:90%
tapping in and connecting.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing visualization
and you are dreaming

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting in
touch with your mission

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and why you're
here on the planet,

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:90%
you're rewriting things.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's powerful.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it's taking these
old archetypes, the old stories

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what
resonates with you

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and then, OK, now how do I
tell the story differently,

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
or how can I get a
different angle on it?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
What can I do differently?

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
There's the mistakes I
made before, let's do it

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:90%
this way now.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting-- by
tapping into the Akash,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
it seems you're getting
more perspectives

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
to choose from for your journey,
moving forward, in this reality

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and, I guess, if you want to
jump into some other realities,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.785 align:middle line:90%
you could use it there too.

00:22:58.785 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Wow, what an amazing tool
to have in your back pocket?

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
How did you start
accessing this and when?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into the origin story.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well first
of all, I again,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to invite everybody who
is receiving this and here with

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
us today to begin to see areas
where you might be tapping

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
into the Akash and not actually
know that you're doing it

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
every person is using this,

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:90%
at every moment.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But for me when
it became specific

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and it became mindful
that I was using it,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I was an actress in
Hollywood for 20 years.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:90%
We had that in common.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Although, we never
really crossed paths.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no--

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.172 align:middle line:90%
>> In our Hollywood days.

00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we had to jump ship.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well we expressed and
showed up in a new timeline.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is what I find happens
is, as we grow and evolve,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
our mission is, at
the essence, the same.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm still the same storyteller.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm still the same channeler.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, acting is channeling,
using your body as a vessel.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just expressing through
a higher octave now that I've

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
had this "wake up" experience.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So small town girl
from the Midwest.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm the quintessential story.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:10%
Like talk about story and
looking at the old story

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:10%
archetypes, I'm the
girl from the Midwest

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:10%
that leaves town, high
tails it to Hollywood.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Quits college, leaves everything
behind and spent 20 years

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:84%
in the business, loving
every minute-- eh--

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:90%
loving a lot of minutes of it.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Finding it really
difficult because you come

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
face to face with the deepest,
most raw painful parts of you.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And there a lot
of rejection that

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:90%
was involved in that for me.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of coming
from that small town and be--

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:90%
it chokes me up--

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:90%
being that girl.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I felt my community
behind me, but I also

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
felt like I had to
show up for them.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I took on probably more
than Emily actually needed to.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to learn
how to manage that energy.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I grew up immersed
in the church, Southern Baptist

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
church, all up in the Sunday
morning, Sunday night.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Singing.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Singing, and rebelling too.

00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to paint--

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.833 align:middle line:90%
I want to paint a clear picture.

00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I was also sneaking
out of my house.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.063 align:middle line:90%
>> You were one of those--

00:25:26.063 --> 00:25:28.805 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as I was back in time
for church the next morning,

00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
we're good, right?

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So always had something that
came alive in me when I was

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
in that space of spirit.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Didn't necessarily
follow me to Hollywood.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I needed another form of
connecting with that spirit,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:90%
that God energy.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
found meditation,

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
which really began to give
me the tools to manage

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
my own internal energy.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I would stay confident,
I wouldn't be so nervous.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I started just nailing
auditions right and left.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know,
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So I kept doing
it, more and more.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Morning and night.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a Wayne Dyer
meditation that I did.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:10%
I remember the exact
little spot in my house

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:10%
because I found the center
of my house, which was

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:10%
like right outside of the bat--

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:10%
I call it a house.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
In Los Angeles, it was like
a teeny, tiny little space,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm crammed up
against the bathroom door

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.453 align:middle line:84%
and there's a linen
closet behind me.

00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, all jammed
in this little corner

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
middle of the house.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And I did this
powerful om meditation.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:90%
It was an "om" and a "ah".

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning, at 6:00 AM,
I would do 20 minutes of, "ah",

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
seeing the energy
move through my body

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%
out through my third eye.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And then that was the creation.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.775 align:middle line:84%
And then the 6:00 in the evening
was the gratitude, the "ohm".

00:26:56.775 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would do the same
thing, sending it out

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.603 align:middle line:90%
through my third eye.

00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:02.415 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.415 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Getting auditions
right and left.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.957 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can't stop doing
that meditation, right?

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And as you--

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, not auditions, jobs.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Jobs, right.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Auditions are plenty.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the job that
you need to get.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And for every one job,
as you know, there's--

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:10%
for every one, yes,
there are hundreds

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:10%
of no's that go along with that.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So this meditation became
a crucial staple for me.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
meditate, the more

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:84%
you dedicate that time to
going inward and creating space

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:90%
to meet yourself, the true you.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:90%
And let that expand.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but
to reinvent yourself

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in a higher frequency
of consciousness.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And I naturally began to
have a drive, a desire

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:10%
to want to just work
on people, help people.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a neighbor
that lived in my community

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
who I just knew from walking
through the neighborhood.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't seen
him for a long time.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And then there, he's walking
through the neighborhood,

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
again, but limping.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked what happened.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, he had
broken his ankle.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't healing well.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
said this next part,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure that it was Emily.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come over
for some energy healing?

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wait a second.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an energy
healer, I'm an actress.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.195 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, like,
who said that?

00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And then he said yes.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So he came over.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And again, I was winging it.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I had no formal
training, no skills,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
but I did have a tuning fork.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Just waving it around.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And then into my
awareness-- my imagination--

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:90%
a being came.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who this
being was, so I asked.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
He said that it was his
father, my friend's father.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I began the telepathic
conversation in my mind.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.502 align:middle line:84%
And just playfully
having the conversation.

00:28:49.502 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't speaking any
of it to my friend.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
My friend had his
solfeggio scale,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
headphones on, he had his eyes
closed, his foot propped up.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm just waving-- I'm winging
it-- waving the tuning fork

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.208 align:middle line:90%
wherever.

00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> But you started this--

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But I started the
conversation with his father.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And then after--

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> How'd that go?

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
What'd you guys talk about?

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really playful
in the beginning.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I asked him what his name
was, which I was scared

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and I know better
than that because it's

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
hard to get an exact-- well,
it's hard until it's not.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.455 align:middle line:90%
Let me not create that story.

00:29:19.455 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, like
hell, you're going

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:90%
to get his name right, Emily.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's the same 19-year-old
from the Midwest that quit life

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
as I knew it and made a bold
decision to come to Hollywood.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It's that same bold
play-- screw it.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask your name.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And he told me Bob, Bob, Bob.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But not Bob, it's
a J name, but Bob.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me give you just a
little aside there, and pause.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So when beings from
other dimensions

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
are interfacing with
me, or anyone else,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
they are going to speak
in context or framework

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:90%
that being--

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
me in this case--
would understand.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And my father in
law's name was Bob.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So I had a framework of being
able to understand that easily.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So Bob, Bob, Bob, but not
Bob, but a "J" name, but Bob.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
I asked him-- oh--

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
he actually, Bob, but
not Bob, but "J" name,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
volunteered this information
that he said please let my son

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
know that I was there and
I saved him when he fell.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
did a shitty job.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:90%
His ankle is shattered.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> He's barely walking.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But the father still said,
no, he claimed that space.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably would
have been much worse.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Ruben, I'm going to circle
back to all of these pieces.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, sorry.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the third piece
that I really remember

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:90%
was he showed me his hands.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So then I began-- the session
was over, Daniel went home.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mention any of it.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to pee, I went
to the bathroom.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm washing my
hands and it's just

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
like, he's not
leaving, the father.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, go let him know that
I was here, that I was here.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So I reached out to my
friend, I said, listen,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.288 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider
myself a medium.

00:31:33.288 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Reached out to Daniel.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Reach out to Daniel.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider myself a
medium, but this came through.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Would you like the information?

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.358 align:middle line:90%
So we met and sat down again.

00:31:44.358 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, all right,
well the first thing

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I did was ask his name.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:90%
So what was your dad's name?

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my
dad's name was Alan.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, I
got that one wrong.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:90%
I was getting like a "J" name.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Bob, Bob, Bob, but
the "J" name, but Bob.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Daniel's
face went white,

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:84%
he said, my father's
name was Alan Jay.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:90%
J-A-Y, he went by Jay.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I thought, OK.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:90%
We must be on to something here.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> But who's Bob?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he was getting me,
the Bob because I would have

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:90%
a reference point for Bob.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then he was telling me, but
it's not Bob, it's a J name,

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:90%
but a short name like Bob.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Three letters, B-O-B.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see, I see.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how it ended
up clicking for me.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I gotcha.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.105 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes we have to work
to put the pieces together just

00:32:31.105 --> 00:32:33.520 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're talking,
communicating from intermittent

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:84%
dimensional realms, it
gets-- there can be static

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.320 align:middle line:90%
in the lines sometimes.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:90%
You gotta listen carefully.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.985 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes verb conjugation
gets a little funky.

00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it's like, when you're
trying to talk to somebody

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.443 align:middle line:84%
on the cell phone and their
bad reception is like,

00:32:51.443 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
you get pieces and
you're like, OK,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
do I want to make them repeat
the whole thing over again

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or do I just take what I got
and then fill in the pieces?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think I got
enough to get the gist.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, exactly.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:10%
>> So then we went on to
Alan Jay saying that he saved

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:10%
Daniel.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, your dad
said that he saved you.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I told him that
he did a shitty job.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And sorry, but I think he did.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel goes no,
this is what happened.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
He was on the second floor
of an outdoor mall space.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So that it was
outdoor shopping, it

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.450 align:middle line:84%
wasn't like he was inside
on the second floor.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Outside on the balcony.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And he began to feel dizzy.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he had left the
store and gone out to get air.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was standing
there, concrete stairs,

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:84%
lost consciousness, got
dizzy, passed out and fell.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And when the paramedics
got him, they said,

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
it was one of those
literally like one inch

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and you would have fallen down
two flights of concrete stairs

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and probably not be here.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we got to the
last piece of this story,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.839 align:middle line:84%
where I shared with Daniel that
his father had shown me hands.

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:10%
It's crazy-- it just
takes me back instantly.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's when Daniel
basically had the same reaction

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm having for you now.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, this guy comes to visit.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:90%
He's OK?

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You feel it?

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel the emotion
coming up, baby?

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
So Daniel had a similar
reaction, a flood

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.060 align:middle line:90%
of emotion came over him.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with me that he
was holding his father's hand

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:90%
when his father passed.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And they had been estranged
for quite some time,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:90%
up until that point.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel had felt
sad that he didn't

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity with his
dad that he may have wanted.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
That was their reconciliation
point, when he passed.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And this opened up a completely
new possibility for Daniel

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to have that connection
with his father.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I experienced that
feeling, not only firsthand,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:84%
witnessing that of my friend,
but being the vessel that

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
could facilitate
something like that,

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:84%
there's not a lot that's
better than Hollywood.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It takes something pretty
mystical and magical.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that when you started
to distance yourself from

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:84%
your other work and
go more into that?

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:90%
How long ago was that?

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's, see when was that?

00:35:33.115 --> 00:35:35.040 align:middle line:90%
That was 2015.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, almost instantly
it was, yeah, screw this.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to let people know that
they can turn on their skills.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
I was born psychic,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but there was no doubt in
my mind, at that point,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had cultivated a
sharpness and acuteness

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.880 align:middle line:84%
with being able to
perceive inter-dimensional

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%
that had come from meditation.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing special.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And that people
needed to know this.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It felt-- I felt more alive.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:90%
I felt more magic.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And truly, that's what
we're chasing in Hollywood.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Is we're using the human body
to emote the story of whatever

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.400 align:middle line:90%
the story is, humanity.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And this was just such a
more powerful way for me

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.335 align:middle line:90%
to experience all of that.

00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a no brainer
at that point.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So 2015 is pretty recent.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're sort of
getting activated here,

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:90%
in a recent sense.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And then how long after that
before you made this move

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to Reno, you
started connecting--

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:90%
you started doing your work?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> About 10 minutes after
that experience with Daniel,

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I was enrolled in an Akashic
Records certification program.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I knew I wanted
to hang a sign on my door

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and teach people something.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
didn't know what it was.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew, for me, it wasn't
Reiki, it wasn't yoga,

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.040 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't exactly know.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I had grabbed a Conscious
Life magazine the last time

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.155 align:middle line:90%
I was in an audition.

00:37:12.155 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Just like picked it up and
I'm like, where is that thing?

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I ran and I went and dug
it out of my audition bag.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And I started
flipping through it,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:84%
like as fast as I could
flip through those pages

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and I got to the back where
they had like old school ads,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:90%
like newspaper ads.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found a couple
certifications.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm flipping through
and I'm like,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Akashic records--
boom-- that's it.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
My mom had gifted me a
session, maybe 10 years prior.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Just as a Christmas present.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I use
the time to ask, when

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:90%
is my career going to break?

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
What about that role
in Transformers?

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:90%
What about that role in--

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't even remember
what the big Marvel

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.230 align:middle line:84%
movie was that I missed
by the skin of my teeth--

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.390 align:middle line:90%
it's huge.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:90%
What's the one with Wolverine?

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait you worked on,
or you were going to work

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:90%
on Transformers? what

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I auditioned for
all of those big films.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, this is so stupid.

00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Fantastic Four, or
something like that?

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.393 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing
you weren't in that.

00:38:09.393 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a terrible movie.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this Akashic
Record reading,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm like digging into what's
going to happen in my career.

00:38:17.935 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And didn't realize that it
was actually activating me.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I just got it in this
moment for what was

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to my career.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're-- yeah.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.767 align:middle line:84%
You asked about your
career and here you

00:38:34.767 --> 00:38:36.020 align:middle line:90%
are, doing Akashic readings.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And here I am.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But truly, the power is learning
how to do this for oneself.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So I teach people how to
interface in their records.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them,
I share with them

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the unique way of
accessing the records

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:90%
that my guides gifted to me.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lineage
that's been passed down.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And I teach people how to get
the most out of this space.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I hold the field while
they learn how to do that.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And I can read for you too.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's better if you do
it because this is your soul

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:90%
records.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want it
coming through Bob, Bob,

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:90%
not Bob, but Jay?

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that's my that's
my interpretation of life.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:90%
This is about yours.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the framework
that I put it in.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records is
the cosmic field guide

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:90%
for being here.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.465 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to teach you
how to drive, teach you

00:39:38.465 --> 00:39:40.840 align:middle line:84%
how to go into this realm and
all of the different things

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Then I hand you
the keys and say,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
go drive around the cosmos
now Ruben and have some fun.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Play with the records and
do what feels alive for you

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:90%
in the record.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So my goal is to
reestablish a connection

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and remembrance to this field
that everyone has access to.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Teach them how to use it
to its highest and most

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
potent potential because
there's a lot of genius that can

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:90%
be extracted from this space.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And then bless them
on the mission.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.180 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a very
self-empowering tool.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's designed to
be, in my opinion,

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the most potent self
transformational tool

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.940 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Well just imagine
being able to have God

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
perspective, goddess
perspective on everything

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
that confuses us in life.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a game changer.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, definitely
all the options of--

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.150 align:middle line:84%
potential options
available to you

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:84%
are made instantaneously so
you're not limiting yourself

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to a specific story,
a specific choice.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You realize when you get
to that higher perspective

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have way more
options than we think

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:20.080 align:middle line:84%
or we've been told that we
have for everything in life.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> For every one challenge,
there are an infinite number

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:90%
of solutions.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And most people-- not
most people, many people--

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Good one.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You just like-- you just
connected with the field

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.058 align:middle line:84%
You imprinted the records
and we all shot up

00:41:38.058 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:90%
a level of consciousness.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Well because now, it used to
be most people, now it's many.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Many people are hanging
on to the old stories.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> A few of you dumb asses
are still hanging on to those

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I just up leveled us again.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a few.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.577 align:middle line:84%
>> You're welcome,
you're welcome.

00:41:55.577 --> 00:41:57.685 align:middle line:84%
>> We went from most,
to many, to just a few.

00:41:57.685 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> A few of you out there are
hanging on to the old stories.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And not seeing through
the forest, so to say.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And are making decisions
based on just a limited view

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.253 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:42:17.253 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The guides are popping in
right now into and wanting me

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:90%
to explain this.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.993 align:middle line:84%
They did a few beats
ago and I said,

00:42:21.993 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:84%
no we're going in a
different direction.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.118 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
back with it again.

00:42:25.118 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:10%
So they would like me to explain
how infinite possibility works.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we say we have
infinite possibilities, right?

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> What we just did when we went
from many to-- what did we do?

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.290 align:middle line:90%
We went many, to--

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Most.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> To few.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Or most, to many, to few.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Most, to many, to few.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what we did.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Similarly, when it comes
to infinite possibility,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:84%
how does the possibility or
the timeline that you want get

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the one you experience
if they're infinite?

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you asked.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's a vibrational coherence.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So we moved from the state
of infinite possibility.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be like
the farthest ring

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
out, if we were looking at
it as like rings of energy.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The more we give our
attention, our focus,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
our feelings, the more
we think about something,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that particular vibrational
frequency increases.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The timeline, the
possibility that

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
contains that frequency
match, so you can use it

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:84%
for stressing about your bills
or you can use it of picturing

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:90%
yourself in Costa Rica.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I've done both.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It works on both it.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It's really fantastic.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So the infinite
possibility, as we

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:84%
begin to pick which
one of those we want,

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we don't
pick with mindfulness

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.400 align:middle line:84%
or with consciousness,
we pick by default

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:90%
or we pick unconsciously.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.630 align:middle line:90%
But everybody gets a pick.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So once you pick and you
begin to feel the feelings,

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
think about what's
going on that's

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in vibrational coherence
with that timeline,

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:90%
you're strengthening it.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's moving from an
infinite possibility

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to it got a little
bit stronger so now it

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:90%
becomes a probability.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the more we
give it that energy,

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the probability moves closer
until we experience manifest

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:90%
as physical reality.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I love that.

00:44:18.492 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You used the word also
earlier, reverse engineer.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And in my own sort of
figuring things out,

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that's been key to
seeing the highest

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
probable potential reality of
an outcome from any situation.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing it, but
then reverse engineering

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:90%
how to get there.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Because most, many-- few of us
will see just the next step.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And then really not
even have that vision

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.860 align:middle line:84%
of what is the highest
possible outcome

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:84%
because it may seem
so far from what's

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle line:90%
probable in the sense of--

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Or what we've
experienced before.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>What we've
experienced, or what

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:90%
our idea of is probabilities.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:84%
That's no way, but when you
actually think of that first

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and then you reverse
engineer from that point,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.835 align:middle line:84%
you can actually start
to connect the dots.

00:45:14.835 --> 00:45:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:90%
But you have to see it first.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't see it, then
it's not even in your field.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So now you're going with
the second hand, or not

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:90%
the optimal probability.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, unconscious.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Unconscious.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Probability.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.008 align:middle line:90%
>> (IN UNISON) Default.

00:45:35.008 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, jinx, you owe me a soda.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Soda?

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Bubbly water.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Coffee?

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Coffee.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Coffee.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We can do coffee.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.150 align:middle line:90%
So very cool.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And that idea of reverse
engineering, I love that.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly-- OK.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this makes me so excited.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
This is what I realized
about my specific blueprint.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I told you the story.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I quintessential, can't
be more storybook.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Small town farmer Midwest
girl, quits college

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and hightails it to Hollywood
to find her fame and fortune.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I help people find what their
highest dream timeline is.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I can see it in
the field for them.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I have a gift of
vision and being

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.290 align:middle line:84%
able to see someone's
highest potential

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and to hold that
frequency for them.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you reverse engineer
it through the records.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so fun.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And you get to meet some of
those people who are doing

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:90%
that with me, like in Sedona.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It was fun watching their
journey and watching them

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.040 align:middle line:84%
access the records and you
walking through them and seeing

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.840 align:middle line:90%
how it worked.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I, again, I had an
idea of what the Akash was.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand it.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And you helped clarify how
accessing these records

00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and us tapping into it
can self empower us,

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.160 align:middle line:84%
it can move us into
the highest potential.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Level hierarchy.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, level hierarchy
is a big part of it.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have to rely
on others to do it for us.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.350 align:middle line:90%
We can do it ourselves.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is the theme
of my show, right?

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So it just seems
for the past six,

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:84%
seven years I've been on
this journey, every bit of it

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.100 align:middle line:90%
has been about that.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're
all super-humans.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We all have access to these
superhero-type abilities.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- as the planet
is making this great shift--

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:84%
we are getting activated,
whether we like it or not.

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's impossible to escape it
because it actually has to do

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.200 align:middle line:90%
with Galactic positioning.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, where our solar system
is flying through the galaxy

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:10%
right now, the Mayans
had this charted.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They knew that we were
going to be in alignment

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.300 align:middle line:84%
with Galactic center during
this time, as we entered

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.710 align:middle line:90%
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So every single one of
us are being bombarded

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.400 align:middle line:90%
by these photons of light.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about, photons
of light store and transfer

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:12.870 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Just like everything is energy.

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And sound is a particular
vibrational frequency of energy

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that stores and transfers
knowledge and information.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Photons of light
do the same thing.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're experiencing just
being completely bombarded

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.890 align:middle line:84%
by that, simply from our
alignment in the galaxies.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:35.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're on planet Earth,
you can't get away from it.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is waking up as these
light codes are coming in.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:44.010 align:middle line:84%
When these photons of light
interact with our DNA,

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.870 align:middle line:84%
they begin to wake
up our dormant DNA.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.260 align:middle line:90%
So we have 12 strands of DNA.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And scientists
understand two of them.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the other
10 strands, they refer to

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:84%
as junk DNA, are
actually our connection

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum world.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They have direct correlation to
our psychic senses, as our DNA,

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.460 align:middle line:84%
those get turned on, our
psychic senses get turned on.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:15.870 align:middle line:84%
My personal theory is, the
second coming of Yeshua,

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, happens
when each one of us

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.010 align:middle line:84%
have all 12 strands
of our DNA come alive

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and what Jesus said, the
least amongst you can do all

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that I have done, and
more becomes true.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And not only was he performing
miracles like walking

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:middle line:84%
on the water and multiplying the
loaves, like the manifesting--

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that time he raised Lazarus
from the dead, you know,

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.490 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Not only were we seeing--

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:48.810 align:middle line:84%
will we start seeing more of
these quantum-type experiences

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that were unexplainable before,
but the most powerful skill

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and DNA that he had
turned on that will get us

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:90%
there is compassion.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah and forgiveness.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Forgiveness.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Together.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.653 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
talk about crystals.

00:50:07.653 --> 00:50:09.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a couple of
crystal skulls here.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> How about that?

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We have a bigger crystal
skull in the back room

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.528 align:middle line:90%
that we'll pull out in a minute.

00:50:15.528 --> 00:50:16.820 align:middle line:90%
You're probably getting zapped.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
How did you sleep last
night, by the way?

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Did you sleep?

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I had downloads all night long.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Lost them this morning.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Not lost them, there
plugged in, but it's

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:84%
like they evaporated
very quickly.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
They were like glimpsing--
allowing me to glimpse them.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I will share that there
is a part of me yesterday

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.970 align:middle line:84%
in preparing for
you guys to come,

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:90%
there was a sacred awareness.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And just for our audience,
we're working on another

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:10%
project with the
Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.900 align:middle line:10%
We've been taking it around,
doing some amazing stuff.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:59.220 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, just so
happens to be, we're

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.700 align:middle line:10%
traveling with the Bill and the
Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.250 align:middle line:10%
And we showed up at
your house last night.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It just so happens
to be in my guest room.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to be doing
some of that work later.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But mentioning the
skulls, I wanted

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to go back to this
idea of the photon belt

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and the light codes
being activated.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It seems that from--

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.590 align:middle line:90%
the skull is also able to--

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.990 align:middle line:84%
these crystals are
being activated too.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they're like how
we use our cell tower.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> My ears are going off as
you're talking in this moment.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The cell tower to--

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.170 align:middle line:90%
a signal will take it and then--

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.690 align:middle line:84%
especially if you like
ham radio operators,

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:90%
you have these repeaters.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:59.417 align:middle line:84%
And the signal can get-- as long
as it can get to the repeater,

00:51:59.417 --> 00:52:01.500 align:middle line:84%
then it'll jump and it'll
get to the next repeater

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and it'll continue.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And the way I'm understanding
how this is unfolding

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.440 align:middle line:90%
is that the skulls and other--

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.780 align:middle line:84%
crystal, the ones you
found in your Lemurian--

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Lemurian crystal
out here and others.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.790 align:middle line:84%
They're all getting activated
by the photon stuff, as well.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So not only are we
individually, but these crystals

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that have been holding this
energy for so long that

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:28.200 align:middle line:84%
have been dormant, are now
getting activated and as

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:84%
an extra boost of energy
that we can absorb and take

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.810 align:middle line:90%
in and get activated--

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'm getting right now
is that when you were talking

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:84%
about you pass it
on to the next,

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that is a key component that's
being turned on right now.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.440 align:middle line:84%
For quite some
time, an individual

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:84%
who wants to activate has
the ability and the framework

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:90%
and the construct to do that.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.970 align:middle line:10%
But now we're turning
on like this rapid fire

00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:00.330 align:middle line:10%
of like the domino
effect, going down.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Where the interface
can't be stopped.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I've seen it too.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's probably why
we're seeing on our planet

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:16.800 align:middle line:10%
right now, so much
repression and suppression

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to
these other forces.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.933 align:middle line:84%
Because these dominoes
are following so fast

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:23.850 align:middle line:90%
it's like, oh, my God.

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting your
finger in the dam and then

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.040 align:middle line:84%
another one, and then
another one, and another one.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
crazy stuff happen

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:84%
with government and politics
and medical world and all

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that stuff because
the dam is breaking.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
panic mode for some

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of those guys because
of some of the stuff

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying
to implement.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it seems the more
they implement it,

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:90%
the more the dam is breaking.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of working--

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.288 align:middle line:90%
It's structurally compromised.

00:53:59.288 --> 00:54:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Great way to say that.

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, structurally compromised.

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That was them.

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:84%
The old structure is
definitely compromised.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's falling apart.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They wanted to just bring
some awareness into how you

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and I specifically
are playing roles.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.780 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>> We got cast in the roles.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:84%
How we're playing roles that
are helping with the knocking

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.940 align:middle line:90%
down of the dominoes.

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'll speak for myself.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Before, two entities
might have stood

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:36.780 align:middle line:84%
in their own platform, their
own energy, their own fame,

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:90%
their own impact--

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.340 align:middle line:90%
whatever word you want to use--

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:45.720 align:middle line:84%
without being so open to
collaboration, or maybe

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
a little standoffish
until you prove yourself.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.347 align:middle line:84%
Right, right,
right, right, right.

00:54:50.347 --> 00:54:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And there was none of that.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It was just instantaneously,
oh, yes, I remember you.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:55.750 align:middle line:90%
There's work to do.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Just how our skulls are doing
that right now here together

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.580 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
interface-- or this

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.990 align:middle line:84%
is what the template of this
new level of knocking down

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.460 align:middle line:90%
the dominoes looks like.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it in--

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:84%
you gave that metaphoric
framework of the dominoes.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But then it looks like
something in real life.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it looks like.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It looks like being able
to find those high level

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.080 align:middle line:84%
connections of people who've
cultivated their consciousness.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, we're picking
up right where we left off,

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:33.980 align:middle line:10%
wherever the mission
paused before.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.970 align:middle line:10%
We're un-pausing.

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening with a lot
of different people like that.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.860 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
people who are stepping

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:50.900 align:middle line:10%
into this new operating system
of we don't have to prove--

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:10%
we don't have to prove
who we are and what we do,

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:55.880 align:middle line:10%
and what we can do.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.130 align:middle line:90%
It's recognizing it.

00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Or we just do.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I mean.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just
doing it, we don't

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.340 align:middle line:84%
have to spend time proving
that we're doing it.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Just do it and then
those who are aware

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:10%
and those who are
also just doing it,

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.680 align:middle line:10%
we get to skip that layer--

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.300 align:middle line:10%
that proving layer.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Which in the past, because I
guess there was a lot of BS

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:24.800 align:middle line:84%
out there, you had
to sort through it.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes sense.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, of course, we
had-- that's what like--

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that's where the idea of
charlatans come in and snake

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.230 align:middle line:90%
oil.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And just like we had the ET
disclosure and things coming

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.440 align:middle line:84%
in right now, even some of
the pieces that we feel like

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.275 align:middle line:84%
are disclosure, still slightly
tweaked and distorted.

00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And we know that though.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so we're going
through this same process

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:55.470 align:middle line:90%
as we're waking up.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom keepers
are coming forward.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom keepers,
mystics, previously

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:09.360 align:middle line:84%
have existed in China,
up in the mountains.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.415 align:middle line:84%
Not just China, lots
of places across the--

00:57:12.415 --> 00:57:14.070 align:middle line:84%
they're not just in
China, everybody.

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:17.640 align:middle line:90%
But they are removed.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Not immersed in the
trenches in modern day

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:21.480 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of society.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They sit at this
different space where

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.817 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the same
issues that they have to do.

00:57:27.817 --> 00:57:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They just get to sit up here
and meditate and then bring

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.990 align:middle line:90%
the energy in.

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the oracles
of the mystics,

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:39.780 align:middle line:84%
the wise people
that we would go to.

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were kind of
removed from society.

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't
look like that now.

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The new template
because you know why?

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.830 align:middle line:10%
It only works so
well, what we need.

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm finding is, the
avatar of the ascended master

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:58.110 align:middle line:84%
is waking up in the
moment, complete forgetting

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:01.560 align:middle line:84%
of who you are and then you
experience it and you share

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:90%
as you experience.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:07.410 align:middle line:84%
For me, that just looks like
bringing a really high level

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of vulnerability to the
challenges that I have,

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:13.470 align:middle line:84%
as I'm walking
through this process.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Showing all of the behind the
scenes of what does it look

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.550 align:middle line:84%
like to be a real human,
having this experience.

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And the challenges are, we need
to learn how to course correct.

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:28.050 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked about
that the other day

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is that people don't have a
framework of how to do a 180.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Belief is something that
I believe will mess us up.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because belief in and of
itself creates polarity.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to choose
one side or the other.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So for me, what's worked better
is I just say believe nothing,

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.740 align:middle line:90%
consider everything, Emily.

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And that moves me
back into a more state

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:52.080 align:middle line:84%
of unity consciousness,
where I'm not

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.960 align:middle line:90%
picking one side or the other.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But course correction
is incredibly important

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:02.040 align:middle line:84%
because we create
and we mis-create.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And what our society needs
templates for right now

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:84%
is space, compassion and
methodology on how to course

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.850 align:middle line:90%
correct.

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're constantly
shifting and changing

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and telling a new story,
but so many people,

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.980 align:middle line:84%
they get glued and attached
to a specific story,

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.920 align:middle line:84%
which creates an identity
and then they get attached

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to the identity because
that's how people know them.

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.425 align:middle line:84%
That's how people
relate with them.

00:59:31.425 --> 00:59:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how they
know themselves.

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how they
know themselves.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So in the identity, if
it's part of a collapsing

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:44.580 align:middle line:84%
system or a modality
that's not really

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.330 align:middle line:84%
serving the individual or the
collective in a healthy way,

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:52.800 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
collapse with the attachment

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.145 align:middle line:90%
to these other things.

00:59:54.145 --> 00:59:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what we're
seeing right now in society

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:03.420 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of people who had been
attached to a specific story

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:12.850 align:middle line:84%
before are fighting and
resisting the shift of well,

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:15.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe, I need a new identity, or
maybe I don't need an identity.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can just
flow and ebb and flow

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
with what's being presented
with me right now.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have to attach
myself to this thing?

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Being vulnerable, being
able to shift the story.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:34.115 align:middle line:84%
Being able to be in the moment
and not have the attachment,

01:00:34.115 --> 01:00:36.190 align:middle line:90%
this is what we're doing here.

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
This new lifestyle is
not judging somebody

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
for who they were or who they
are or who they want to be,

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
it's just like you're
you, and that's OK.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm me and that's OK.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think realizing
that we're all pioneers.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And we are on the forefront
of a landscape that's

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:58.910 align:middle line:84%
changing so rapidly, we've
never experienced this before.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:01.120 align:middle line:90%
So we're learning as we go.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And we need to remember and
have that level of compassion

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
for each other because we're all
reinventing in the now moment.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
We're all playing improv
actor with each other.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.705 align:middle line:84%
And there's a rawness
to that journey that--

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:19.440 align:middle line:90%


01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I think, when we're not
graceful in our growth,

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
there's judgment that happens
I think in just like, oh, God,

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.930 align:middle line:90%
she's a mess or she's just--

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.120 align:middle line:90%
she's a train wreck.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Clean up on aisle four.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to remember that this is
a really sensitive time, where

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.240 align:middle line:90%
it's messy.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.723 align:middle line:84%
The growth doesn't
look as graceful

01:01:41.723 --> 01:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
as you think it
does in your mind.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Just like Hollywood, we have--

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, we have
a certain expectation

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of what it's going to
look like on the inside.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And once you get on the
inside, you realize the smoke

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and mirrors.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah lots of
smoke and mirrors.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think the goal, or what
I feel the goal is, for me,

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and the world that
I want to live in

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
is to take some of the
smoke and mirrors away

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and to be OK with the
dirtiness, the rawness that's

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.130 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of beauty there.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of awesome
stories and richness there.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be so polished.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Look at the grip.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at the camera guy sweating.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But the person
applying the makeup

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
as a huge story of how
they got to that position

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and what they're doing
and all the things.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The stunt guys, that's my
world where I was hanging out

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.957 align:middle line:90%
for many of the years.

01:02:47.957 --> 01:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So glad you're not
jumping off bridges anymore.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, the mom in
me, I can't handle it

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.930 align:middle line:90%
when you do that stuff, Ruben.

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I will still go back from
time to time, but it's not--

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.210 align:middle line:90%
this is way more fun for me now.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.230 align:middle line:90%
That stuff's fun too, but--

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's a lot
of richness there.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding
that documentaries.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
big boom in documentary

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
filmmaking, and just telling
the real raw stories that

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
are already happening on
this planet, as opposed

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
to having to pre-heat up and
do this amazing Tom Cruise,

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
flying through the fire and
the thing and the thing.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.310 align:middle line:90%
There's like that-- we get that.

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%
That's fun.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what that does is
we lose our humanity in that

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.560 align:middle line:90%
because we get desensitized.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
think is happening

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
is there's a sensitivity
that's rising in people.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well we can do some
other work with this goal

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:48.390 align:middle line:90%
in a minute, but any last--

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
any messages from
the Akashic guides

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
on what our little message
to the world is here?

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, the biggest thing
that's coming in right now,

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:03.870 align:middle line:10%
in this moment, has been a piece
that I am excited to share more

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:08.100 align:middle line:10%
with the crew, with skull squad,
as we go into the mountain

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.950 align:middle line:10%
because it's a critical piece
in raising the vibration

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.380 align:middle line:10%
and keeping the
vibrational frequency high.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's Mary Magdalene
who comes forward and asks

01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:18.930 align:middle line:90%
us to just let it go.

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And this will be important for
each of us as we are preparing,

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
but any negative thought,
density, frustration, pain,

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
injustice especially,
she's saying right now,

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.000 align:middle line:90%
we must let it go.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
You must let it go.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You must learn to find
that place within yourself

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
where no one can harm you
and stay in that frequency.

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
So important right now.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, sometimes the attachment
for revenge or justice,

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, revenge is the
severe part, but justice.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Justice and that
attachment to that

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
keeps us tied to that negative--

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Retaliation, as a response,
is symptomatic of lower

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.140 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wow, well said.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, awesome.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So looking forward
to playing some more

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and sharing your story
and doing your work

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and showing others how to
tap into this invisible field

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that's around us all
the time, and still

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
physical in some forms.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a copy
in our DNA too.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So as our DNA turns on,
like we spoke of before,

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll have instantaneous access
within our framework again.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, awesome.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Emily.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Ruben.

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:48.375 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hug.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:52.360 align:middle line:90%


01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:55.105 --> 01:05:55.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Good stuff.

01:05:55.905 --> 01:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you here.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we are.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> In Reno.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.070 align:middle line:90%
