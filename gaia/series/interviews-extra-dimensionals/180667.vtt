[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.491 --> 00:01:23.832 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Nora.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Reuben.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we are.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for doing this
a second time, sort of.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been filming
you on and off here.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.015 align:middle line:90%
So I've asked you this before.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm here, and we've
gotten all the cameras on you.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe to me the
process of what do you do

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
energies do you tap into?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And then hopefully, hopefully
we can tap into them today.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:56.294 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So I do what's called
direct voice channeling.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.962 align:middle line:90%
I also translate.

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So they're two different
versions of channeling work.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Translation is I listen and
receive and then tell you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in my own voice the information
I'm getting and what I hear.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I often do that
when I work privately

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
in one-on-one sessions.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll do some translation work
and I'll use my own voice.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've expressed the
importance of us, all of us,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
accessing information
in a variety of ways.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.048 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the ways
I access information.

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But then I also
direct voice channel.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So direct voice channel means
I raise my personal vibration

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
I can connect up

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
with beings who
exist in a higher

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
dimension, another
vibration, another frequency.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
They interact with me
telepathically, move through me

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I allow them to alter
my vocal chords,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:90%
speak directly through me.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
The beings I work with are
the Pleiadian Collective,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
so they're a 12th dimensional
collective of beings

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that if we were
going to assign them

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
a location in our third
dimensional version

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:90%
of reality--

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 12th dimension.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:90%
How do you even have that--

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's even so far
out of earthly terms, but--

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's different experience,
different flavors.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Along with that comes different
abilities, different awareness.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So when I say 12th dimensional
Pleiadian Collective,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
they are a gigantic
being of love and light

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that knows themselves to be one
and yet understands that they

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%
are comprised of many ones.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
But they do not each
individuate themself

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
like we do here on Earth.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Hence the collective,
the term collective.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not a specific
being in particular.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But there are specific
beings I work with, as well.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians are one
of many groups and beings

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I work with.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
A specific being
would be Calliandra.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:90%
She's a fifth dimensional fairy.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
So we'll call her a fairy.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
That's how she
presented herself to me.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I also work with Yeshua.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I see Yeshua to be
a collective being.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But we know that being to be
an individual entity that we

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:90%
call Jesus on this planet.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know, I know that energy
to be a collective energy.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
The Archangel Michael, at
times, will come through me.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:90%
The Lyrenz, beings from Lemuria.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
The Zetas have made
contact with me.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a very in the
moment process for me.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But the majority
of the information

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm accessing at this time
is coming from the Pleidians,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeshua, Calliandra.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are kind of
the big three for me.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And are you--

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:90%
you're present when--

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> --in your awareness
when this happens.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.793 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
conk out and then

00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
you wake up and like,
oh, what happened?

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I've seen that.

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people
who have channeled

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and that's taken place.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.428 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking about
there is trance channeling.

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Trance channeling, OK.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
What I do is called
conscious channeling

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and/or semi-conscious
channeling.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can even see
a difference in me

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
when I'm fully conscious and
then when I am semi-conscious.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.562 align:middle line:84%
>> So has that happened
to you in the past?

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So the fully
conscious channeling

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.475 align:middle line:84%
is more that, OK, I'm
accessing the information,

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give it to
you right now, Ruben.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
They're telling me blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.436 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's almost like when
you work with clients and--

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Hearing it and kind
of translating it.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I will go into
a semi-conscious state

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
with clients, as
well, where then I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
allow the Pleidians, Yeshua,
whomever, in the moment,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to directly work
through my body.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.357 align:middle line:84%
Is there-- well, you
must resonate with all

00:06:01.357 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
the different frequencies.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise they wouldn't
be coming through.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:90%
But do you have a favorite?

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.995 align:middle line:84%
Or can you not say,
because that'll--

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I have a favorite?

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Depends on the day?

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really, it's
the Pleidians, Calliandra,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:90%
and Yeshua.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I could not pick one of
those out of the three.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
However, I am aware that I
have a very specific contract

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleidians.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's why they're
predominantly coming through

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've really noticed
that over the last year,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
especially, when I go into the
semi-conscious direct voice

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
channeling state, it's mostly
the Pleidians transmitting

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and then occasionally Yeshua,
Calliandra, the others, Lyrenz,

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Lemurians.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
In the past, there used to be
more of a variety in my work.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very aware that
for now, maybe we'll say

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
the Pleidians are my favorite.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Calliandra.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:90%
[GIGGLING]

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure she understands.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, she understands.

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
But she's like this right now.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe we can give her
some time to voice, as well.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
being a channeler--

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
or maybe this goes hand
in hand, because you're

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
also clairvoyant,
or clairaudient,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
or is that kind of
one and the same?

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So language is
very interesting.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we use it to help
us understand and label,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and then we can often
then limit and categorize.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Channels will use their
clairvoyant, their chlora,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
their clairsentient abilities
to help them access information.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am also,
as Nora, however,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
very intuitive, psychic,
clairvoyant, clairaudient,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
clairsentient.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit
different from channeling.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's me using my
own operating system.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have those
abilities, as well.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I've talked
with other, I guess,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
intuitive people,
in quotes, where

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to me, and after
hearing the process,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like they were
just tapping into like a more

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:90%
channeled type, you know.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't me, it
was, I heard a voice

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and this is what I'm getting.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
time, it's accurate.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But I just wondered how
your operating system works.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And really, when it
comes down to it,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
it's all information
coming from source energy,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
whether you access it
directly in your own body

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
or you access it from a
vibration or a frequency

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
outside of you,
we are all source.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
We are all that love
energy incarnate,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
it's just fun to get to
do it different ways.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the gifts of
being here on planet Earth.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
We get the variety
and the selection.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, and
yeah, getting to that--

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and maybe this is a question
later for the Palladians--

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
but by giving it these
labels, is that just more--

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because I've noticed
some people who

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.185 align:middle line:84%
are new to the intuitive
side of things,

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling energies,
they're hearing it,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.105 align:middle line:84%
but they don't,
maybe they don't know

00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%
how to categorize them right?

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Or is it even appropriate
to categorize it?

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.243 align:middle line:84%
How does that all,
when ultimately we're

00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to a place where
we're not labeling anything

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:84%
at all, how does-- does that
help us and does that serve us?

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it helps
initially to label,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
categorize to help the mental
body catch up and understand

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
what it is you're already doing
in your emotional and energetic

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and physical bodies.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.518 align:middle line:84%
And then once you achieve
that level of understanding,

00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:84%
it's very important to release
the labels and the attachments

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and just be in the moment.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Because then your
mind has relaxed.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So the mental body was
really set up to filter out--

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.295 align:middle line:84%
the third dimensional
mental body--

00:10:02.295 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
was set up to filter out
all of this input, all

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.236 align:middle line:90%
of this information.

00:10:08.236 --> 00:10:10.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Zoe, you are now part of--

00:10:10.282 --> 00:10:11.082 align:middle line:90%
officially.

00:10:11.082 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is Zoe.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Zoe.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Zoe is an elf and a unicorn.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We like to call
Zoe the elficorn.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Because she brings through
the elfen and the unicorn

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:90%
energies strongly in our space.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:90%
And we have--

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you have an
elf face, I can tell.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:10%
We have a couple of cats.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:10%
One is bringing
through the fairy

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:10%
vibration and the other
a Pleiadian frequency

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:10%
and vibration.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Animals, they are
definitely helping us here,

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:90%
on so many levels.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had Zoe now for
just a little over a year.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And she has brought with her
such an amazing transmission

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love
and fun and play.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Our entire reality has
shifted with her presence.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.598 align:middle line:84%
>> I've noticed that
with animals, they--

00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
if humans could operate
on an animal level,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
in so many ways, that--

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, where, it's
like they do something

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're mad at them, but
then they're in the doghouse,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
so to say, but two minutes
later, they're, oh, I

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't do anything.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, I forgive
you, or they can't--

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
even if you are physically
angry with them or something,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:90%
they'll, you know, it's OK.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate show
of how to forgive.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And also how to be present.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They're extremely in the moment.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't tie their
moments together in the way

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.383 align:middle line:90%
that they do--

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we do.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And they also don't
filter out the information

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that our mental
bodies filter out,

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
coming back around to
that-- thank you, Zoe.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm aware that Zoe and Izzy
and Ursula the Smurf, our cats,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
are always interacting
with the beings that

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:90%
are present in our space.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I see them watching the
beings and seeing things

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that I can't access
in the moment.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks, guys.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.986 align:middle line:84%
Let us know if
something pops in here.

00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we'll
catch it on film.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess the last
question, before we move in,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is when you were trying to
find labels, I guess, for the--

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
or if you weren't even trying,
but did they present themselves

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and say, I am such and such,
I am Pleiadian collective,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I am Calliandra.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it happened?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.932 align:middle line:90%
Or were you able to--

00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
how did that come
to you for each--

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So initially, it
wasn't that easy.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's what I figured.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
I want the story to this.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.891 align:middle line:90%
>> I wish.

00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:90%
With the Pleidians it was easy.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Immediately I recognized
the transmission

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiadians as a
Pleiadian transmission.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I recognized it in my
body in a visceral way.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It was very clear to me.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
That's who I was
in contact with.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been aware of
the Pleiadian energy.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So my mental body
had already accepted

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
the truth of the
Pleiadian collectives

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and their work with
us here on Earth.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So when they made
direct contact with me,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
my mental body didn't freak
out and try to screen out

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
that piece of information.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:90%
It was clear to me.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of the
other beings that I've

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
worked with, it's taken me
some time to kind of work

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
my way into discerning who
it was I was connecting with.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now when I say time, I
mean perhaps a matter

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:90%
of minutes or hours.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's never been
longer than that.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's just, I guess,
part of my operating system.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Calliandra, for
instance, when she first

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.988 align:middle line:84%
made herself known to me, I felt
a new being link up with me.

00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I was preparing for a
radio interview that night,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel this really
wonderful, playful presence.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I
knew it to be fairy.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So again, Nora had
accepted fairies.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:90%
That was easy.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I know this
vibration to be fairy.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:90%
So I asked for a name.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And I got the name,
initially, Calliana.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was playing with
Calliana, I was like, OK.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no,
that's not quite right.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I got oh,
it's Calliandra.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I heard, felt, and
that's really predominantly

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
how I access
information when I'm not

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.153 align:middle line:84%
in the semiconscious direct
voice channeling state.

00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> So like in a dream state?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So when Nora-- no, when
Nora is conscious and awake,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and when I choose to seek
out information as Nora,

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
meaning information I can't just
read from a book or you know,

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I feel it and I hear it.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I hear the words.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.617 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:47.325 align:middle line:84%
I see it sometimes
like words on a paper.

00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I see the story.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Very occasionally, I access more
of my clairvoyant abilities,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning I will see an
image, I'll see some light,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll see a story playing
out in my mind's eye.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So I felt, heard
the name Calliandra.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.492 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, her
name is Calliandra.

00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to go
outside and ground myself.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I was working with a
new vibration, a new frequency.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found it actually
really powerful and intense

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
to work with a fifth
dimensional being.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was used to working
with these very, very

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
high vibrations and
high frequencies, which

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:84%
were in some ways easier to
work with, because it's so--

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
well, any of you listening right
now, if you just take a breath,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you can tune into that, yes,
that light high-high vibration.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it's like
interacting with a cloud.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, gentle, easy, right.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Calliandra was like interacting
with a sledgehammer.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Her energy was so powerful.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.372 align:middle line:84%
Because she has more
density to her vibration

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
as a fifth dimensional being.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go outside
and stand on the ground.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I came in and sat
in front of my computer.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.882 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all right,
I'm going to look up the word

00:16:00.882 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Calliandra and see what I find.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to
also, if I can,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:84%
back up my other
dimensional information

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
with third dimensional
information.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And I googled the
word Calliandra,

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's a plant
called Fairy Duster.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'd not ever heard
that word before.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Fairy Duster.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was such a moment
of validation for me,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:90%
which was great.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.488 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go on
the radio that night

00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and introduce a new being.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So how wonderful
that I got that.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So the information you
got was Calliandra Fairy.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the validation
was Calliandra the name.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So that took me
a couple of hours

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to answer that question
and discerning frequencies

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
and vibrations.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I'm working
with a client and someone who's

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:84%
passed connects up with
me, you know, sometimes

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll feel immediately
like, oh, this

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:90%
is their mother who's passed.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's work that
I don't do a lot of,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
but I do it occasionally
when it's necessary.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They will present
themselves to me.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And then typically,
I'll just ask

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
some questions of the client.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Where's your mother, is
usually how I'll start,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to I've made
contact with your mother.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
Because that can be startling
for somebody who's lost, yes.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right off the bat, yeah.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But how about
so-called dark energies

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
or even manipulating tricksters
or these kinds of what

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
we see typically in
the movies, or actually

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
this whole experience,
you know, channeling

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
is kind of been made quite
negative in our media.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And with, you know, like,
what was it, "The Exorcist,"

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of thing.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I've interacted,
especially when I first started

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
channeling, had a couple of
interactions with energies that

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:84%
felt, that seemed to be wanting
to guide and seemed to be

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:90%
wanting to give information.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so initially,
it was interesting.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what I found happening
was I started feeling afraid.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.507 align:middle line:84%
Not of the being itself,
but of the information

00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:90%
they were giving me.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It was causing me to
feel afraid, afraid

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going to have
what I wanted in my life, afraid

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't really powerful.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So then I become aware,
oh, I'm accessing

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
another vibrational
energy that I

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be playing with.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> And then I would just--

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's how you could
kind of discern, too, which--

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.405 align:middle line:84%
>> --which energy is there,
just if it's doing some--

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:29.755 align:middle line:84%
if it's putting you in a
fear based state, then--

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:30.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:30.555 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're accessing
an energy and you

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.773 align:middle line:84%
start to feel bad in your
body, it's not really an energy

00:18:34.773 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:90%
you want to be playing with.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to do then is to
just send a big transmission

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional
love to that being

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and raise your own vibration.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That clears the being
out of your space.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It raises your energy.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you're able to reconnect
with those higher vibrational

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.805 align:middle line:84%
beings, and then you
can always, as well,

00:18:54.805 --> 00:18:57.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're already channeling--
so if you're familiar with

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:90%
the process--

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you can call on a
being that you know

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
to be of a higher
vibrational nature

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that you're familiar with
to kind of reconnect,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
solidify those connections.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard of cases
where energies start out good.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.532 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like,
almost like the church,

00:19:16.532 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, start out good with
good love and light messages,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and get people in.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And then somewhere
down the path,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the message can kind
of turn and then

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
start putting people in
a fear-based situation.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And then usually
after they get a bunch

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of people kind of already
in, you know very much

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:90%
like a church type scenario.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other issue that
you're touching on here

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
is, you know, as a channel,
you still have an ego.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So often what will happen is,
in those situations, the energy

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
itself stays in that
high vibrational state.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the filter that
alters, meaning the channel.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly
checking my filter.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly
having to disengage

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:84%
from any personal intention
or attachment to anything

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
personally for Nora
while channeling,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
or the person I'm
channeling for.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I were channeling for you,
Ruben, in a private session,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and I had a particular desire
for you for your success,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:84%
let's say, if I was
attached to that,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.087 align:middle line:84%
that would cloud my
ability to clearly discern

00:20:25.087 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
the information
that's coming through,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd put
my own spin on it.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking
about, I think,

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in those cults that have come
up around channels and things

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
like that, there's an imperative
underneath that the channel is

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
running for a prosperity
issue or relationship

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
issue or a sexual issue,
or whatever it is.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the being is
recommending everyone hand

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
over their money, when really
it's the channel speaking

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and the being has no
control over that.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other
wonderful thing

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
about this co-creative
work in channeling,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I can only bring through what I
allow myself to bring through.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They can't force
me to do anything.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So I can alter the message,
really, anytime I want.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You really have to keep
yourself in check, though.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of
lessons that I've

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
experienced in this
lifetime to remind

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
me to keep myself in check.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure they're guiding and
helping you do that, as well.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they are.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as you're
paying attention.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess when those others
that we talked about probably

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
aren't paying attention
or, you know, they're not--

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they're those
higher beings are probably

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:84%
screaming at them,
and then the ego

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:90%
kicks in and tunes them out.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I think those
things happen for karmic reasons

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
or because they've got
trauma they haven't resolved,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.433 align:middle line:84%
and that trauma begins
to spin this tale.

00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
you've got to look at here

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is anybody who gets pulled
in by something like that,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
they are a co-creator in
that experience, as well.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
They are willingly handing
over their free will

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to that entity or
that higher being.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's their
lesson, as well.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So then the channel,
who is bringing

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
through the information in that
way with their own, perhaps,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
distorted filter
is suddenly serving

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
to offer this lesson
to anybody who

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
wants to hand over
their free will

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and forget they're sovereign.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, so many people hand
over that freedom so easily.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're also
programmed to be enslaved.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
So we really--

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that a DNA
programming, you think?

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Or is that--

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's in our genetic code.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that we're
in the process of rewriting

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
as we integrate
our higher selves.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Because our higher ourselves
don't have that imperative

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.518 align:middle line:90%
to run the enslavement games.

00:23:02.518 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't have
genetics, do they?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, they don't.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But as we're integrating
our higher selves

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
into our third
dimensional chakra system,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
our higher selves
are interacting

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
with our physical
genetic structure.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm a bit going
into the channeling state.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.588 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not fully direct
voice channeling.

00:23:25.588 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you're paying
attention to me,

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.463 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see I look a
little different right now.

00:23:29.463 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Because my eyes are starting
to have a different focus.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians are just
reminding us right now

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that as we integrate
our higher selves,

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
we are altering
ourselves from the inside

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
out, physically,
genetically, as well,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:90%
and we're breaking down the--

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
greetings, this is the
Pleiadian collective, as always.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.565 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to have
the opportunity to link up

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
with you in this way.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll give you back
Nora, if you need her again--

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, this is
a good transition.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --in a moment.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:90%
