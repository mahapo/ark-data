00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.493 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.493 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So I have a few visuals.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my strongest one
is a woman from the council,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as, I would
say, an insectoid.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say Gray,
but it's tall, skinny,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and it has more
of antenna-style,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
instead of a human face,
if that makes sense.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe closer to a mantis?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, similar to
that type of breed,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.132 align:middle line:90%
or if that's what you call it.

00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
the question, those

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.885 align:middle line:84%
are the two collectives
that want to answer.

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.075 align:middle line:84%
OK, so depending on how
far back or what question,

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:90%
the draco also wants to respond.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
He says, most particularly, if
he references the shift over,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
which-- what we
were talking about,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
when the beings came
in and basically took

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
over our consciousness, he knows
a lot about that time period.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's start with Atlantis.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And I hate to put
a timeline on things,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
but I'm guessing around
25,000 years ago?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the woman says further
back than that, my love,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
but yes.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
A very special
time period indeed.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
would like to know?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that-- because I've heard
from other channels and other

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
guides that humanity
carries a lot of trauma from

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantean periods.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my
question would be, is

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
much of what we're dealing
with on the planet now,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.118 align:middle line:84%
is it tied into the
Atlantean energy?

00:04:18.118 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, I'm not sure
if I would call it traumas,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
though it does take some healing
to transform what has been

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
learned during this time
period and where you are moving

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:90%
toward.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
She says, you see, during
the Atlantean time period,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
consciousness had
grown exponentially

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and experiments
were taking place.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And yes, humanity as
well as other species

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
had to learn that this is not
how expansion was to occur

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in the most beneficial way.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So those that
understood this opted

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:90%
into a alternative experience--

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
an experience where
they could learn

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:90%
in a slightly different way.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So you may call it
traumatic in the sense

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that what once was known
was erased or taken,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:84%
but we would also like to
call it a teaching or learning

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
opportunity for the expansion of
humanity that they opted into.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Was the Annunaki
DNA injection,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
was that prior or after
the Atlantean experience?

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:90%
In our linear sense of time.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, right prior to
the diluvian time period with

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki, but there seems
to be a disconnect with what

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:90%
she's showing me.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing if she
can use verbals.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Basically, there seemed to be
an Atlantean time period further

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
back from when the
Annunaki actually came

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.715 align:middle line:90%
and created their hybrid human.

00:05:55.715 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she's showing me
that, with the diluvian waters,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
they erased all of this.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But some Annunaki saved
some of the humanoid

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to carry on that genetic
map that they created.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say "diluvian," can
you go into more detail about

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.453 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> She says the great flood
that we have known to be called

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:90%
the great flood.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
She says, this is a common
misconception in understanding

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
the human evolution,
because there were humanoids

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantean
time period, but we

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
would suggest that they were
more 5th dimensional beings.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
They were not essentially
what the human is today.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
That human is the
creation of what

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki created right prior
to this diluvian time period.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Annunaki borrowed
some DNA from that time period,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:90%
or from that energy?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just, I guess, the
Atlantean karma that we're

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
dealing with, is that just more
energetic as opposed to DNA?

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.588 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
She says, with reference
to your question,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I would say that this
is more energetic.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
It is a consciousness that
was tampered with in order

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the
consciousness of a humanoid.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:84%
She says, once again, the
Atlanteans were, she says,

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:90%
like a type of human species.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But they-- she's saying they're
not what you exactly think,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm asking her if she can be
more specific with the details

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
of how this all occurred.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
She says, basically, it's a
different type of humanoid.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher-evolved human
conscience that was there.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's different than what
the Annunaki created.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a mixture
of different beings?

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Where there Pleiadians,
and mantoids, and--

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> --Lyrans, and they were
all just having a big party?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> She says yes, but there
were also very select that had

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
a specific type of DNA.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But then things started to get
mixed in an experimental way,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:84%
she says, not in
necessarily a mating way.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
The Annunaki efforts
evolved into a mating

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
energetic manipulation
of the DNA.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So did the Annunaki
come after the Atlantean

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
destruction?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Was this great diluvian
flood, was that a reaction

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to the Atlantean experimentation
in technology and energy?

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying we think the
Atlantean happened before

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
as far as linear time period
compared to when the Annunaki

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
came and actually
manipulated the human DNA.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be a
disconnect with the human and

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean time period
versus the human

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
that the Annunaki created.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
There's a little bit different--

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> --energy, and the dimensional
frequency that that human is

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:90%
capable of being a part of.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Did we start this fall
back into third density after

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
the Atla-- so I guess, what
density was the Atlantean

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:84%
She says it's the fifth
dimension, fourth density.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying, part of the
confusion could be the shifting

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and the
part of waters rising.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that
the flood that we're

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
speaking of, the deluge
right after the Annunaki

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.485 align:middle line:90%
manipulated the human genome--

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, this is a second flood.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There seems to be
different floodings.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The great deluge, she's
saying, was intentional.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.212 align:middle line:84%
The flood that took out
Atlanta, she's saying,

00:10:25.212 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:90%
was a shifting of the planet.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
shifting later down the road,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:84%
after the deluge,
if that makes sense.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> She's just basically
apologizing for the timelines

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
of trying to construct in our
minds how it all played out.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But she understands it
with the evolution of how

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:90%
the Earth has cycled through.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that there
were other things that

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
happened during the
Atlantean time period that

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
took the destruction.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Chemical warfare, wars.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The waters could be
manipulated, but they

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
weren't used for this
specific purpose as they

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
were in the deluge
that we speak of,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.155 align:middle line:84%
the great flooding that was
meant to wipe out and reset

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:14.955 align:middle line:90%
the human species.

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was prior
to the Annunaki,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to wipe out the human species?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, in a linear format,
it would be Atlantean time

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
period in a fifth-dimensional
state with wars of chemicals,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.780 align:middle line:84%
experimentation,
and these sorts.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth changed
and shifted accordingly.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And the waters rose, and even
the land shifted and changed.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we could say that, for
some time, Earth was desolate.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the Annunaki came.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And they created the humanoid
based on their needs.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And she says things began
to spiral out of control,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, where they were
repeating the Atlantean time

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
period with their
experimentation,

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and understood
that now they would

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with the
energy accordingly,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and created a flooding
to reset the species.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Annunaki actually
created the flood.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this coming from
the higher-ups because they

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.672 align:middle line:84%
weren't, I guess,
according to the--

00:12:33.672 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I use the Star Trek
prime directive example

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
that there was some--

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the humans
was intervening a little more

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
than they were supposed to?

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So were they ordered
to do the flood?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> She says they didn't--

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:90%
it was not an order.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They felt that a
reset was necessary

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to undo the karmic
energy that they had done.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
She's bringing me back to
Atlantis, which is telling me

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that they understood
that the energy that

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
was created in Atlantis with
the experimentation led to--

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want, if you say bad
karma, or a learning curve.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to do
that, so they decided,

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.775 align:middle line:84%
let's reset everything, and
let's just make it right.

00:13:25.775 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.475 align:middle line:84%
And so they created
this flooding area.

00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
She's doing a lot more
visuals than verbals.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me, though,
that many were actually

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
sent away from where the
flood was to preserve.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But they also felt like they
were getting outnumbered,

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, and were
trying to just select

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
a few of the genomes that
they wanted to preserve.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
She says it basically, in
their minds, was a reset

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
so they wouldn't have to do
some of the energetic balance

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis had to
come face to face with.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But it still sounds like
we're repeating ourselves over

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
She says it's been very--

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:90%
she says karmic.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It's been very karmic.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds almost
like "Groundhog Day."

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> She says you cannot create
a species and say, oh, no,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
what have I done?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's reset.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:90%
She says, you cannot do this.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the creators-- the
Annunaki that you call them--

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
have had to go through their
own set of learning processes

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to redo the human species,
and not in the way

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that they had previously planned
in annihilating the genome.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They must help them into
higher consciousness.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> So they're our guides now.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, many have stepped
forward to try to help.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Does the Annunaki civilization
that came initially

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
to create this species,
does that still

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
exist in a fourth density,
or in a physical form?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Fourth or fifth?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, not in the way
that you would understand.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:90%
It has surpassed.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They have, she says, tried
to help in many instances.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have evolved to be
more light beings, in a sense.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.232 align:middle line:84%
They have stood by
humanity on a larger scale,

00:15:37.232 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:90%
and have tried to help.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And for this, they
have evolved greatly.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We would say that they
are further in dimension

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.615 align:middle line:90%
than what you speak of.

00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> So higher up in--

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:90%
almost a collective?

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> She says yes, but they still
desire to help humanity evolve

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
because of the karmic cycle
that had been created.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Because their greatest
desire is expansion as well.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been said that we have
DNA from various species--

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian, reptilian, Lyran.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there's many more.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Even Arcturian, and-- are all
of these different types of DNA

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
mixed in into the
Annunaki DNA already?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that where we get it from?

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Or did they take
from these other--

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> She says they didn't take.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Borrowed for other trades.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Their DNA is not 100% your DNA.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is unique
in the fact that it

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
comes from all
different star systems.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that in order to
create the perfect humanoid,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:90%
they needed to do this.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What was their goal?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I keep hearing it sounds like it
was more complicated than just

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
to create a species
to mine their gold.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying
conquering other worlds.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.169 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking her to clarify
what she means by that.

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Being able to
inhabit this world,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and to conquer it,
and move on to others,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
it is almost like having
children and letting

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:90%
them rule the planet.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
She says it wasn't
meant to be negative.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just to have a planet--

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
a dominionship, and then to move
forward into other planetary

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:90%
regions, and to rule that.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds almost reptilian.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Is that consciousness
prevalent in the Annunaki?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> She's smiling.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
She says, it's only reptilian,
but yes, you are correct.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:90%
The Annunaki are very--

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:90%
kinship?

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Very ruling-ship type.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And they create
and procreate based

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
on the fact that they can
pass down to their family,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
she says, like, regions.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Heirs.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Heirs to the kingdom.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in regions.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
it was a planet.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds--
because that still

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
has a hierarchy-type,
ownership-type energy to it.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
maybe the Annunaki

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.392 align:middle line:90%
have moved beyond that now?

00:18:39.392 --> 00:18:40.975 align:middle line:84%
>> She says we believe
that they have.

00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They are working hard
to undo the mindsets

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness that
are now unbeneficial to you

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:90%
that they have created.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
She says, you do see yourselves
often as hierarchical beings,

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and have organized
your world accordingly.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:84%
This comes from the Annunaki,
and they understand this,

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and they are working
to unfold this.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:84%
She says, but there
are benefits to having

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
a hierarchical system, and
they understand this as well.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
The key is to maintain
that we are all unified,

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.756 align:middle line:84%
and we all have our special
role within God source energy.

00:19:18.756 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What about-- at what point
do the reptilian roles come

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:90%
into this?

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like, maybe because we
have this Annunaki hierarchical

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
energy, that maybe
we were open to--

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
having that energy
already opened us

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
up to inviting a reptilian
energy at some point.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> She says you are very
correct in believing this.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians have a very
compassionless perspective,

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and so their idea
is to dominate.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind that
the Annunaki as a whole

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:90%
is not just reptilian.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They are-- she's saying
a unique species.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking her to pinpoint
if I can get a region.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds almost Orion.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm getting like a
conglomerate of maybe just--

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there are
reptilian in this region,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and also, like, blondes.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleiadians.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.368 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like they're
working together,

00:20:30.368 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's who we
call the Annunaki.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And I even feel like there's
insectoids involved with this.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have reptilian,
insectoids, and the humanoid,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
or the Pleiades part of Orion
being the Annunaki creators.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the insectoids'
roles in this mix?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Donating DNA.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They helped with
constructing the genome.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
They help with
intuitive abilities.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The empathic and intuitive
side of the human

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:90%
comes from the insectoids.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
The survival skills often
come from the reptoids.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:22.405 align:middle line:84%
And being able to, she says
survive under harsh conditions,

00:21:22.405 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:90%
these type of things.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:90%
You need these things.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Even though they can
often feel dense,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
you need the DNA from
these type of species.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
She's bringing me back to
part of the question earlier

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:90%
that we spoke of, the reptoids.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> When did they come in?

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:84%
At what point in
our history did we

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:90%
allow that energy to come in?

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.765 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she wants to talk
about the hierarchy,

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
because that helps
understand it.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that all these
beings understand hierarchy.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the reptoid.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Even the Pleiades
understand that there

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
must be some type of
hierarchical collaboration

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:90%
formed in order for order--

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Structure.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
She says it's not saying
that others are greater

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:90%
or others are lesser.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way to
keep organization.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
She says, now, that
being said, if the higher

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
look down upon the lower
as lesser, and the lesser

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:84%
feel that they are lesser, that
is when the domination occurs

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and the consciousness can shift.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But let me talk
about timeline first,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and then I can
explain to you some

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
of the other beings behind
the agendas that-- what

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
you would call reptilian.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, let's call
them the serpent species.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But this doesn't necessarily
mean that they are reptoid

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It means that they are of
the serpent star system.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking her if it's
like that Alpha Draconis.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> She says yes, but
it's also bigger.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Something that the
ancients knew of.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:84%
They called it the serpent
star system, basically.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was a serpent
species because they

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:90%
came from that location.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.165 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.165 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking her to give
me a linear time of when

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness transitioned.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's just showing
me a lot of dragon stuff,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not understanding.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can get
her to give me numbers.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
She's not giving me a time
period of when consciousness

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:90%
really changed.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it might
be such a slow process

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's hard to give a date.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:07.285 align:middle line:84%
Was the Annunaki intervention
pre-dinosaur era, or after?

00:24:07.285 --> 00:24:09.748 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to say pre.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:10.726 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, but it also
depends on the regions.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Some regions didn't
inhabit the beings--

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and she's referring
to the dinosaurs--

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:90%
for quite some time.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And even then, more humans
were able to occupy the area,

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:90%
or land dominated species.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So were dinosaurs more of
human's natural evolution?

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Or was their
genetic manipulation

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
with the dinosaurs
coming to Earth?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I'm asking
her to slow down.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:84%
There was some natural evolution
process with the dinosaur

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
species, but it basically
was put forth on the surface

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to start as a testing point
to see what type of species

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
could survive, what
type of evolution

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
would occur on its own,
what type of things

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
need to tampering in order to
survive these type of things.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
She says, and this is why
we say that time periods are

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
difficult, because there were
areas where dinosaurs were only

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:84%
able to survive for a brief
time, other places where they

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
were able to survive
and thrive quite freely.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the areas and the regions
helped dictate the time period,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.727 align:middle line:84%
as well as where
humans were able to go.

00:25:38.727 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I assume that's the
same for humans too.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Different pockets of
humans, different areas,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:90%
could survive longer.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
That's very good to think that,
because in different regions,

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
your genetic genome
needed certain, she says--

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I might call it upgrades in
order for you to survive.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to
think, or to have

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the ability within your body
to survive longer than needed.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to the
Atlantean Annunaki karma,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
then the dinosaur karma,
was the asteroid--

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is it true, as our
scientists are figuring out,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that asteroid created
the extinction event

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, the
reset for the dinosaurs?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, we think that
they are on the right path.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there is a
little bit more to it.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:84%
There were chemicals
that were set forth

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.675 align:middle line:90%
to create fires and erosion--

00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I feel like maybe that
could be earthquakes--

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.468 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.875 align:middle line:84%
>> --in order to
offset the species.

00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> To reset things a little bit?

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> With the dinosaurs
specifically is what

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.548 align:middle line:90%
she's showing me.

00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's a
couple different times when

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:84%
this happened, based on
what she's showing me.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe more than
one extinction event.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And this one doesn't
seem to do with water.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems to do more
with gases and fire.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of burning
around the regions

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that she's showing
me, and earthquakes.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And I understand that
all this is for different

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:90%
evolution--

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution of various
species, and animals, plants,

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
humanoids, dinosaurs, et cetera.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Why does the earth itself
need to have all this stuff

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:90%
going on?

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
What is it getting
out of all this?

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying that it just has
to go through its own planetary

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
cycle, just as a cell
would gain expansion,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:84%
or she says maybe what
you would call evolution,

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:84%
through going through
a little bit of stress.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Strain and division,
these kind of things,

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.165 align:middle line:84%
it's just part of the way
she says the universe works.

00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It isn't to hurt
Gaia, she says.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It's to help it
transition, and to reach

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:90%
into higher consciousness.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.067 align:middle line:84%
Many of other
planets do the same.

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:29.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.975 align:middle line:84%
Just to go back to our history
a little bit more, then,

00:28:35.975 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and the different energies
and beings, these other races,

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
this borrowed DNA that we
were created from, did they--

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming they also
signed up for that.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Loaning their DNA.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
What was their intention?

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:84%
What were, say, the Pleiades'
intention, and reptilians,

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Or Zeta.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Do we have Zeta DNA?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying no, not
the Annunaki creation.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in a roundabout
way, as Zeta DNA

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
can be shared in a roundabout
way with other species.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But you have not
been transplanted

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:90%
with their direct DNA.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But there had been
multiple experimentations

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
on the Zetas' part prior to
the Annunaki taking control.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, to answer
the question about the DNA

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
exchange, they were all to be
a part of the interactions,

00:29:53.010 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and all to share it, and have
their regions accordingly to--

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
she says maybe what
you call family.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say that
a family from the Pleiades

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
had a region to
control and dominate

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth's surface.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And a reptilian
would have an area.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:23.947 align:middle line:84%
She says the insectoids that we
speak of, they were mixed in.

00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:24.780 align:middle line:90%
There was a mixture.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
They were in agreement
to divide, dominate,

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and to be in their regions.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And this also remains still up
into the galaxies as well as

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a contract for,
she says, like the souls.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:90%
They agreed upon it.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:90%
There was no good or bad.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.185 align:middle line:84%
There was just-- she says it
was almost like a big family.

00:30:58.185 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So to create a place,
a meeting ground

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to mix the energy so we
can get along better.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well,
what's the intent?

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:90%
The intent, she says, to create.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Just to create.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Just to be godlike,
to create something.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:90%
But they needed other DNA.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do it
solely with one DNA

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Earth.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't applicable.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So the earth environment
itself is pretty unique, then,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, in
this instance, yes.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.415 align:middle line:84%
They needed multiple
types of DNA.

00:31:36.415 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Even mammalian.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Mammalian was used.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was understood
that only--

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.600 align:middle line:90%
she's showing me leaders.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That there would only
be a certain group

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:90%
of leaders for this.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So they did the
exchange accordingly.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that part
of also the exchange

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
was for the leaders
to not inhibit

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
certain parts of the planet if
they could exchange the DNA,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.495 align:middle line:84%
and they would be protected, if
that makes sense, in regions.

00:32:18.495 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The regions
would be protected.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I-- she's
showing me a lot of dolphins

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
and mammalians in the waters.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
They were not to dominate
the waters in the way

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that they did the land.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And for that, they
could exchange DNA.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So there were these
contracts and agreements.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So that would be
the Sirian energy?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:84%
That Sirian soup of
our human experience?

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.665 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:54.165 align:middle line:84%
So where are we
going with all this?

00:32:54.165 --> 00:32:55.396 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:55.396 --> 00:32:56.196 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:32:56.196 --> 00:32:57.488 align:middle line:90%
>> So why is this so important?

00:32:57.488 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it so important that
we have this galactic soup here

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, well, for one case,
for one thing that we really

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
want to drive home, so to
speak, in the human species

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is to understand
there's no good and evil.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The serpent species
has been termed

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:84%
as the evil, the
benevolent, the Pleiades,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
working together.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
She says, but what you have
are individual consciousness,

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, or beings
that individually

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
selected to dominate
in an unbeneficial way.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And they get blamed for--

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Basically to-- she
says, we want to go back

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:84%
to the serpent
species, because we

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:84%
have spoken that they
are not all reptilian.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:00.960 align:middle line:84%
The serpent species
also has beings

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that have used the domination
for evil purposes, quote

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
unquote, she says, to
take over consciousness.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
look like reptiles.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we've
pinned the reptile

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.352 align:middle line:84%
as the bad, the benevolent
blondes as the god good.

00:34:24.352 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, because
that's what we look like.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLING] We're
good, you're bad.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Anything that looks different.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But I almost feel like
they were good, so to speak.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to be creator gods.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And other species from
the serpent species

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:84%
used that power to dominate
the human consciousness,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.910 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So in my research, I've been
trying to get to the ar--

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to
archetypal energies.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And it almost sounds like maybe
my archetypes are a little off.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Using an archetype is
only going back so far.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:12.081 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like there's more to
the story than just archetypes.

00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Consider once again the
part of your question

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:84%
where you brought
in the dinosaurs.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
They are survival,
but their DNA is

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:90%
key in the planetary creation.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
consider this, you

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
consider that the human
is a large part of this,

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.045 align:middle line:84%
so to hate them would
be to hate yourself.

00:35:33.045 --> 00:35:34.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> She's saying, also consider
what we speak of the serpent

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, when you
do your research,

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:84%
go back and find that there is
serpent species, serpent race,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.095 align:middle line:90%
these type of callings--

00:35:50.095 --> 00:35:50.895 align:middle line:90%
names.

00:35:50.895 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:84%
She says, see if you can't
tap in and see the visuals,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and see that not all
are actually reptiles.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Some look, she says,
more mammalian.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:90%
All kinds.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:90%
All kinds, she says.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Even some bird.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> They represent the reptilian
agenda that you now reference

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:90%
in today's timeline, though.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
The conquering the
human consciousness.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when you hear reptilian,
this is what you think of.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.560 align:middle line:84%
When you hear
serpent, you think,

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:90%
oh, the reptilian domination.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But the serpent species is
actually a broader idea.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do know,
in our own evolution,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:84%
how birds are linked to
the reptilian energy.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The avians are quite
close in the family.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
is that the Pleiadians

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of that
energy already

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:90%
as well-- the bird energy, or.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> She says they do.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.375 align:middle line:84%
And remember, they
work together.

00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:90%
They understand one another.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she's showing
me some visuals

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:84%
with the Pleiades actually
having large families.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:28.682 align:middle line:90%
They sort of--

00:37:28.682 --> 00:37:30.147 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting spacey because--

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, she's trying to
get through to me.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> They were the first advocates
of one male, several females,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
because they understood the
lineage and the importance

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.980 align:middle line:84%
of carrying on down
the bloodlines.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
This came from your
Orion star system,

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:57.430 align:middle line:84%
but it has turned into
something negative.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But that which you call God
came from this sort of idea

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that lineage could be carried
down through the bloodlines

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:90%
and to--

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you back up and
explain that what we call God?

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:90%
You mean the male figure of God?

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, she says,
like, Abrahamic covenant.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:84%
That idea of God,
the image of God,

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.280 align:middle line:84%
she's saying that she
just wants humanity

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there
are beings of Orion that

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
have a very male dominant
type of energy that

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:90%
have brought that to Earth.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
The rulingship of
the man, basically,

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and passing it down through
the bloodlines into the males.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.450 align:middle line:84%
She says, mainly,
though, because also,

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
a man can have several
children with different wives

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and pass his seed along to
ensure that his kingdom would

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.690 align:middle line:90%
be maintained accordingly.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And he can pass down his
lineage and his ideas that way.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But that comes from not
necessarily reptilian.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, that's
an Orion energy.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
She says, not saying that
we live like that here.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We're just saying that that
was incorporated with that idea

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:90%
from us, from the Orion.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It was part of our DNA.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:19.162 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That we carry that energy.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I guess we're
working through that.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not serving
us anymore, so we're

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.480 align:middle line:90%
evolving past that now, or--

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:90%
some of us.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> She says you're moving
past the rulingship.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.940 align:middle line:84%
There is still the idea behind a
man being able to have children

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
from several other wives
that can also be beneficial

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:84%
because we are still
mammalian, in a large sense,

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and we are working
toward building

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
more of the community
based on that idea.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, but
it also all goes

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
back to your original
concerns and questions

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:84%
with the reptilian
and the rulingship

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:07.490 align:middle line:84%
now, that the rulers and the
kings and the queens, that

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:90%
is a reptilian idea.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.170 align:middle line:90%
She says it's not necessarily--

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I understand
now what she's

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
trying to convey, as far as, I
had this concept of hierarchy

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and ruling being
a reptilian idea.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:90%
And sounds like that's--

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:84%
there's some aspects of that
in the reptilian lineage,

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:84%
but that's not a
reptilian, so to say--

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
that aspect particularly isn't
just from the reptilians.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But my understanding of that
reptilian archetype is a very

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.388 align:middle line:90%
male, masculine energy.

00:40:44.388 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I've also understood
that the Pleiadians

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:84%
has been more of a
feminine, a softer energy.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And the merging of the two,
the Annunaki, and then us,

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.945 align:middle line:84%
creating, adding extra
spices in there, it seems.

00:40:58.945 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> She says, that is true.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
One thing to note, though,
is that the male side

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleiade region
is more like a mentor--

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
teacher.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And that can take on
that feminine side,

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:84%
but also understands
the male role.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.600 align:middle line:84%
The feminine side of
the reptilian, she says,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:84%
is gaining wisdom and
working that into knowledge

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:90%
with teaching the youth.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Those type of things.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Creating a better lifestyle for
communities with technology,

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
business, she says.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is a little bit
of both that is different.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But we have interpreted the male
energy is dominant, and maybe

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:57.510 align:middle line:84%
perhaps controlling, because
that is what the humans have

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.010 align:middle line:90%
perceived it to be for so long.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what we
experienced here.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Or at least our history and
what we remember so far.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming as we
uncover our history,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
we can break free of some
of these stereotypes of what

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.685 align:middle line:90%
a male is, what a female is.

00:42:17.685 --> 00:42:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:84%
She says, one more thing to
add is the serpent species

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.470 align:middle line:84%
as we spoke of-- or
reptilians-- don't

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:84%
tend to hide the
masculinity in that sense.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The Orion side, they
understand that,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and they allow it to occur.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:90%
But they also know how to--

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:84%
she says mask it in a sense
with their ability to teach.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But there still is a
bit of a masculine side

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that they incorporate,
or have incorporated

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.930 align:middle line:90%
into the human experience.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, where we're going with
all this, getting back to that,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems like humans
are going to have--

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe not the way the Annunaki
had originally intended,

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but we still are going to have a
strong presence in this galaxy.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:84%
That is key to, say,
teaching, because you

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:22.440 align:middle line:84%
have entered into the 3D world
that has benefited you greatly

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.850 align:middle line:84%
in understanding and learning
in a subconscious way.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And now that you are fully
awakening and becoming

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
conscious, you now can
become the teachers

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and allowing others to
understand their full capacity.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, it has been
very beneficial for you

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.420 align:middle line:84%
to experience the world
in the way that you have.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It has been-- she
says, what we have

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:84%
called an excellent
simulation of learning.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:43:54.603 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And these other races
that are part of us that

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:01.363 align:middle line:84%
are observing humanity
now, and have been,

00:44:01.363 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming they're
learning a lot just

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.875 align:middle line:90%
by the observation process.

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They've realized a
lot of their mistakes

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because of how we've dealt
with what they've taught us.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have evolved
because of it,

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:84%
because they are working
to undo some of this,

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and expanding themselves
into other areas of thinking.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.620 align:middle line:84%
She says, initially,
it was done to protect

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the human race, the human
species, the DNA that

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:84%
was created, these type
of things, and to let you

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.140 align:middle line:90%
have the best life possible.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But of course, things
transpired the way

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:84%
they did, where beings
took over consciousness.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And they see both perspectives.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is important
in expansion.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:10%
>> When you say beings
took over consciousness,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:10%
is this going back
to the reptilian,

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:10%
this integration of the
downgrade into third density?

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:09.780 align:middle line:84%
She says it's back into the
serpent race, which is not

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.230 align:middle line:84%
necessarily the serpent,
but beings that wanted

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:90%
to take over consciousness.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And then now you have lower
dimensional reptilians that--

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:90%
she says, and others.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.270 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want me
to limit it to that.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But others that like to maintain
control over the consciousness.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And because of
the energy where

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.605 align:middle line:84%
we're at in our evolution, that
was sort of an easy gateway

00:45:35.605 --> 00:45:36.405 align:middle line:90%
into that?

00:45:36.405 --> 00:45:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.220 align:middle line:84%
They understood the
cycle of the planet.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They understood
that when the planet

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:84%
cycled in a particular way,
that it opened a gateway--

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:84%
as you spoke of-- to enter
into lower consciousness.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Annunaki and
higher beings of dimensions

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.400 align:middle line:84%
were forced to leave
because they could not

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
re-enter in the same way
that they w-- they were not

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.430 align:middle line:84%
able to appear to humans
like they had before,

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and guide them.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything was subconscious,
she said, at that point.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So almost like
getting contact now,

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:84%
for many of us who are
having dream experiences.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.990 align:middle line:84%
When things become
too dense, then that's

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.800 align:middle line:90%
really the only gateway in.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Where, maybe on some
parts of the Earth,

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:34.160 align:middle line:84%
where the actual physical
area is in a higher frequency,

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:90%
then those can be gateways of--

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.925 align:middle line:84%
doorways in for higher
dimensional beings, physically.

00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And also consider, there
were several attempts

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:middle line:84%
before this transition, while
we were making contact with you

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:84%
with the humans to
try to pull them out

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of this sort of mindset
that they were getting taken

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:90%
or putting a hold on to.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But the humans
wouldn't allow it.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They still worshipped
the gods that

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:84%
led them into avenues
that were unbeneficial.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They still desired trade and
money over spiritual things

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:18.120 align:middle line:84%
at this point, and we
could not reach them.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.400 align:middle line:84%
She says, so we were asked to
leave by the consciousness,

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.986 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:47:23.986 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:90%

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.752 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't an outside source.

00:47:27.752 --> 00:47:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it wasn't out--

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, in a sense, but you
had helped to push you along.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You had the choice
all along, though.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Do we always have-- we always
have that choice initially,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.295 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> She says yes, but it can
be very, very difficult.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But now, it
seems the choice--

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that doorway has come
to us again, and now--

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.760 align:middle line:84%
at least the timeline
I choose to be in,

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:84%
it seems that we are
making that choice

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to let in our higher frequency
brothers and sisters come in--

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.697 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:48:04.697 --> 00:48:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --and make the shift
the other direction,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:07.330 align:middle line:90%
because we've--

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> She says many of us are
wanting and hoping to come back

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that we had
that contact with you prior.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're hoping
that you remember

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that some part of
your consciousness

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.580 align:middle line:84%
remembers that you once had had
contact in that similar way,

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and that everything was OK.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Was the last gateway
for this energy,

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.776 align:middle line:84%
was this back in
the Egyptian days?

00:48:30.776 --> 00:48:34.373 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like she's
showing me Rome.

00:48:34.373 --> 00:48:35.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a gateway
in Rome, and--

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>> In Rome.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:36.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what year's there,
but I feel like it's further--

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:50.130 align:middle line:10%
so would it be Brutus, I
think, is what she's saying?

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Brutus and Augustus, I think.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.002 align:middle line:90%
Which is--

00:48:55.002 --> 00:48:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, I
totally failed history.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:57.670 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.000 align:middle line:90%

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I know why I
do, because I was just not

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:90%
interested.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Now it's interesting.

on other channelings--

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to step
aside from her for a sec--

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness was
one of the last hopes

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.425 align:middle line:84%
to try to bring
that out of people

00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and understand their power.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was a lot of
ET interaction at the time,

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of beings still
coming as angelic forms.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And then shortly
after that, there

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:84%
was the close of the gateways,
like you talked about.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And then probably
prior to that would

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:90%
have been Egyptian days, yeah.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:38.187 --> 00:49:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And what role did the Buddha
energy on the planet take?

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
slightly before Christ,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.610 align:middle line:90%
but after the Egyptian era.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> She says to bring peace.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Peace within the self.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Connection within the self.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Also a preparation
for what was to come.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:08.450 align:middle line:84%
To be able to match up to what
not only Christ consciousness,

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:12.470 align:middle line:84%
she says, but the one
last loop to understand

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:14.030 align:middle line:90%
what the human was capable of.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.520 align:middle line:90%
The one last loop.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.495 align:middle line:90%
Could you--

00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:19.565 align:middle line:84%
>> She says like what
we spoke of before.

00:50:19.565 --> 00:50:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Before that gateway was closing,
they anticipated the close

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.490 align:middle line:90%
shortly after Christ's death.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was so-- it was like
a pre-dimensional door opening

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to prep people to--

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it was a
time for peace, and to prep.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.780 align:middle line:90%

>> Mm.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the Tibetan
energy, there's

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:90%
the Buddhist influence now.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like there's more
ancient stuff going on there

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.380 align:middle line:90%
prior to Buddha's influence.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.460 align:middle line:84%
What kind of gateway
are we looking at there?

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:84%

lot of visuals with African.

that correlates.

Let me see if I can get
her to just tell me.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:84%
There just seems
to be a correlation

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.690 align:middle line:84%
with some type of
tribe in Africa

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.990 align:middle line:90%
that branched off somehow.

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.255 align:middle line:84%
It might be beyond my
library of understanding.

00:51:24.255 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:90%

Egyptian civilization.

What kind of influence
in that civilization,

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.825 align:middle line:84%
and where did that
civilization go?

00:51:51.825 --> 00:51:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.893 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I got a lot
of Grays, actually,

00:51:56.893 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:90%
that she's showing me.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:02.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:05.130 align:middle line:84%
There are reptilian-type

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if she can give
me any other information

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.203 align:middle line:90%

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.010 align:middle line:90%

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I asked her, what was it for?

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.810 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.953 align:middle line:90%
A facilitating compound.

00:52:50.953 --> 00:52:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they're trying
to build something there.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.935 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me that
these beings are--

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how do I put
this into words?

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.720 align:middle line:84%
They are meeting
together at this temple,

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.698 align:middle line:84%

constructing things.

The beings are very ancient.

00:53:17.742 --> 00:53:18.950 align:middle line:90%
You said it was pre-Egyptian?

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that makes sense.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:23.084 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.084 --> 00:53:26.374 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if she can give
me anything else about that.

00:53:26.374 --> 00:53:29.150 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING]

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So facilitating

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:54.762 align:middle line:90%
Even some mining, she's saying.

00:53:54.762 --> 00:53:58.102 align:middle line:90%
It's using for mining.

00:53:58.102 --> 00:53:59.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she's showing
me that some animals

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:04.610 align:middle line:84%

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to be almost
a direct communication.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
A communication device, but not
a portal for physical beings

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.920 align:middle line:90%
coming and going.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> She says it did have
portal capabilities,

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:31.460 align:middle line:84%
but it was more of
a transcription.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Transcription device.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Is transcription writing?

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I have transcribed.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, to describe.

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:43.782 align:middle line:84%
>> So they were probably getting
information, and using that.

00:55:43.782 --> 00:55:45.650 align:middle line:90%
She's just showing me visuals.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:46.780 align:middle line:90%
There's not much else.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a big light
coming from it, but.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:84%
How about the Nazca
South American area?

00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We recently exca-- there's
been some excavations

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and some bodies
have being found,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:06.270 align:middle line:84%
sort of reptilian
three-fingered beings.

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.998 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.998 --> 00:56:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking if she can--

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:84%
or if there's a being
that can help use words.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the visuals
that she was showing me

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:31.970 align:middle line:84%
were these structures aligning
to be a teleportation device.

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.905 align:middle line:84%
And then beings were able
to come through that.

00:56:39.905 --> 00:56:45.668 align:middle line:90%


00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can
get more about what

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.560 align:middle line:90%
their role was, what they did.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:57:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:08.572 align:middle line:90%
OK, so she said they were also--

00:57:08.572 --> 00:57:11.385 align:middle line:84%
I feel like she's saying
they were here to help mine.

00:57:11.385 --> 00:57:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Back in the Annunaki days?

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm, that's not clear.

00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:17.965 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:17.965 --> 00:57:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They were facilitating through
teleportation locating places.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And then she showed me mining.

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.908 align:middle line:90%


00:57:31.908 --> 00:57:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Based on what she
was saying, there's

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.170 align:middle line:84%
something to do with
teleportation and mining

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:41.560 align:middle line:84%
with those beings, as far as
what I asked about the role.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Timelines, I'm not sure about.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.225 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they're
earlier than--

00:57:48.225 --> 00:57:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:01.300 align:middle line:84%
she's showing me before the
first people along the Aztec.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So there was different
timelines for Aztec people,

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:07.270 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayans, prior to that.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how that
all plays in to history.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.965 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.965 --> 00:58:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel like she's
even showing me

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.910 align:middle line:84%
that it's even before the
humanoid was even built.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.615 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's before-- yeah.

00:58:20.615 --> 00:58:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Even before the
Annunaki came through?

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> She says no.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Just right after, to assist
the teleportation devices.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:40.005 align:middle line:84%
>> They were assisting
the Annunaki?

00:58:40.005 --> 00:58:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

00:58:40.805 --> 00:58:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:84%
They were given land
rights for assistance

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because they had certain
knowledge of teleportation

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki
needed help with.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:58.118 align:middle line:84%
She says, or we could even
just say beings on the planet,

00:58:58.118 --> 00:58:59.660 align:middle line:84%
because not all of
them were creating

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.570 align:middle line:90%
the human at that time.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:06.720 align:middle line:84%
There were other
beings that could come,

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.630 align:middle line:84%
but the Annunaki
established Earth

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:middle line:84%
as their planet
for the long run,

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and so created the human
to establish their domain.

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.056 align:middle line:84%
But other beings were coming
and going at that time,

00:59:18.056 --> 00:59:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and this was one of them.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When did the quote
unquote quarantine--

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.915 align:middle line:84%
that, let's say, loose term
we use for these beings

00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:31.715 align:middle line:90%
to stop coming--

00:59:31.715 --> 00:59:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So she says that there are
two parts to that question.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.900 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that she's
giving me the 1950s, 1960s,

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that there were some
more rules put in place

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.810 align:middle line:90%
with actual visitations.

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:47.368 align:middle line:84%
But then, going back to where
we could physically see them

00:59:47.368 --> 00:59:49.160 align:middle line:84%
on a day-to-day like
we were talking about,

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that is in the Roman time
period when things transitioned.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so prior to the Roman
era, there was more ET--

00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.280 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --traffic?

00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:58.570 --> 00:59:59.570 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So let me see if
I can get her to--

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.440 align:middle line:84%
about 100 to 200
years after what

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we know as Christ's death,
that's when things transitioned

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.220 align:middle line:84%
where there were no more
visitations from light beings

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.230 align:middle line:90%
in this quite the same way.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
She says, but when you
speak of visitations

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.590 align:middle line:90%
from other planets--

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
like we spoke of other
beings just coming--

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
there were more stricter
guidelines put in place,

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
she says, after the
1950s into the 1960s.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that because we had such
a flux of ET activity after

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.347 align:middle line:90%
the nuclear bombs?

01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm asking her why that
is and she's showing me

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:41.330 align:middle line:90%
the presidents.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.200 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Would it be Nixon?

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Roosevelt.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Roosevelt.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I think.

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever president-- sorry,
whatever president it was.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me the
president had some--

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's also some
from other countries.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.073 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me
they basically--

01:01:05.073 --> 01:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it all went down,

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.198 align:middle line:84%
but there were some
rules put into place.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:12.410 align:middle line:90%


01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that Earth has been
quarantined in different ways

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.910 align:middle line:90%
at several different times.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And because of what
we spoke of prior,

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
the light beings were not
able to come visit the humans

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.640 align:middle line:84%
in quite the same way
because it had dropped down

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.370 align:middle line:90%
into lower density.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you speak of
other density beings that

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
could resonate with a
similar frequency on Earth

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and come down and make some
type of contact were forbidden.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.690 align:middle line:90%


01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And the threat was,
if they continued,

01:01:53.710 --> 01:02:00.730 align:middle line:84%
more chemical use
would be chosen.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's kind of been a trade,
then, on both sides for, OK,

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.325 align:middle line:84%
we won't intervene if
you don't intervene.

01:02:07.325 --> 01:02:08.125 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> She says it was
like, don't bother us.

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
If you do, more chemicals
will be expelled.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking you how did
that happen, though.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
She just said
communication lines.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
However they're communicating.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, how did these
agreements come through?

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as far as
with our governments.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
How did that all happen?

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
She says through
communication lines.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So I would assume that
might not be face to face,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.700 align:middle line:90%
but however they communicate.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, more people are having
experiences, and interactions,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:53.245 align:middle line:90%
and dreamtime experiences.

01:02:53.245 --> 01:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Are we at another gateway, or
was 2012 one of these gateways?

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so she's
nodding yes to 2012.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It was the start of
the opening, she says.

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The door knob turning and
opening was what 2012 was.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And now we are slowly pushing
that door open more and more.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And then she visually
showed me the door

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
opening with the visual
of several different kinds

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
of beings, and
that's where the hope

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
is, to open that door to a point
where we can visually see them

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
once again.

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
She says, and have contact
and visual experiences

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
as we once had.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So getting back
to our history,

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
it just sounds like the human
soup of all these different

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
beings over our history
of interaction, and DNA,

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and energies.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been one big
evolutionary experiment.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> She likes that you say
the evolutionary experiment.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because we--
or the Annunaki,

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
the creators-- are all
involved with the creators

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
are expanding in just the same
that the human consciousness

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:03.230 align:middle line:90%
is.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was previously
misunderstood.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess, ultimately,
the goal of all of this,

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
is it to integrate back
into source, oneness,

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
through all these different
paths of integration?

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And with that, to
understand that living

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
in this third density has been
beneficial for your learning,

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
because now you can
become the teachers

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and expand even more fully
into the source energy

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that we are all trying
to, what you might say,

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.825 align:middle line:84%
make sense of or understand
within our hearts.

01:04:41.825 --> 01:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So kind of like an
Alcoholics Anonymous.

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It takes the former alcoholic
to help teach the others about--

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been in their shoes,

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:05.165 align:middle line:84%
to teach them how to get out
of or stop the addictions.

01:05:05.165 --> 01:05:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> She says yes.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And because you see
that there is a paradigm

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
allowed here on Earth,
or a sort of game shift--

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
let's see if I can have
her better term that--

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
matrix-style living, you
understand perhaps the mindsets

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
that can trap you
into that space.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> The enslavement programs.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, there are
others elsewhere

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
that have fairly
similar mindsets.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can be their
guides and teach them

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
ways to expand past beyond
what you call the matrix,

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
or the game playing.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But how would you know if
you hadn't had some of that

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.080 align:middle line:90%
in your perspective?

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And is that why--

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the Pleiadians,
and we know the Orions,

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure the reptilians,
all of these different races

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that we're interacting
now with, at some point

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
in their evolution have had
these enslavement games.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> She said, I will agree
for the most part, yes.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> But lastly, Antarctica.

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Antarctica, OK.

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Pyramids being
discovered in Antarctica.

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling this is a
huge piece of our history.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so she's nodding yes.

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And she says, this is
about to be revealed.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It has been quarantined
in a sense for a reason.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Notice it has no
dominion over it.

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It is a free-for-all
peaceful state.

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
This has been arranged for
a very special reason--

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to protect what it is that
can come about, you see.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.930 align:middle line:90%
We are very excited for this.

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, give it time, and more
and more can be revealed.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And sorry, one last thing.

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.190 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Our Inner Earth families,
our ancient civilizations

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
that may be with us here,
but sort of in hiding.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>> She says this is partially
why this area was quarantined,

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
or why it has been protected.

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.005 align:middle line:84%
This is a gateway to a
lot of those regions.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.970 align:middle line:90%


01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.758 align:middle line:90%
It has been revealed to some.

01:07:27.758 --> 01:07:31.510 align:middle line:90%


01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Some have had physical contact.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.849 align:middle line:84%
But believe this
is true, she says.

01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:41.340 align:middle line:90%


01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
She says that Corey Goode
is valid in the sense

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that there can be
physical contact made.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Believe in your hearts that
that is true, she says.

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
When you believe
and are open to it,

01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you can match up to a sooner
timeline to experience it

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
in your reality.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
It's all about belief
that brings in that--

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And welcomeness, she says.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And welcomeness, yeah.

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I do feel like
they're related somehow.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was my intuition
in asking those questions

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.560 align:middle line:90%
back to back.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.319 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask where your
lineages come from?

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, I am from
the Orion as well.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I work heavily with the
humans at this time.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.569 align:middle line:84%
They are going through
some great shifting,

01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and I help as a mediator.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I help as a translator
to help your human mind

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.330 align:middle line:90%
understand certain concepts.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:43.279 align:middle line:84%
Forgive me, for I
am trying to learn

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:47.314 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate in my
best way to the human mind,

01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
for I see things as
the larger picture,

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and you see things
as a small scope,

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to shove
the larger picture

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
into that small scope in a
way that you can understand,

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and also see the big picture.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you're
doing a great job.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.033 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:09.187 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I'm
definitely getting it.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.729 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the
people watching here

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
will better understand
this reality

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:17.280 align:middle line:90%
from sharing your perspectives.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, thank you so much,
and know that you can come

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
at any time and call upon the
Council of Light of the Highest

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.399 align:middle line:84%
Good to help your individual
souls evolve in just the same

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
as we are trying
to help collective.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.545 align:middle line:84%
We do hear what you might call a
prayer, or an intent of action,

01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:38.990 align:middle line:90%
a seeking for your own soul.

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Let us guide you into the
path that can help you

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:48.979 align:middle line:84%
and to put you into a life that
is more fulfilled, only if you

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
set the intent to
let the doors open,

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.350 align:middle line:90%
and you get to select the door.

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It is not us to tell
you which way to choose,

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
but we can give you different
ideas and avenues for you

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.600 align:middle line:90%
to choose.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
She says, this is what we
are very excited for you,

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Reuben, because this is what
essentially will be happening

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.220 align:middle line:90%
for you in this next year.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
You will have many
doors, but you

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
get to choose which
path you will take.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, she says,
could be lighter than others.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Know this.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is when
perhaps the intent would

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
be of my highest good, we
can guide you to that path.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to it all.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
It's all fun to me now that I
have this higher perspective,

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
or wider perspective to just
know whatever comes my way,

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.535 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be just right.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, one other thing
to mention for you is we are

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
hoping to place individuals in
your path that will help you

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:53.960 align:middle line:90%
make the choice accordingly.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a couple of
challenges going my way.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I'm always
up for the challenge.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:03.520 align:middle line:90%
She says, very exciting.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope we can
continue these conversations

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
in the future, and I appreciate
all the sharing, and knowledge,

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and the in-depthness
of our history.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like we're just
on the tip of the iceberg.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.970 align:middle line:84%
She actually-- when you
were talking, she picked up,

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
like visually a grain
of sand, and said,

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
we have just touched on a small
bit of basically a large part

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
of the beach.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But she says, we have outlined
the most important parts.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The details can come
later as long as you

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
understand the bigger picture--

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
oh, sorry, I just got--

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:45.110 align:middle line:90%
really spacey for a sec.

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
As long as you can
understand the bigger picture

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
behind humanity and
origins, and how it all

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
plays out into where
you're going in the future.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was actually
surprised that she came

01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
through.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I was a little bit
hoping for the reptile,

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
but didn't go in that route.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> He wasn't necessary
in this conversation.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] He was
not in the conversation.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
