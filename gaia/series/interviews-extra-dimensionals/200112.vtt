00:00:05.976 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> We are Theos.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Theos.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>> We are so honored
to speak with you,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:10%
and we have a message for you,
because we want you to know

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:10%
that your work is
very important.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
In your commitment to
do it, you will always

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:90%
find the support that you need.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
That is a universal
law that when

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
you are committed to a
higher good, which you are,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:84%
then things will continue to
flow as long as you allow them.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We want to confirm that to
you and also acknowledge

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.933 align:middle line:90%
the work you're doing.

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:39.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And the universe is grateful
in the way of you are yet

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
another being following
their truth, and for this,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
it's beautiful and
very necessary.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
heeding your call.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
the confirmation.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And it's been very--
it's very true.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:10%
I started this journey
for this particular series

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:10%
about three years ago,
and there is absolutely

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:10%
what you just said.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:10%
I've been in some
pinches and pickles,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:10%
and things have
just been flowing.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't-- it's just--
and it continues to expand.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Just every time you start
to lose your alignment,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
become appreciative
for everything,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and focus on the history of it,
how, again and again and again,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
everything goes well for you.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And that will
pull it right back.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's also your practice.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, yeah, I'm
definitely in a constant state

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:90%
of appreciation.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.856 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the way to be.

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to appreciate.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> There is.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.916 align:middle line:90%
Yes--

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all beautiful and
flowy, and with consciousness is

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:90%
bliss.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They are-- they're not possible
to exist without each other.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So they say ignorance is
bliss, but that's not true.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Consciousness is true bliss,
and as long as you're focused

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:10%
on your bliss and
your consciousness,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing that
will impede you.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:10%
It may delay you, but
then it will always

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:10%
be for the best reason.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:10%
I've-- Bruce Lee has a famous
quote about circumstances

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:10%
and opportunities, and he always
says, forget the circumstances,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:10%
and just focus on
the opportunities.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's sort of my
internal reminder of when

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:10%
I get in those pickles,
I'm like, wait.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm doing exactly--

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, out of all the
opportunities that are here,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.097 align:middle line:90%
this is what I'm doing.

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it, my calling--

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You also have to remember
that you are existing

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
in a world of many beings, who
are also having experiences.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything's coming to you
as an opportunity to learn.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So we would start our day
with whatever came to you,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and before reacting to it,
we would appreciate it just

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:90%
outright and say, thank you.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:90%
What are you here to teach me?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to learn.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if it's something,
it's only what's

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:90%
in you is reflected out of you.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So anything that comes in,
there is a part of you that

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
needs to integrate it.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So it wouldn't come
out if it wasn't there.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then but it's only
just to serve you.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So don't get caught up
in the circumstance,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.073 align:middle line:84%
but always look at the
opportunity that it offers.

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:33.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you just run
back into appreciation,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and bliss follows, and then
you're back in the flow again.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I actually had the same
conversation last night with

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:90%
my buddy.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
He was going to this event
that I was speaking at,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and I sort of texted
him at the last minute.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Hey, can you pick on my friend?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:90%
My friend needs to carpool.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was explaining to me
that the old version of him

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
used to sort of get
upset at these things,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and he felt like it was a
monkey wrench in his system,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
in his flow.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But now he realizes these
are all opportunities.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And if something
shows up like that,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
then there's something
good in there.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And he had a great
conversation, and he

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:90%
said it was in a lot of fun.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an opportunity.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you approach everything
as an exciting opportunity,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
even if you're faking
it a little bit,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
if you're just like, wow,
what is this going to bring?

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a new adventure--

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
it changes your perspective.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's-- everything is
really the perspective that you

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:90%
choose to look at everything.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And the highest perspective
is the optimal one,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
the highest perspective
of love and opportunity

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and appreciation and bliss.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no thing
higher than that.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything else has monkey
wrenches and a little bit

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of resentment and
things in them that

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
only cause other
issues that you'll have

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.845 align:middle line:90%
to deal with later as well.

00:06:57.845 --> 00:06:58.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's best to
go straight there.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
We taught Karen something,
and just for maybe

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
people who are listening, but
when something would come,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
because we are
always talking to her

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:90%
about becoming the observer.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is the goal
of mastery of yourself

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and your environment
and all the things.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we told her
to do is interje--

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
energetically, to sort of take
a deep breath and step back,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:90%
even if it's mental.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But to just, one moment, take
a step back and go, [SIGHS],,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and make the sound.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.107 align:middle line:90%
Go "huh."

00:07:32.107 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And then say, what an
interesting turn of events.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you
perspective, then,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
something has shifted.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But then you instantly
are looking at it

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to experience
it and being lost in it.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:10%
So just that little beat of
"huh," just that nanosecond

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.802 align:middle line:10%
can shift everything.

00:07:57.802 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
So it takes you out of
that knee jerk reaction.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.385 align:middle line:84%
>> That takes you
out of the knee jerk.

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Your knee jerk reaction
should be love always.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.605 align:middle line:90%
>> But until it is, take a beat.

00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that programming that
we've just been programmed to--

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It is because we are
constantly seeing ourselves

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and the unintegrated
aspects of ourselves,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
things that we haven't
worked through.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
If things inconvenience
you, you have to say, why?

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is this really
inconvenience to you?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
What was your
expectation about it?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And we know expectation
is a judgment in a way,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and it can be a tripping.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be a stumbling block.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.369 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when you are
attached to an outcome--

00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
--and that's usually
what expectation is.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're
inconvenienced, because you're

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:90%
attached to something.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:50.288 align:middle line:10%
And attachment is suffering
in the purest sense.

00:08:50.288 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:10%
Let go of the attachment.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:10%
But it's always coming up.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:10%
So things come up
that are within you.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:10%
So if it wasn't in you,
it wouldn't come up.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:10%
So-- but it's not you
being punished or--

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:10%
it's the opportunity.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:10%
The universe loves you
so much, they're saying,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:10%
hey, Reuben, guess what.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:10%
Here's a chance now to
choose something different.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And then that can
become the habit.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So you learn to observe.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
You learn to go with the flow,
and then that becomes your knee

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.837 align:middle line:90%
jerk reaction.

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
practice it sometimes.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It does take practice.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
There's that--

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And you can choose it.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:90%
You actively choose it.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The mindfulness of-- just the
awareness of being here now

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and all these things that
show up in our reality.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If you always believe that
the universe is on your side,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:90%
truly, it is.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It's only you
expressing you into--

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:90%
you know, in a larger sense.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But who would want
better for you than you?

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're going to--
unless you're sadist,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's a
different-- you know,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that's a different
thing altogether.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But you're always going
to bring yourself,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because you, as the
god source of you,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:90%
has the broader perspective.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And you see those opportunities,
so something comes,

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
and you come.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You can choose to
accept them or not.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they come back
and back and back, because you

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
will never give up on you.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And then once you face
them, they sort of dissipate?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> They can, if you choose to--

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Let them go.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> --let them go.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> If you consciously choose--

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.578 align:middle line:90%
>> You could double down.

00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> You could double down.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.507 align:middle line:90%
>> And then experience more.

00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd double down if
that's something you desire,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:90%
if that's something you can see.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, everything--

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.178 align:middle line:84%
>> But the suffering
we're talking about.

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The suffering is--

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
attachment comes
from expectation.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Attachment comes-- well,
attachment is expectation.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what we mean to say.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And nothing actually ever goes
exactly the way you think.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So-- but it can go better.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It can.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Much more of the time--

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I've noticed it
turns out better.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Why not give yourself the
opportunity to get the better?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We could say to you, OK,
if you have your expectation,

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:90%
you get this.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.037 align:middle line:84%
But if you let everything flow
and let the universe conspire

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
for everything and
let everything fall

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
into alignment, which
is its natural state,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
it's so much better.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's more exciting.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That's more--

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a fear
in the unknown.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
What is it in us humans that
find comfort in, you know,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
we want to know, we do
A, we're going to get B?

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:90%
And there's some comfort there.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And that unknown, it's so--

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the releasing,
and it's not easy to say,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:90%
it's just this.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
But you have come from such a--

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.342 align:middle line:84%
you're never
disconnected, but the--

00:11:52.342 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:90%
how do you say it?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:90%
The--

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Illusion.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --illusion of
disconnectivity is so strong,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's so strong for a reason,
because that was the game.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The game was, what if I
came into a world where I

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't know who I was or
I didn't have superpowers,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:90%
where I--

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
my creativity was delayed, my
manifestation took some time?

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and then there's
all the other circumstances

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
of the world that
have been established

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
by other beings, society,
and all these things.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.513 align:middle line:84%
And you have so many different
ways that you can come in.

00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
You're throwing
yourself in there,

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
but that is the sort of
game of the divine or source

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:90%
to come into that.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And running in like, yay,
let's go and experience it,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:10%
but when you're here,
you've forgotten.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:10%
And that's also the game.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So as you--

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:10%
as you start to awaken, which
is also the winning of the game,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:10%
really, that's part of the--
that's part of letting the go.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:10%
So you can hold on.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:10%
You can choose not to wake up,
and that experience is valid,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:10%
because that becomes a life
that chose not to wake up

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:10%
and to go through
completely blind.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is not
to judge it too much.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Everyone is where they are.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.363 align:middle line:10%
Everyone is in
the perfect place.

00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And you'll get there
when you get there.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:10%
But you will get there.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it seems right now,
humanity is kind of going

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:10%
through--

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.238 align:middle line:10%
well, there's two scenarios.

00:13:21.238 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:10%
It seems like they're
happening at the same time.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:10%
>> There's this mass evolution
when it comes to the way we do

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.803 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there's this
mass hysteria of, oh, my god,

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing's going
to go down the toilet.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is sort of this
expectations and knee jerk

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
reactions we were
just talking about

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
within our political
world, especially

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in our political world, yeah--

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.725 align:middle line:84%
>> People need the proof, so
the one thing that we can say is

00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:54.142 align:middle line:84%
the proof sometimes doesn't
come from your own experience.

00:13:54.142 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The proof comes from
the other beings

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
that are proving it true.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you an example.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
When Karen first moved
to the Netherlands,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't find
vegetarian food anywhere.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There were really little shops
that were very, very sad as far

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:90%
as what their offerings were.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But she held true to her belief
and muddled through, and now,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
within a year, seven organic
grocery stores opened right

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:90%
on her street.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
She can't find
non-organic food almost.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's just everyone--
it's the tipping point.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the hundredth monkey.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
There is a tipping point.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So the people that
are not getting it,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
we just say to the people
who are, stay the course.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Stay the course.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Stay the course.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Know that your action, know that
your intention, that your love,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that your choices
have a ripple effect.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And the highest vibration
always wins, always.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:90%
It always wins.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:10%
So the more people
that open, the more

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:10%
people that open the windows
to the light, the more light

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:10%
comes in.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And it will happen.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a process, and
the process is also exciting.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a very exciting process.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
we would say, don't

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
worry about the people
that don't get it.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But you have so
much to do yourself.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's so many
exciting opportunities right

00:15:19.302 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So clean up your
own house, really.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:10%
>> --that if we're
focused on all that,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.482 align:middle line:10%
why is it the other
person down the street,

00:15:25.482 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:10%
then we don't get to
open our own presence.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's a way
of avoidance, really,

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to be focused on what
this person's doing,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
what that person's doing.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you need to
do is what you need to do.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can be busy
with other people,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but you're not serving
yourself at all.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes
to an awareness,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and you sort of have to--

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:84%
some people don't,
but most people

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:90%
do-- they go sort of like this.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't go in a
straight line up.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.737 align:middle line:84%
They kind of go here and
there, and then they think,

00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:90%
this is what it is.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And they find out
that that doesn't--

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
no longer serves them, so
that's also the exploration.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's all OK.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.085 align:middle line:84%
It's just "stay the course"
is really the message.

00:16:07.085 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean on this path
that I've gotten to where

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm at, I--

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and, you know,
exploring, I produced

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
this political event, an
activist event, the Citizen

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Hearing, and sort of went that
path to get to where I am now.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.862 align:middle line:84%
Lot of struggles there
and a lot of things,

00:16:24.862 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
but looking back at
it now, I'm like, oh,

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that was all part of
my necessary growth.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the perception of the
people that took place in that,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.752 align:middle line:90%
and we were aware of that work.

00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And Karen actually
did watch it, and that

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:90%
was the truth for them.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
knowledge that they had,

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and their experiential
thing was that.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So that, in that
moment, is valid.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.105 align:middle line:84%
>> And for me, at the time, too,
yeah, that was my exploration.

00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing
wrong with it.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, whatever
triggers, there's

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
always somebody that
will do it better.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
There's always
someone who will say--

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
for instance, Karen wants to
eat that Impossible Burger.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this Impossible
Burger is the 1,000th,

00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:90%
100,000th version of a burger.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
Someone-- when she first
became a vegetarian,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:90%
she was eating cardboard stuff.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Like black beans
and cardboard.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Pretty much.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And she enjoyed it, because
it was in her alignment.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.789 align:middle line:10%
But wow, what a
difference a decade makes.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there's something
else that we talked to Karen

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.630 align:middle line:84%
about, and we'll talk
to you about it as well,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
because we think it'll
give you some perspective.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not always the end
goal that you will achieve

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in your journey.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:90%
But the eye is on the prize.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But all the steps between
there, where you begin,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and where you end
up are important.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about the Great
Wall of China as an example.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.218 align:middle line:84%
The person that
conceived of that wall

00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people
that conceived of the wall

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
never saw its fruition.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah, it took
hundreds of years to build.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> They never saw it.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But for thousands--
a thousand years,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
the space was held for the
manifestation of that wall.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine?

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.747 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
as your journey.

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to know why
you're doing something,

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:90%
what's your intention.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That intention will
come into fruition.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It may not happen
in your lifetime.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:90%
It may not happen in--

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, but we don't want
to set up false expectations.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But what we want to
say is that the journey

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
to get there, the commitment
to get there is important.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything that comes is built
on the shoulders of everything

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that came before it.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So be happy to be part of
the revolution, really.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
true with everything.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Gay marriage--
many of the people

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
who fought for their right
never lived to see it,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:90%
but their fight was important.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:57.168 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and now you're
going to have children born

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
into a world where
it's just normal.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> What a gift.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
with this work.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And so years ago,
Karen understood that,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:10%
and she just said, I'm
happy to do my part.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:10%
My job is to serve.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Whatever the outcome
is, I'm going to serve.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:10%
Now what would--
what would you say--

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:10%
because I've sort of
been back and forth

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:10%
on these ideas and concepts.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:10%
And at first, I was sort of,
again, wore the advocate hat.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:10%
I was a UFO activist.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:10%
You know, I got a write-up
in "Newsweek" last month

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:10%
with that old title.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't consider myself
the activist anymore.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:10%
But I would march
against Monsanto

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:10%
in these anti-GMO marches,
Occupy Wall Street.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:10%
These are all things
that, you know,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I was in my sort of, we've got
to do the right thing, mode.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I did all that, and then now,
I'm sort of looking at it.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a lot.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm too tired.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that now.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And now we have enough
organic choices at the store.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't need to
fight anymore to do this.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I just simply buy
the organic food.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's always this
sort of division on what

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
people, say don't push against.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't activate.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't necessarily agree
with that, and we'll say why.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the fire of motivation,
the desire for something

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
more needs to be stated
to go into reality.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you're in a situation
where nobody's listening,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you can sometimes get
caught up in the fire of it.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a little
bit of a mistake,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a mistake.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very necessary.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you think about
civil rights movement--

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:90%
That was another--

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you didn't
fight, if you didn't--

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But that was the
passion of the people.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So if that's your passion,
if that's your greatest joy,

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
if you feel like you're in a
world where you cannot live

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
for one more moment when
something is like this,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
then march.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:10%
Save the animals.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Do it, you know?

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if it does have
that conflicting, you know,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:90%
fighting resistance type--

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if we're
here, as an example,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.750 align:middle line:84%
as a vegetarian or vegan person,
and right there is an animal,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and you can save that animal,
are you going to walk away,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
want to push against?

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Like you said, it would be my
highest excitement to do that.

00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Be your highest excitement,
and that is what true passion

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
That is what living
your truth is.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.042 align:middle line:10%
Your truth can evolve into--

00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:10%
you know, there's
a foundation that

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:10%
can be laid so that those
actions are not necessary.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
the thing to do.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And we never want to say
to someone, do not follow

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:90%
your greatest excitement.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Do not stand.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, the person
in, we believe

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
it's China, who went and
put the flower in the tank,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:90%
it changed the world.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:10%
So there are moments when, if
you are in your flow state,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and that is what you're
motivated to do, then do it.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We want you to experience
the power that you

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:90%
have as a creative being.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
You might be presenting
in a way that person that

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
put that flower was
bringing a new idea.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's never--

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Abraham says this, and we're
going to borrow the phrase,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
but they say there's never
a crowd on the leading

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:90%
edge of thought.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:10%
The visionary is usually
told it's not possible.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:10%
It's not true.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:10%
It shouldn't happen.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And then everybody
gets on board eventually.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Then there's seven
organic shops on your street.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> But--

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>> The world is not flat.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's round.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But yet today, we've
sort of gone back,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and we have some people
who believe that.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you have people who--

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:10%
they get caught up in wanting
to do everything right.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:90%
There's not right or wrong.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Let go of that.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Let go of what's my passion.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:10%
My passion is to show
love to this being.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that involves
breaking a law.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
The laws maybe
weren't made in love,

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
but what's an
alignment of real love?

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe sometimes things
are worth fighting for.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:10%
And we know that other beings
don't, but we personally feel

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that this is not to ever be--

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:10%
we would never want to curb
humanity's drive for love

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:10%
and beauty.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always love
to turn the other cheek

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:90%
or to turn away.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's more
love to stand up.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So following your passion,
and when it is in your highest

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
excitement, to stand up and
march against Monsanto or fight

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:90%
for civil rights or--

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe not-- "fight" is
maybe not the best word.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:10%
Maybe speak your truth about it.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Speak your truth.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But in some time,
in some situations,

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:90%
conflicts come out of that--

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Occupy Wall Street, or
I should say, riots.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we would say
non-violence is the best way

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:90%
to to.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Standing Rock, I
thought, was an amazingly--

00:24:37.445 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
an amazing example of
how to have that energy.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I did go to Standing Rock,
and I was part of that.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And even though I had already
adopted these new philosophies

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and ways, but I felt the
energy of Standing Rock

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
was different than
the March of Monsanto.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe you were
different in that experience.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I definitely was
different, but--

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You were
different, and again,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
these experiences come up.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
They are wanted.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:90%
All experience is wanted.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:90%
So really accept that.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Really accept it, if you can.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
We suggested we don't, but
all experience is wanted.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
We will tell you we have
it on good authority.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that experience
of you doing what you did

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward and
now seeing a different way

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is also part of
your progression.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have the
hindsight to say, well,

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe I could have done
it a little differently.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But that wouldn't have come
if someone just told you.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it would have,
but we don't think so.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:90%
We think you would have--

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
you needed to experience it,
because there is a part of you

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%
that wanted to express.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to express.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you were
propagating violence,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're propagating this,
then that's definitely

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:90%
not the right way to do it.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really
standing, you know,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
there are things that
are worth fighting for,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and they're worth dying for.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
If someone comes now, and you
have your beautiful spouse

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
there, are you
going to hesitate?

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course not.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And no one would expect it.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:10%
And we would be
disappointed if you did.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Things are worth--
but know your battles.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Choose them.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Some things are
worth fighting for.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Some things are worth
standing up for.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Right is right.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:90%
You have to say that.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
out and tear down.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:10%
That's the difference
is that you

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:10%
have the people from Monsanto,
and they are refusing to alter.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they have
doubled down on their--

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
so what's happened?

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:90%
People stood up.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And at the same time, it
gave people the space to create

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:90%
something new.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And people were just
choosing the new thing,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't have
to destroy Monsanto.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:90%
But then it's like that.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So if no one had brought
to the people's awareness

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
of the things that were going
on, nothing would have changed,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
would it?

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you don't
know, you don't know.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:18.585 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're sort of
having that evolution

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
now with oil and electricity.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had Elon Musk bring in
the Tesla electric revolution,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.483 align:middle line:84%
which has sort of opened
the world's eyes to, oh,

00:27:33.483 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:90%
we can do it this way.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's, again-- now
what's the hundredth version

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:90%
of this Tesla car going to be?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's going to be amazing.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.912 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be
breathtaking, you know?

00:27:40.912 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:90%
And the same with everything--

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
the initial idea, the awareness
sparks the creativity.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Necessity breeds change, but if
you don't know, you don't know.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:10%
When Karen was 19, and she
was driving home from her job,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:10%
she was just driving.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.393 align:middle line:10%
And she just heard, "slow down."

00:28:07.393 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was coming
up on a bridge,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.735 align:middle line:84%
and she was about to go
around the curve of the exit.

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:10%
And as she came
around the curve,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:10%
there was a large median there.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:10%
And so she heard, slow down,
and she just thought, OK.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
why am I slowing down?

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And then she heard, just slow
down to five miles an hour,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:90%
which is a weird thing to hear.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't question it,
because the voice was just

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:90%
so gentle.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And she thought, OK.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then she heard, just pull
over in the median and stop.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:90%
So she said, OK.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that very moment,
coming the wrong way

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
down the intersection or down
the-- excuse me-- offramp

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
was a car being
chased by a police car

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
at a very high speed.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And in that very exact
moment, she pulled over.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, whoa,
well, that's interesting.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And then she drove home.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But just recently, we informed
her that that was her.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:90%
That was-- that was her.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
That was an
extra-dimensional her

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that came back to
her to save her.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people think,
oh, it's my guardian angels,

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
we would challenge
you to say, no,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:84%
it's you coming to you
at the right moment.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we're telling
you is that you

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
have the power to change your
past, present, and future.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to intend
not only now, but in the past

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and in the future.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.262 align:middle line:84%
And if there's something
that you want to change,

00:29:39.262 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
but you're not necessarily
able to directly affect it,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.020 align:middle line:84%
you can use your
intention to mentally go

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
there to-- in your meditation,
and change anything.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:10%
So they say in Hinduism that
as a soul becomes awakened,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:10%
that their ancestors rejoice,
because as they awaken,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:10%
they change their past.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:90%
They change their future.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But they also can fix the karma
of their entire family line

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
or humanity, even.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And so that will come from you.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And you, as humans, don't
realize how strong intention is

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:90%
and how far reaching it is.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:10%
It is not just
applicable to you,

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.100 align:middle line:10%
because people sit
and do affirmations--

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:10%
oh, give me a car.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:10%
Give me this.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:10%
But you can affirm everything.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you really know that
you're a creative being,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:90%
if you really know it, use it.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You have the technology,
we would say.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:90%
You have the tools.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It's only lack of
bigger thinking that

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:90%
doesn't propel you to do that.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to affect as
much as you can with love.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Send it as many places
as you feel inspired.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:90%
You see something, intend.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:90%
See something, intend.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:90%
See something, intend.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:90%
That ripple, that wave, it goes.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It may be the
concept of the wall.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the Great Wall?

00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It might be the
concept of the Great Wall.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It will land.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It will manifest.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
be attached to win.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
be attached to how.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Trust that the universe
is just waiting for you

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.510 align:middle line:90%
to tell it what you want.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, and
that's definitely--

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
with the state I'm
playing in these days.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I remember--

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's for everyone.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> --there was so much
attachment to the Citizen

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Hearing.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is it.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.488 align:middle line:90%
This is going to break.

00:31:38.488 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This is going to push disclosure
and have all of that happen.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And when it didn't happen
in that way I expected it,

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and the media
didn't quite grab it

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the way I had
expected it to, there

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:84%
was a bit of a downer
moment of like, OK.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But-- and that's when I sort of
gravitated to this information

00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Stay the course,
we would say.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no overnight sensations.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:90%
No, and I've learned--

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true for everything.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.163 align:middle line:84%
>> I've learned that
lesson, you know.

00:32:07.163 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In this world, if instant
manifestation was possible

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
here, everything would
be cleaned up and done.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it would
have already happened.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to appreciate the
experience that we're having

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and just say, well,
OK, I put it out there.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I trust it.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
As you commit
yourself to service,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a non-egoic thing.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But the ego is having to
learn that it's not going

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:90%
to die if you do something.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So all of those fight
or flight stimulations

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
come, because all
the scenarios--

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you
walk, and you see

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.070 align:middle line:84%
a snake that has the
wrong shape head,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of you that
knows to move away quickly

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:90%
or avoid it.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Those things are necessary.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But as a human, part of our
job is to learn to master that.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So everyone's not perfect.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.422 align:middle line:84%
Jesus even doubted his
mission at one moment.

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:90%
He thought, what's happening?

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.710 align:middle line:90%
They're killing me.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And how is this possible?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.382 align:middle line:90%
I did everything you said to do.

00:33:18.382 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know this, but we're
going to teach it to you

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
anyway, because we
think you want--

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:84%
we want to give you this,
because we want you,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
in the moments where you
doubt, things to come up,

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to become your mantra,
that nothing that is real

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:84%
can be threatened, and
nothing that is unreal exists.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.110 align:middle line:90%
You're never in any real danger.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes things go
in a way you don't expect.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's not the
outcome on the initial scene

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:90%
is, does it look the best?

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So we don't see
you in any danger.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.370 align:middle line:90%
We're not trying to say that.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But the commitment to
it is what's important,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the commitment to the
service above everything,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're serving it, that you
know that if you are expressing

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
yourself in the
fullness of who you are,

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
to look past that.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't look at the outcome.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The outcome-- you have to know
that your intention will--

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:90%
we're saying "land."

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.179 align:middle line:90%
It will manifest.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It will manifest.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Then, when-- so
I was going to say,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not an
egoic thing but to--

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But then we want
to say something.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
The intention of
the manifestation

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be how it occurs.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.120 align:middle line:90%
The intention should be love.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:90%
The intention should be peace.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The intention should be joy
and bliss and well-being.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the intention, and
you're working in the way

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
that you feel inspired
to work towards that.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So all the other-- there should
be no attachment of oh, well,

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it didn't exactly happen the
way I thought or these people--

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
because the intention is
for the greater good of you,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:90%
of humanity, and the world.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the intention.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So the success is--
that's success.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Success is how much do you love?

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:90%
How happy are you?

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
How much bliss do
you experience?

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the true success.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The other things are
irrelevant, completely.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I agree, but it's still,
when they are three years down

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the road after
getting on this path,

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.868 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sort of putting things
out and just doing my thing,

00:35:33.868 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's financially
not a big success.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
school of life.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.075 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's fine.

00:35:40.075 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm still having fun.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.533 align:middle line:84%
I'm being supported
in all these ways.

00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no but.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You don't say, "but I'm having."

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I am having a good time.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am
having a good time.

00:35:48.285 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Full stop.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am--

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And be your improv coach.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --being supported in
every way, in every aspect.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Repeat that over and over.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's--

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And get excited in that.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Marvel in that.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's such a
beautiful thing to witness.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And when--

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You learn quickly.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --people three years
later come to me at an event

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.910 align:middle line:84%
or something, out of the blue,
and say thank you for doing

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:90%
this work.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.340 align:middle line:84%
With this, I've done
this and this and this.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.798 align:middle line:84%
And then, I guess,
that's where I'm

00:36:19.798 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to say is that
I do get a warm fuzzy.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And is that the ego
getting the warm fuzzy?

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's the appreciation.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.885 align:middle line:90%
Thank them as well.

00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's not
my ego getting--

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No, unless you start to
have an attitude about it.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It's how I react to that,
other than the warm fuzzy.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, oh, that's cool.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.427 align:middle line:84%
And I do-- I'm very
appreciative that somebody

00:36:40.427 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:90%
resonated with this stuff.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You can say, well, it's been
amazing that we could co-create

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%
this together.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing
experience, and thank you

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.940 align:middle line:84%
for following your
bliss to watch it.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And again, thank you--

00:36:54.690 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:84%
thank you universe for this
unexpected boon of joy for me,

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
just one more amazing
piece of joy for me.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> If you start to believe
that I am the second coming

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of everything, and, well,
I did this-- and yes.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the ego.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.112 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the ego
getting in the way.

00:37:12.112 --> 00:37:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the ego.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
intention of change

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
has to be an intention for
the greater good of something,

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
not that there's going to
be an organic grocery store.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.602 align:middle line:84%
That's the result. That
is the unexpected result,

00:37:28.602 --> 00:37:30.310 align:middle line:84%
because there might
come something that's

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.700 align:middle line:84%
even better than a grocery store
or something even different,

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:90%
or who knows?

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:90%
But the intention is for change.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The intention is that people
will thrive on organic food.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.322 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to focus my support
on propagating that economy.

00:37:50.322 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we got
the Impossible Burger.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Then the Impossible
Burger shows up.

00:37:54.243 --> 00:37:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Who could have
imagined such a thing?

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, someone did.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone did, and they
brought it to the world.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> They brought it in,
because it was impossible.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Humans love
impossible situations.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other one--
the Beyond Burger, right?

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:90%
So we have the Beyond--

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I was joking the other day that
it's beyond another dimension

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's--

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you guys might
get a kick out of this.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:27.235 align:middle line:84%
I was joking with Eureka, my
wife, about the Beyond Burger

00:38:27.235 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and the Impossible Burger--

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:90%
they're angel food.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.500 align:middle line:84%
It's angel food, because angels
would never kill an animal.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And they would never
harm and have meat.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't know
what it tasted like.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So they sent the humans in to go
in and live in these densities

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and then to expand and
evolve and to bring back

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:84%
the taste of meat in harmless
way of developing something.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And then now, the
angels can eat this.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we think that that's
a beautiful story, and why not?

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.868 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of wanted
to get into--

00:39:07.868 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are we and where are we?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we're kind of--

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, part of
my show is sort

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of finding a classification and
putting labels, and I know--

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:84%
just to help people
sort of get an idea,

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not exact but
just roughly about densities.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with the
density classifications?

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't exist
within any density.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:90%
We are everywhere and nowhere.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:90%
We are not physical.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:90%
We have not incarnated.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:90%
We are not incarnated.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Karen used to say that we were
an aspect of her higher self.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we corrected her to
say that she is, in fact,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:90%
our projection into humanity.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And we are three
energies of her over soul

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:90%
that are aware of each other.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this place, where we are,
which is not a nonlocal place,

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
but for lack of a better
terminology, we exist.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
experience is through focus.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So we can be an orange for
a day to experience that.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We can go through the
life span of that.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We can focus our focus on
any experience that we want.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So an already
existing consciousness--

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.900 align:middle line:84%
would you merge with
that consciousness?

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Or would you make a copy of it?

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>> We would be it.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You would be it.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.875 align:middle line:84%
>> We would be, because we are
everything, as you are, also,

00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:90%
on the highest perspective.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And so we will be a tree.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:90%
We are trees, many times.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And that is just what we do.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But we also are incarnated
in human form and other forms

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.680 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we're multidimensional,
and we are infinite,

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.290 align:middle line:90%
as you are infinite.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So Karen is only one
projection of us.

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are, of course,
that projection of source.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're not so far
from the origin point,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:84%
so we have a very
high ability to see

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:90%
things in a very broad way.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the need to
really identify with any race

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
or to really talk too much
about what's happening in sort

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:90%
of the heavens and the space.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's very interesting
to see and the beings

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that are us doing that,
they're very busy with that.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But as we are Karen now,
we are connected to her,

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
because her consciousness
has a through line to us.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what's coming through
is that through line.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:84%
She is connected and we
are speaking through her.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And she's having
her own experiences

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and evolving as a
soul and growing.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that we reached out

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to her is because of her
wanting, the part of her that

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.220 align:middle line:84%
came into this world and
that was, we would say,

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:84%
a little bit by design, came
into this world understanding

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that that connection
was possible.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But you have to also
understand that she

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
went through an entire
lifetime knowing that.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But there was only a
certain time within humanity

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:84%
where it was appropriate
to bring that forward.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So people have asked us before,
were you always channeling?

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Were you always sharing?

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Not in this way, because at
that time, it wasn't the time.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't for
the benefit of all.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.642 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't-- it was--

00:42:38.642 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:84%
well, the benefit
of all is always,

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:45.020 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't necessary
in that moment.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, the world is calling
out, just as she called out.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're happy to share, to give
just another perspective of who

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So when Karen decided
to channel Theos,

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and you guys decided to
come through in this form

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and fashion, was it more it was
like Karen's six-year-old self

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.490 align:middle line:84%
saying, hey, I want
to talk to you guys?

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk to God.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk to God.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And is that the collective?

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll
explain something.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is like
a tree, you know?

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
You have the tree, and it's
nice that we have the tree here.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.495 align:middle line:84%
You have the tree
that's on the ground.

00:43:20.495 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:90%
And we've said this many times.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You have the tree
that's on the ground.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the ground.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath, you
have the root system.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We're the root system that
is plugged into source.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's all one tree.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:33.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:84%
There's only this illusion
of the separation.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:84%
She is us, manifest
in this world.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And just like trees,
there are several trees

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that can come from a
certain root system--

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the root system being
all of everything.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Would this be similar--

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I've heard through other
channelings and information

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:03.527 align:middle line:84%
that the Christ consciousness
manifested Jesus, the body,

00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:04.985 align:middle line:84%
because of the
calling at the time.

00:44:04.985 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, and
that's true of--

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
because Karen is more
in line with Hindu

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
thought, but that is also a
very strong prevalent Krishna

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:84%
conciousness or
Shiva consciousness.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But there is a time in humanity
where they call out so strong,

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.470 align:middle line:84%
also in a time of
great darkness,

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:29.810 align:middle line:84%
where it's just become
enough already, you know?

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.070 align:middle line:90%
It's just enough.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason
that we come here,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:39.050 align:middle line:84%
truly, the true
reason is the joy.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And so it can go really--

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to say wrong.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It can just really
go the other way,

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you just need a
little bit of a helping hand.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And the calling
is there, so yes.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And especially in this time
of transition with humanity.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But now the calling's become
great and many have come.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, oh, yeah.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.260 align:middle line:90%
We have many.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There's always been
many before, true.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:84%
In different societies and
different things, they've come,

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.170 align:middle line:84%
but now, it's coming in a
little bit of a different way.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> We will say that--

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to
Karen's higher self.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.750 align:middle line:84%
She has also asked
us about this,

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and we confirmed that
it's also possible

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.430 align:middle line:84%
that if she had been a
child living in India

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and had this great God
focus or divine focus--

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to turn
people off with the word "God,"

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:84%
but for lack of a
better term, she'd

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.078 align:middle line:90%
always been interested in that.

00:45:34.078 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:84%
If that had been the case and
she was in a different country,

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.140 align:middle line:84%
like India, she would have
been very quickly sent off

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to an ashram to study and
learn at the feet of a guru who

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.220 align:middle line:90%
was fully realized.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And a fully realized guru
is no longer channeling.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:53.700 align:middle line:84%
They are their divine self
manifest in human form.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So because that was not
the possibility and also,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe not the possibility
of many in humanity,

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:90%
the calling didn't change.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there's the
part of you that

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.950 align:middle line:90%
is sort of your inner guru.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We could say we are the
inner guru of Karen,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and we have come
forward to teach her

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.930 align:middle line:84%
what she may have learned
there in that way.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And using the
mechanism of channeling--

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the mechanism
of channeling.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Using, I sort of
mentioned this last night,

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.340 align:middle line:90%
sort of a permission slip to--

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We liked that, what you
said, because that's very true.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.675 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's because you are--

00:46:30.675 --> 00:46:31.475 align:middle line:90%
we are her.

00:46:31.475 --> 00:46:32.700 align:middle line:90%
She is us.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation between
you and I or your wife and you.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.670 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation, really.

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But, as we said, in the
descending part of coming in--

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, creation is
just a rolling breath.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an inhale and an exhale
that's continual and forever.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So in this exhale, the
Divine, who remains intact,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:84%
who's created a vacuum within
itself, as the breath is

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:06.250 align:middle line:84%
breathed out, this
divine consciousness

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that is everything and
undifferentiated from anything

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:84%
has created a
vacuum within itself

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and expelling itself through
its breath, through the sound,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:90%
through the Om sound.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.710 align:middle line:84%
That all of the things
that are what humanity

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:84%
has kind of come
on, like add-ons,

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:84%
like an onion, layers, as
opposed to peeling away

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the layers, which happens
when you start to wake up.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Picture it going in reverse.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So as you come through,
down through the heavens

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.430 align:middle line:84%
or the spheres, you have more
aware beings, less aware,

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:84%
less aware, less aware,
don't know anything.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So as you start to come up,
those things start to come off.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So you run into the world as a
being, and you come in knowing,

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.940 align:middle line:90%
and then you don't know anymore.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's changing as well,
because the calling out

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:01.630 align:middle line:90%
is so strong.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:06.060 align:middle line:84%
You have children now that
are being born so aware.

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's a progression too.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:90%
That is the plan of humanity.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in a maze and
trying to find the other end.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:18.992 align:middle line:84%
So all of humanity is conspiring
together to get to this maze,

00:48:18.992 --> 00:48:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is just the
natural progression of it.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a story in Detroit
of communities building

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:90%
their own internet and--

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they didn't have it.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, things that are given
easily are not appreciated.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:37.750 align:middle line:84%
They aren't, because
the thriving to achieve

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:90%
is in-built in humans.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:84%
They want to have that
accomplishment that

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.350 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
commitment to the goal

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:84%
without really having a knowing
if it's going to work or not.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But you know it,
that you believe it,

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.670 align:middle line:90%
so you're going to go for it.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And if you succeed, you succeed.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.817 align:middle line:84%
If you fail, you fail
big, but you tried.

00:49:04.817 --> 00:49:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and when it's sort
of handed to you on a silver

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.317 align:middle line:84%
platter, then you have
these expectations.

00:49:09.317 --> 00:49:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you should be
this way, and then

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.200 align:middle line:84%
when that sort of is
taken away from you--

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Champion what is
a good as a human.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Champion what is good.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Encourage just by-- it
can be writing a letter

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:23.150 align:middle line:90%
or sending an intention.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But champion those
things so that the focus

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:84%
on the goodness of it, the
wonderful of it, it grows.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And the other stuff, just
don't worry about it so much,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:84%
unless it becomes
something burning for you.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But you have limited
time, so pick what's

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:90%
really, really important.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We want you all to
overcome everything.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:90%
We know you can do it.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.460 align:middle line:90%
We're invested in it.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:58.463 align:middle line:84%
So we only want you to
follow that passion, really.

00:49:58.463 --> 00:50:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you agree
with this statement--

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:03.040 align:middle line:84%
it's better to fight for
something than to fight against

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:90%
something?

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and yes,
very much so, yes.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And we would say,
maybe, not fight.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, again, that
word has a lot of weight.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but if you use
the word "fighting"

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to mean to hold onto
the truth of that,

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:26.260 align:middle line:84%
regardless of circumstance,
that that is your truth,

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and that you're going to put
your energy into that above

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.660 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As opposed to try to tear
down other people's truths.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> To tear down anything.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Or tear down
anything, exactly, yeah.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the thing is, is
if something-- you can say,

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:48.790 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if there's a
fire, you want to put it out.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But even the firemen, at
times, say, we can't save it.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.865 align:middle line:90%
We just have to let it burn.

00:50:54.865 --> 00:50:56.830 align:middle line:84%
That's a fine line,
and that's something

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:90%
you will learn in experience.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So do what feels, again,
your highest truth,

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:90%
your highest passion.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:11.833 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're really
your true self, you know?

00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of fire, we've had a
lot of fires here in California

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.870 align:middle line:90%
lately.

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Is this just part
of the process?

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of the growth
we're going through?

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we wouldn't put
so much judgment on it,

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.900 align:middle line:90%
but fire is cleansing.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So take that for what it is.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> A natural process.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Fire can be stimulating.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It's also energy.

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It's motivation, but
it can also be anger.

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is a culmination of
things that do have a result.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:48.130 align:middle line:84%
If you light a plant on, the
fire is just being what it is,

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:50.330 align:middle line:90%
but the fire also will expand.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to
know that there's

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:59.390 align:middle line:84%
no mistakes, whether it was
intentional or unintentional.

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It occurred, and it
occurred with results.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, what do
you do about it now?

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you choose now?

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The choice is always how
can I integrate this?

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.650 align:middle line:90%
How can I love more?

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about blaming.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Though, you will have--

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:84%
you do have a spectrum of
people within your society,

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.590 align:middle line:84%
whose job it is to look for
the perpetrators of something,

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Let those guys handle that.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Excuse us?

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Let those guys handle that.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Let them handle that.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.180 align:middle line:90%
You work on you.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there's people who
are at different levels,

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and you can always
trust that all the-- how

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:46.920 align:middle line:84%
do we say-- loose ends
get picked up by somebody,

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.975 align:middle line:84%
because that is, in that moment,
their sort of job or role.

00:52:50.975 --> 00:52:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And their passion, yeah.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and their--

00:52:52.933 --> 00:52:55.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe not their passion
but maybe their role.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing you can ever
do is work on yourself, ever.

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all you can ever do.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So in every moment,
And it's not--

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:06.210 align:middle line:84%
again, the whys
can become a trap.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So the intention of what you
do want is the biggest thing.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a really hard thing
to let go of, because you

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:90%
live in your own universe.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're here
sitting with you now,

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.560 align:middle line:84%
we're two universes bumping
up against each other,

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're here to tell you that
that universe that you're in,

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that looks like we're sharing
it, is you expressing you.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing you can ever
really do is work on you, ever.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you really,
really understand

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that, you may live in a universe
where there's no more fires.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But another person has a
totally different experience,

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find
that more and more

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.310 align:middle line:84%
as you become more conscious,
more multidimensional things

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:57.080 align:middle line:84%
will start to occur side by
side that seem unexplainable.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and instead of
getting caught up with trying

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to explain it, just
ask yourself, OK,

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.390 align:middle line:90%
what do I do from here?

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, always.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:90%
What do I do now?

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.083 align:middle line:90%
>> What do I do now?

00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What do I choose?

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Choose love.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Love, love, knee jerk reaction.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.930 align:middle line:90%
And if it isn't, practice it.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Practice it by appreciating
until you get to the love.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Find it.

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Make that your goal.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Seek it out.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Hunt it down.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Stalk it a little bit.

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Stalk the love.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.493 align:middle line:84%
>> You say that
light-heartedly, but truly.

00:54:33.493 --> 00:54:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the hard thing,
because there's always the but.

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:36.710 align:middle line:90%
But what if?

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But-- the formula
is what we said.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.150 align:middle line:90%
This is the alchemical formula.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.950 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It's simple, so, so simple.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Hard, until it's habit, until
it's so just who you are.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But we will say, probably,
you have a lifetime

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.442 align:middle line:90%
of opportunities to practice.

00:55:07.442 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Not that you won't get there.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.372 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you will.

00:55:10.372 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people get there sooner.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't get there.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> They get to come--

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But they get the
chance to practice again.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.987 align:middle line:84%
>> You get to come
back and do it again.

00:55:17.987 --> 00:55:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, here or somewhere else.

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We just want to give
you an example of action

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.130 align:middle line:90%
that may not look like--

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.120 align:middle line:84%
we may be a little bit
pushing against or seem it,

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.300 align:middle line:84%
but its intention was
the most important thing.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a man who
had a cattle farm,

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:41.285 align:middle line:84%
and he sold his cattle
every season to the butcher

00:55:41.285 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:90%
to be sold.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And his wife became a vegan.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.760 align:middle line:84%
She had an experience that
changed her, because she

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.710 align:middle line:90%
connected with the cows.

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:52.520 align:middle line:90%
She made friends with them.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And she started to notice
that they were beings that

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.640 align:middle line:90%
have feelings and experience.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And she decided that she didn't
want to have this anymore.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And her husband had a business.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
might be vegan, but--

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my job.

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:11.180 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my job.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And so she told him, fine,
he could sell the cows,

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.350 align:middle line:84%
but sell them to
her, because she

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:90%
was going to start a sanctuary.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And she told him if
he did sell the cows,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.810 align:middle line:84%
then she would use his credit
cards to get them back.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So she put him in an
impossible situation,

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:84%
because he knew she
was really serious.

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so he finally relented,
because it became a point of,

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.350 align:middle line:84%
if you don't do this,
I'm leaving you.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, well, what is it
you see in these cows, anyway?

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And she took him around,
and he experienced

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:54.090 align:middle line:84%
what she had experienced,
and it changed him.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:58.190 align:middle line:84%
He had this realization,
and it came through,

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.020 align:middle line:90%
pushing a little bit.

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.570 align:middle line:84%
It came through fighting and
yelling, threatening a little.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of a checkmate
game, too, of chess.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> His wife was
very smart in it,

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.410 align:middle line:90%
but she stood by her conviction.

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
right one, you know?

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.508 align:middle line:84%
Again, we will probably
get some pushback of people

00:57:17.508 --> 00:57:18.800 align:middle line:90%
who say, well, it's your right.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And we say, OK, it's your right,
but what do you choose to do?

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this choice,
he was transformed.

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, well, when
you say "right,"

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.410 align:middle line:84%
you mean sort of
higher vibration.

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Higher vibration of--

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.288 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything
that you take in

00:57:34.288 --> 00:57:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
you create in your life

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:41.150 align:middle line:84%
has a vibration of
love or not love.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
love is to serve

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:47.000 align:middle line:84%
these animals, who have
come into your care,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to give them, in a way,
the best life possible.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So by not doing that, you are,
in fact, not serving them.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.860 align:middle line:84%
In the end, they're
not really hurt,

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.530 align:middle line:84%
because they're just energy
and all of that stuff

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that we all know.

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, in this
world, it's about moving

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:90%
from darkness to light.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was
just going to say,

00:58:07.695 --> 00:58:09.830 align:middle line:84%
we're sort of evolving from
the start to the light.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.470 align:middle line:10%
So that's why--

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:10%
I guess if we were going
the other direction, then

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.630 align:middle line:10%
maybe if we were doing
instead of taking--

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:22.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you're going in
time where you do have peoples,

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.410 align:middle line:10%
they don't have
a lot of choices.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Here, in this country, in many
countries in the Western world,

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and even countries of
the non-Western world,

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:34.280 align:middle line:90%
there's many choices.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.080 align:middle line:90%
You have a luxury of choices.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So what do you choose when
you have all the power?

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:47.210 align:middle line:84%
That says more about you
than the choice itself.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:51.168 align:middle line:84%
It's a different story
when you have no choice.

00:58:51.168 --> 00:58:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a totally different story.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a totally different time.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.017 align:middle line:84%
Most people, the
majority of people,

00:58:58.017 --> 00:59:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and there are a great deal
that aren't, but the majority

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:03.300 align:middle line:90%
of people have this choice.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.760 align:middle line:90%
So what do you choose?

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Who do you want to be?

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.150 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to
walk in the world?

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.430 align:middle line:84%
What kind of world do
you want to create?

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Violence propagates violence.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Love propagates love.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And so what do you want?

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you really want?

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to bring
that example to you

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:24.050 align:middle line:84%
about this woman who maybe
fought for something she really

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:24.850 align:middle line:90%
believed.

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's a
beautiful story.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we didn't
do it, but we saw it.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.770 align:middle line:10%
And she did it, and
she accomplished it.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And now they have a
sanctuary right in the middle

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.360 align:middle line:90%
of Texas cattle country.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Excellent, and I think more
of these stories are going

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:40.700 align:middle line:90%
to start popping up.

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> More, more-- the way Karen
became a vegetarian is she was

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.720 align:middle line:84%
in arts festival,
where they had--

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:90%
wildlife festival.

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
eagle on a pedestal.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle had a damaged wing
and had been shot by a hunter.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And she happened to be around
13, and she was walking by.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at the eagle,
and that eagle looked at her.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And she went home, and
she said to her mother,

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm never eating meat again.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, she didn't know what
vegetarian was, even,

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but that connection of
realizing that being

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
had a consciousness,
that it knew

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and understood what
had happened to it.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't oblivious.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, our plants
aren't oblivious, either.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, but, but--

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.075 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an evolution.

01:00:26.075 --> 01:00:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's and evolution, yeah.

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:28.935 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're ready to
live on light, you will.

01:00:28.935 --> 01:00:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, almost there.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The next step.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The next step--
breath and light.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Breath and light,
if it's necessary.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.650 align:middle line:90%
It may or may not be necessary.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.630 align:middle line:90%
If it's your highest joy.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But those Beyond
Burgers taste really good.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
thank you, Theos--

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --for sharing your wisdom and
for sharing and coming through

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Karen in this way.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We just want to say to everyone
that you have the ability

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
larger part of you.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
You come equipped
with that ability.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty exciting.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.650 align:middle line:90%
You're ready.

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.672 align:middle line:90%
So if you want to--

01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a matter of
just going inside.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And it is inside.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside of you.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.310 align:middle line:90%
No one can do it for you.

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:15.610 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
go in, but we would

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
encourage you to
take a look in there,

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:19.960 align:middle line:90%
because there's a lot going on.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And the universe is there.

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And we will say one
last thing to you.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.960 align:middle line:84%
We say this a lot, but we
want you to experience it,

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
because we know you understand.

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you close your eyes
for a moment, and just

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
realize that you are standing
in the perfect mind of God.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
In this moment that
you are everything

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.770 align:middle line:90%
that the divine had in mind.

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
You are perfect.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And you are only just
part of all it is,

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but you're the
unique proposition

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.740 align:middle line:90%
that can only be who you are.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is perfect
and that is wanted.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So celebrate your uniqueness,
and celebrate your ability

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to experience and choose
to experience what

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.582 align:middle line:90%
will bring you the most joy.

01:02:11.582 --> 01:02:12.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:02:12.382 --> 01:02:13.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:02:13.356 --> 01:02:14.156 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

01:02:14.156 --> 01:02:15.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.

01:02:15.304 --> 01:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond Burgers.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond Burgers
are impossible.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Angel food.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I was hungry in there.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
