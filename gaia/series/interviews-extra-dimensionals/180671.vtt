00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Finally, we're here.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're in Japan.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We're in Japan.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe it?

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> This is very cool.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So we talked about
this last year--

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --during the first interview.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.257 align:middle line:10%
>> And just experienced
your contact event, so cool.

00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you have fun?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a lot of fun.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It was very cool.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have had several months
to digest our last sitting.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And from that
experience, and also

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the worldly things that
have been going on,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I've formulated a
bunch of questions

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to sort
of do a quick follow up.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of them actually were
answered during this event.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was cool.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicity?

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Synchronicities.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:10%
And maybe I'll just go a little
more in-depth in some of those.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I guess, if you
want to just jump on into it?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Give you your
time that you need.

00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't take
that long, as you know.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, Hello,
it's Sasha again.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, Sasha.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:10%
Thanks.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Wonderful to see you.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, thanks for this weekend.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.068 align:middle line:10%
>> You're very welcome.

00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Quite a show this weekend, yes?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite a show, yes.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I guess it's
just maybe the timing

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of the energies
with the solstice

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and, like you were
saying before,

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
what's sort of needed
on the planet right now.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's very cool to sort
of have these synchronicities

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
with my own meditations
and journeys

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and work and see the
crossovers and overlapping.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.398 align:middle line:84%
It's just all confirmation
and a lot of fun.

00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So from our last discussion,
a lot of questions arose during

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the editing and the
process and release.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted just to sort of do
a little quick follow-up today.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I know before when we talked
about the Pleiadian history

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:84%
a little bit and
where they came from.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But I guess a big question on
my mind that sort of hasn't

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
been clearly answered
was about the Pleiadian

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:90%
DNA in the humans.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I know we all
share this same DNA.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And then today I got
a bit of information

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
which was the first
time for me hearing,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.932 align:middle line:84%
you said at the closing, that
there's the Lyran energy mixed

00:13:11.932 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%
in with the Pleiadian energy.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know humans also have
the Lyran-- is it "Leer-ahn"

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
or "Lye-rahn"?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.061 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter, yes.

00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --backgrounds and energies.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm guessing, is
that pre-Atlantis states?

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, yes.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what it
sort of spread out.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.225 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering
if you could just

00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
go into detail a little
bit about the DNA lineage

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and then the reasons for
Pleiadians coming in the way

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that you guys are coming here
now and helping with our,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
quote, unquote, "ascension."

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that where is
not really the way it is.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of what
we're using during this time.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, as with
all galactic history,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:90%
it's a long story, yes.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:90%
So we will attempt to summarize.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
As you know, much
of the information

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that we've given in the past
having to do with the Lyrans

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is that they are some of
your oldest forefathers.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And from the point of
view of Lyran history,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
there was a split,
which is very common,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:90%
a split in their lineage.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So you could say that one group
continued on the trajectory

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
of their evolution.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And they became a lot of these
very ancient civilizations

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
like Polaris, Big Dipper,
Cygnus, places like that.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
group that split off.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And they wandered
around for a while,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
but they eventually
found their way

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth's solar system.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
This would have been
in very ancient times.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So man was primitive
at that time.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It would have been what you
call the in-between period

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:90%
of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of
an overlap there.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, this group of
Lyrans, they colonized Earth.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those colonies
were in what is now considered

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to be northern Europe.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And these Lyrans lived on
Earth for a very long time,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:90%
many generations.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But as they were
flourishing here,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
they were aware that
obviously Earth was not

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:90%
their home planet.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational
field was different,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen content was
different, things like that.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they took some DNA
from some of primitive man

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
at that time purely
to kind of tweak

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
themselves to adapt to some
of these Earth conditions

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:90%
in a better way.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So over time then,
that Earth DNA--

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:90%
the very primitive Earth DNA--

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:90%
became part of their identity.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Now also, if you have an
external civilization that

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
comes and colonizes a planet,
over many generations,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
really the frequency
of the planet

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
does help to change
their DNA too.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're having several
influences there.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So many generations-- many,
many, many generations--

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:90%
are passing.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And at this point it
was fairly peaceful.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:84%
At this point, Earth
Lyrans, we've called them,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
were living here
peacefully on the Earth.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But at one point let's
say the conflicts

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
from outside your solar
system began coming to Earth.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.375 align:middle line:84%
So this is when, you might
say, competing groups came.

00:16:58.375 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Would this be the Anunnaki?

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
In the broad sense, the
Anunnaki were those offspring

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:84%
from some of the royal
races, if you will,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
or the progenitor races
originally from Lyra and also

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
from Vega but then
became other species.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So there were a lot
of those kind of--

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
say battles, that's

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more dramatic--
more like political situations.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It became very uncomfortable
for those Earth Lyrans

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:90%
to live on Earth.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So regrettably,
they chose to leave.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is when they went
toward the constellation that

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:90%
you know of now as Pleiades.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have said many
times that we're

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
not from the seven
stars, Pleiades,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
but in the direction
of the Pleiades.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But when ancient man would
ask us where we were from,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
we would point
toward the Pleiades.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's how my particular
lineage of Pleiadians

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:90%
has ancient earth DNA.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The urge or the wanting to
help the humans ascend or go

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
at this point,
what is the drive?

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Is there karma involved?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, going back to that
time period then when the Earth

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Lyrans were here, they
formed a bond with early man.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, not the same kind
of bond as if they

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:90%
were a more advanced species.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But basically there was a sense
of protection, a sense of love,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of potential for
who these early humans could

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:90%
become.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Now throughout time, there
have been other ET groups

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
here visiting, taking
some DNA, we have to say,

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and leaving, not so much
at this point settling.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So these Earth Lyrans were
really the first ones.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So because of that bond, when
they had to leave the planet,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
it was surprising
to them that it was

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:90%
very heart rendering for them.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:90%
They did not want to leave.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they made a
promise to themselves,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and to the collective
consciousness of ancient man,

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
let's say, that there would
always watch out for them.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where it comes from.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And does this go back to the
days where humans would think

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
the Greek gods and the mythology
of the gods in the sky.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Are those gods then
Pleiadian, I guess,

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:90%
based in the majority of--

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Lyran.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Lyran, OK.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two royal
houses, let's say.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And again, these are our labels.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if someone else has
another source of information,

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the labels are different, but
the basic idea is the same.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Two royal houses--
one from Lyra and one,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
we say, from Sirius,
though it is Vega lineage.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So those two royal houses
tended to be in conflict

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.803 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're
sort of the same--

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they come
from the same source.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Same source, yes.

00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So do you on your
planet and you still

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:90%
conflict with each other, yes.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is i true, yeah.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is that conflict now
because that was so ancient?

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Long gone.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Long gone, OK.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Long gone.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of that--

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
However, you were asking
the question about karma.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like to answer that
question from the point of view

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.645 align:middle line:84%
of dropping a stone in a
pond and you see the ripples.

00:20:49.645 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though the consciousness
of those original beings

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
has long ascended,
however, the impact

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
of their struggles and
their karma, so to speak,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
has rippled through time.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
your planet now,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
you have still kind of
an idea of royal houses

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:84%
or different factions that
are still kind of playing out

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.504 align:middle line:90%
those territorial disputes.

00:21:23.504 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I see In a energetic way?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In an energetic, but it
manifests through the systems

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:90%
on your planet.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
know there are overlords.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
We know that that's some stories
that are told, manipulating

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:90%
the chess pieces on the board.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
These are very old echoes of
old dynamics that are still

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
playing out in the ripple
through the hologram,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're working their way
out on Earth at this time.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And would this go into--

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I sort of have a new base
of understanding of reality

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
with energies and archetypes.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Would this be like an archetypal
energy going to its source?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
As the archetypes
play out on Earth,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
you can see some very direct
connections with this.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The royal house of Lyra,
very often on your world

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
was depicted as lion.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So royal families, yes?

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The royal houses of Sirius,
which is Vega lineage,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:90%
very often depicted as serpent.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:90%
So dragon in the east.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Snake in the west.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the royal families
of what was once--

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:90%
well, you could say Pleiadian--

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
is usually a bird, whether
it's eagle or condor.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where we get
our mythologies from the sky

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and astrologies and
everything else.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
of the giants those

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:90%
were usually Lyran species.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> They tended to
be very much larger.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Are there any remnants
of the original Lyran

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
species left now, in current--
or I don't want to say now.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I know time is a little--

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> But does that still exist?

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it accessible?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say remnants,
do you mean skeletons or--

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's a whole
other thing we'd like to say.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, maybe that's what
all these giant skeletons are.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yes.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was actually thinking
of versions of that frequency,

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:90%
that density--

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
version of that race.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Does it still exist
somewhere in the cosmos?

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Which race?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The Lyran, the old Lyran
race that was the beginning

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Pleiadians.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they exist but
very different now.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course younger because
the originals already ascended.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking too.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:84%
We want to insert
something here because it's

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
connecting to something
you asked about earlier

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:90%
about the Lyran connection.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, for example,
there were little bodies,

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
little skeletons found
in South America.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Recently, yes.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And there were DNA tests.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's still
ongoing at the moment.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And at least what
was released publicly

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
is saying there's nothing
showing it's not human,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.925 align:middle line:90%
This is from a couple years ago.

00:24:46.925 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, a couple years ago.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I actually know the
geneticist who did the analogy,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well this goes back to
what we were talking about with

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:90%
you before.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is connected to Lyra.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to seem
like they're not alien.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> They're you in another form.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was
a lot of junk DNA

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that the geneticist
was going through.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.685 align:middle line:90%
I forgot his name.

00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It slipped my tongue.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But after the movie
"Sirius," which

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
was sort of highlighting
that experiment,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
came out, at the end the full
DNA test hadn't been done.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But I saw him
several months later,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and he told me in a private
meeting that what he could find

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:90%
was human so far.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't tell
you any difference.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course he would find that.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
some other people

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
who make claims that
they're hybrid, for example,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
mantis human hybrids.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And everybody out there in
the UFO communities says,well,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.258 align:middle line:90%
go get a DNA test.

00:26:05.258 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And they all say,
well, it's probably

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
going to be nothing different.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, what are we
going to find different?

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> There might be from time to
time genetic anomalies you will

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:90%
find.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But as we were talking in
the workshop a few hours ago,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.640 align:middle line:84%
about this idea of the
DNA on the light level.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's where DNA is sourced.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
If you have, so to
speak, a dead body,

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the capacity
to test the light DNA.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a shell.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically testing
the DNA of the shell.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:90%
If you had a live body--

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
well, it wouldn't be a body
if it was alive, would it?

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you had the life being
and you had the capacity

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to test DNA beyond what
your capacity is now,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
then you would see variations.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, not
huge variations.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess we're
all made from stardust.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess it all
comes back to that.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:84%
For Pleiades and their
symbols, today we

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
saw the symbol of
the hybrid seventh,

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
the seventh hybrid race.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Would the Pleiadians--
do they have

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
a symbol that they use in the
Galactic Federation of sorts,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
like a patch or an insignia
that they put on their ships?

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.232 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:42.232 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't we say before it's
not like, "Star Trek," yes?

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We understand the
spirit of your question.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
For the Pleiadian races,
much like what we just

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
said a couple of minutes
ago, we resonate with avian.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:00.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, so feathers.

00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> So winged beings.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even symbols of wings,
or that kind of thing.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, or flight.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So we would say there's not just
one symbol, because there's not

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.667 align:middle line:90%
just one of our--

00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleiadians, yeah.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> --there's many groups.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:90%
But that's a common flavor.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And is there a specific design
of ships that you prefer--

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%
more rounded or cigar shaped?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, a lot of the
time it depends on the era

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:90%
of Pleiadian.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So we talked to you a
little bit before last time

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
about the Billy Meier contacts
and the Semjase era, which was

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:90%
the typical sports model, yes?

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And that for you guys
was ancient times.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's ancient technology, but
we often can take that shape

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:84%
as a message to the
viewer if needed.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Generally at
this point, though,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.912 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of
plasma ships going on.

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, interesting.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Because plasmic energy can
move through the quantum much

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:90%
easier.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And plasma then would change
form all the time, right?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It can change form and color.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> More organic--

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.742 align:middle line:90%
>> More organic, yes.

00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --and less metallic.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.973 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we see these
plasmic looking orbs--

00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
well, you know,
we call them orbs,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually
like pulsating light.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Then these are actual ships?

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the situation.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> But yes.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.452 align:middle line:84%
>> And they can take on more
of a hard physical form at some

00:29:38.452 --> 00:29:39.252 align:middle line:90%
point?

00:29:39.252 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, when you see them
in the plasmic state,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it is the state between
states, let's say.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's the state between
hyperdimensional travel

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:90%
and physicality.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And usually we hang
out in that state often

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
but take on the
physicality if needed.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of craziness
going on, on the planet

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:90%
right now with the energies--

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --and things like that.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>> We hadn't noticed.

00:30:13.405 --> 00:30:14.335 align:middle line:90%
>> You hadn't noticed?

00:30:14.335 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] A lot of polarity,
which I'm assuming--

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.210 align:middle line:84%
based on this weekend's
conversation, out of polarity--

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.960 align:middle line:84%
once you can sort of find
that balancing point,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
comes the evolution,
comes the alchemy.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Which was very informative
and spot on for the times.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Paradox in the middle, yes.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The paradox in the middle.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But also it was said, I think,
earlier this year, you guys

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
said that because
of all of the chaos

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that contact right now
is like lighting a fire.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Or it's like kindling
in a fire situation

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and that there would be--

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I guess maybe in groups
like this it's OK--

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
but in a larger global
sense, everybody's

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
looking for that
disclosure moment.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are we at energy-wise?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Are we still in that kindling?

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:90%
But there's also still--

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
there's kind of two
camps, as you well know.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
There's the camp
that understands

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that the awareness about your
connection to the universe

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to come from
the grassroots level.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to come through
a shift in consciousness.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
come from the groups

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
like you've had this weekend
that are doing the work.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
grunt work really.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the camp that thinks

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.093 align:middle line:84%
that the release of the papers
and the proof and all of that

00:31:42.093 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to shift it.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But that can never
shift consciousness.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not that it's
a negative thing.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But as you well
know, secrets are

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
kept compartmentalized
on your world.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
mirroring the level

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness on
your world, you're

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:84%
only going to get
compartmentalized revelations.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That was my revelation with
the production of the Citizen

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Hearing and my involvement
in that, which was great.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a library
of information

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
for people to access.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It's still raising
consciousness.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:90%
It's still raising awareness.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:90%
But it alone will not do it.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started shifting

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:90%
into this kind of work.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This is more your
style, my dear.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This has more benefits.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So what do we have to
look forward to, I guess,

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of just
sticking to the grass roots,

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
sticking to the energy, creating
the wormholes and the energy

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration
for this to happen?

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the type of energy and
experience that you had this

00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:01.080 align:middle line:84%
weekend is really more of what
you're going to see and deeper

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and deeper and deeper.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:90%
But again, still small pockets.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> However, those of you
in those small pockets take

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the energy outward, and
then it cedes more readily.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So less lights in the sky
and more lights in our dreams?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not less
lights in the skies,

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.620 align:middle line:84%
less emphasis on the
lights in the sky.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
As you saw this weekend,
the work you did

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
was not focused on looking
for the lights in the sky.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you had
some tangible proof,

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
if you wish to share that.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't the focus.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So less attachment to
the lights in the sky,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:90%
maybe still enjoying it.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But the necessity-- and it
is an absolute necessity--

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
for the inward contact to
be built, as you well know.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Just to go back to
the discussion about--

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:84%
you said you're not
necessarily from the Pleiades

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.710 align:middle line:90%
but from that direction.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, a channeling came
through from a being that said

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
that they were from not
the Pleiades but in that

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:90%
direction--

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.502 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:19.502 --> 00:34:22.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --but further away, further
away beyond the Pleiades star

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that you guys?

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we spread far and wide.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So at the peak, there
were 250 colonies-- ish.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot in the
direction of the Pleiades.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the message I came
through was that future

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:84%
humanity actually helped
them with some technology,

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:90%
with some minerals--

00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
not minerals, but some metals
or some sort of technology.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It was like far future
humanity that they were saying.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of exchange.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's been a
lot of help obviously given

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:90%
to you since your inception.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
But as you evolve,
you give a lot

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
of help back to a lot of races.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily ones that
we're interacting with now.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Future ones that are
yet to be discovered.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, yes.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's sounds
kind of like "Star Trek."

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.160 align:middle line:84%
There are some "Star
Trek" overlays, yes.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But not in the physical
sense that we see third,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:90%
fourth density reality now.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's become more-- is our
perception of reality,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
as it's shifting
now, going to shift?

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Perception of reality
will shift tremendously

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:84%
away from a rigid, nonfluid,
linear, time-based reality.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the fifth
dimension then?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here we go with
the density dimension thing.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't use the
dimension thing.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We find it
confusing for many.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.330 align:middle line:90%
We use the density thing.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So our understanding is
many people talk about it

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:90%
as the shift to fifth dimension.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:90%
We call it fourth density.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Fourth density, yeah.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of the,
since our last talk too,

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:90%
is clarifying the densities.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
For the show, I have sort
of a density dimension

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:84%
graph or explanation that I
use and I do in panels now.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of going by our
scientific community,

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and our scientists measure our
reality now as fourth dimension

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:84%
with spatial up,
down, left, right.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And then space time
being, as Einstein

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.920 align:middle line:84%
said, the fourth
dimensional component

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.090 align:middle line:84%
to our fourth
dimensional reality.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the way I understand
the fifth dimension would

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.840 align:middle line:84%
be going outside the
linear sense at home

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and understanding our
reality in a nonlinear sense.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And we would also
say the beginnings

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of holographic
understanding of yourself

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.640 align:middle line:90%
as the dimension itself.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So and once we understand
that, then we can jump--

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
jump dimensions, jump timelines?

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
perception thing again.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you say,
today I'm going to jump.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like a fluid way of
moving through the energy that

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is intuitive and organic
rather than flipping

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
a lever on a "Star
Trek" panel, you know?

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Going through the wormhole.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Creating warp drives.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's a wonderful way
to help the understanding.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.257 align:middle line:84%
So all of these warp
drives and these things

00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:90%
are just metaphors--

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Metaphors.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> --for a more future energetic
perception of reality that we

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:84%
just haven't gotten to be
able to perceive it that way

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.590 align:middle line:84%
because of our third
density perception?

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Fourth dimension rather.

00:38:26.515 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So you take steps.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Little steps, and your
understanding increases along

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:32.840 align:middle line:90%
the way.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, which just
the past couple years,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.842 align:middle line:90%
mine has been blown away.

00:38:38.842 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
whoa, I think--

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and just when I
think I get it, I

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.702 align:middle line:90%
get a new piece of information.

00:38:42.702 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is accelerating too.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah,
the entire planet.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And our technology--

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I love following the
developments in technology.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, our
scientists just

00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.010 align:middle line:84%
created time crystals
which is literally

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:84%
manipulating time
for these particles

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to be able to sort of self--

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a new state of
matter, so they say.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
going into the quantum,

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
manipulating energy in the
quantum and bringing it back.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And then now this
new state of matter

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is being able to be produced
that's sort of influenced

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.060 align:middle line:84%
by time in a different
way because we're

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:90%
able to program it that way.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, this is a bridge.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a bridge to
quantum consciousness.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.538 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the whole
idea of spiritual--

00:39:37.538 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
you could call it spiritual
technology or quantum

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:84%
technology-- is
necessary to help

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
you understand the concepts.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, if you
look, for instance,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:84%
at the Zetas of the
future, this is all organic

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
within their consciousness,
and they no longer

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:90%
need technology to do it.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And before they
did need technology,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:90%
in the earlier Zetas?

00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.495 align:middle line:84%
>> And I sort of see
there's different camps.

00:40:04.495 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:90%
There's the spiritual side.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I follow both
the technological side

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
with quantum computing and
the developments there.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:90%
That would be more the Zeta--

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:84%
for Zeta, you know,
very intellectual

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:90%
going into those realms.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, we
don't have to say it,

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
but your forefathers have
already been down the road

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of pure technology
or pure mentality.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It is a dead end.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons for a
lot of the spiritual work done

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.350 align:middle line:84%
on your world, even with
this type of contact retreat

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and things such as
that, is to help

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.360 align:middle line:84%
you see there is another
road that is not a dead end.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to go down
the same road as the Zetas did.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, absolutely.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of came
here with that message--

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:40:52.308 --> 00:40:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --to let us know that.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And eventually, I guess, with
the nukes and nuclear weapons

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:90%
is that--

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:90%
that's eventually where--

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.540 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a
very good analogy

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:90%
because that's a dead end too.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And now we're messing with
quantum time crystals which

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is a whole another
form of technology that

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem to have
the negative ripples

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that the other
technologies have.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It has kind of a
safety mechanism built

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.307 align:middle line:90%
in, so to speak.

00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very cool.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you go into the quantum,
you cannot maintain separation.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You cannot maintain
egoic desire.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's only so far you can
go into working in the quantum

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:84%
if it's coming from
an ego motivation.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of these other--
the Draco reptilian energies

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.230 align:middle line:84%
don't work in those
realms that much?

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> The quantum realms?

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd say the AI reptilians
and those in that--

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends on--

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:90%
there's such a variety.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> --the archetypal energy
of control mechanisms

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and separation.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't work with that
sort of technology that much?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends on the era.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
specific species

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:90%
because there's so many.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> But there have been some
species who attempted to cling

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to physicality very tightly,
refusing to leave polarity.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And when a species does
that, their consciousness

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.930 align:middle line:90%
narrows very dramatically.

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And to them, it
seems like power.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:84%
To those looking, it
seems like certain death--

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:84%
certain suicide-- because you
cannot maintain that separatist

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.660 align:middle line:90%
energy indefinitely.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it just
dissipates into a nonphysical,

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:middle line:90%
into a nothingness.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.236 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.236 --> 00:43:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to ask about the
quarantine on Earth that I

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
heard was lifted
in 2012, so to say.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.440 align:middle line:84%
There's been different
discussions about this.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.045 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.045 --> 00:43:20.845 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using other information
that I've gotten and collected.

00:43:20.845 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:90%
So I may be off here.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is my
understanding that Earth

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:30.200 align:middle line:84%
was under a quarantine up until
sort of the December 21, 2012

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.000 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And now this quarantine
has been lifted.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And now we're able
to interact with all

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:84%
these different energies
and all this stuff.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> We're bursting.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Let us say something.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.182 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we're teasing you.

00:43:42.182 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Our perspective is different.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a little bit rebellious.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of quarantine
is another kind of one

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of those "Star Trek"
ideas in the sense that--

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.933 align:middle line:90%
well, let's say two things.

00:43:59.933 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit of
a "Star Trek" idea,

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
but it is also part of an
ancient memory from Orion.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Within many, many, many of
those very dark times in Orion,

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:84%
there was, what we've called
it in the past, an Orion net.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Which basically
kept consciousness

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:90%
locked so it could not explore.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other--

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to go off
into that because that's

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:90%
a whole other story.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:84%
However, on Earth, you bring
a lot of those Orion memories.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And very often
they get translated

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:84%
into spiritual
information that we

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:90%
see is a little bit distorted.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, we mean no
disrespect, of course,

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who's
teaching about this.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But energetically, in terms
of the one consciousness

00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are, it's really
impossible to quarantine anyone

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.820 align:middle line:84%
because you would
have to quarantine

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.780 align:middle line:84%
every single dimension
and every single timeline

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and every single probability.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't work
that way, as we see it.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.610 align:middle line:84%
However, we sense
that the people

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.700 align:middle line:84%
who were talking about
this quarantine idea

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:84%
were reading an energy but
perhaps interpreting it

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:27.440 align:middle line:90%
in a slightly distorted way.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is normal, because
humans at a certain level

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:84%
of evolution would naturally
interpret the polarized energy,

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the energy of separation,
as a quarantine,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.450 align:middle line:84%
as something coming
from outside.

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But being that all
of you are still,

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.350 align:middle line:84%
whether you're aware of it
or not, connected to the one,

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and you are that one
consciousness, no one

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.780 align:middle line:84%
outside of you can ever do
anything to yourself anyway.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may play out like a
drama as if it's happening.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't really happening.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.175 align:middle line:90%
So we're going off.

00:46:10.175 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We get kind of excited
about this idea.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, that actually
connects to my next question.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Then we'll let you go.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I had sort of this download,
maybe it was almost a month

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
ago, prior to the solstice,
the last full moon,

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of I guess sort of a quarantine
situation of more of like

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:37.060 align:middle line:84%
putting a fence around a garden
and protecting the garden from

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:90%
getting eaten by animals.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I guess my
revelation was am I protecting

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the garden?

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't the garden
have free will

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to just go and flourish
and be what it wants to be?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And don't the animals have their
free will to come and eat it?

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, am I
imposing a free will?

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You know all this
loop, the paradox.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the paradox.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:11.890 align:middle line:84%
This is actually one of
the biggest paradoxes

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that humans have to resolve
within themselves as you move

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:84%
from third to fourth density,
which has to do with can you

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:90%
control your reality?

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you put a fence
around the garden

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and actually control
what happens?

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:90%
The ego wants to believe, yes.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.950 align:middle line:84%
The reality is no because the
ego itself is an illusion.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> So does that--

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of, yeah, it was sort
of by doing so are we imposing

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
the free will of the universe
by putting fences around things?

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Was there a free
will imposement--

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's a word--

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:90%
where--

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but we have to say
something about free will,

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.950 align:middle line:84%
because you are hitting a lot
of the buttons that we like

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:90%
to talk about.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The concept of free will
only make sense from the point

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.160 align:middle line:90%
of view of egoic consciousness.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So from the
point of separation,

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:21.700 align:middle line:84%
the idea of being controlled
or being free is the only realm

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.130 align:middle line:90%
in which it makes sense.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I get it.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, this is another
thing you're going to evolve

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:90%
out of.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.540 align:middle line:84%
When people say it's a
free will this or that,

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that's an egoic perception.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that can be kind of
confusing for a lot of people.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.987 align:middle line:84%
Again, today in class,
we drew the big self

00:48:41.987 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and the little self.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The little self, because
the little self is polarized,

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:84%
believes in the idea of
control versus victimization.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The big self sees that there is
a whole organic process going

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:84%
on, everything
happening as it should,

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:84%
despite how the egoic
human perceives it.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And we mean no disrespect
by saying that.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, humans always have
the question about the chicken

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:90%
or egg, which came first?

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Which of course, as you
know, is a linear question.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's both.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.033 align:middle line:90%
This is the paradox.

00:49:17.033 --> 00:49:18.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the alchemy.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.765 align:middle line:90%
This is-- yeah.

00:49:21.765 --> 00:49:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And we covered this
a lot this weekend.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, and my first
introduction to all of this,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:84%
which blew my mind, was
about abduction scenarios.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember having this
conversation with Wendy Kennedy

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and she said to me,
it's a soul contract.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.053 align:middle line:84%
And that just threw
me for a loop.

00:49:45.053 --> 00:49:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was what really
got my wheels turning

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and got me into everything,
because on that level, when

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you go into that
expanded quantum level,

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.010 align:middle line:84%
the soul signed up
for the agreement.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
impediment of free will,

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But the ego cannot
tolerate that idea.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It can't.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.930 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It wanted to know
what came first, the chicken

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:04.730 align:middle line:90%
or the egg?

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to ask
about the quantum map.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that diagram
actually in the new book

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that you did some channelings
for my buddy, Miguel Mendoza.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yes.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.275 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was my first time
actually seeing the quantum map

00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:29.075 align:middle line:90%
diagram.

00:50:29.075 --> 00:50:32.037 align:middle line:90%


00:50:32.037 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my
god, that's amazing.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.270 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly how I--

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:84%
if I could draw a diagram of
how I see things, it was very--

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I had one of those aha moments.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do have to give
credit where credit is due.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We have drawn the
childlike version of it

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.380 align:middle line:90%
with Lyssa's art skills.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:10%
The beautiful version,
with much more detail,

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:10%
was done by Tosh Anestos.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And it has a lot more
information in it,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.430 align:middle line:10%
even than what we've channeled.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.290 align:middle line:10%
But we're happy that
you connected with it.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.092 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.092 --> 00:51:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Since we're in Japan, I
did want to bring this up.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And we mentioned this a
little bit before with Reiki.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The symbols of
the Reiki symbols,

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:24.020 align:middle line:90%
are they cosmic in their origin?

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course--

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is--

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --we can't reveal it, yes.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> But the main symbol that
has something to do with

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.500 align:middle line:90%
the spiral?

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely universal.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you know, and
especially for the viewers that

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:46.070 align:middle line:84%
might not know, the mountain
in Japan, Kurama-san,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:53.210 align:middle line:84%
or Mount Kurama, is where
Osui-san channeled the Reiki

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.520 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, the
information and the system.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.370 align:middle line:84%
However, the energy
of Mount Kurama

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:84%
has had ET contact
for millions of years.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very
significant, let's say,

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:84%
pilgrimage spot, especially
for energy workers.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, I took a journey
there back in September and had

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:18.730 align:middle line:90%
a little UFO sighting.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.040 align:middle line:90%
So I figured that was--

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yes, it's a big area
for UFO sightings, for sure.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:32.185 align:middle line:84%
Going into the symbols and
language, some people now--

00:52:32.185 --> 00:52:33.560 align:middle line:84%
it seems more
often than before--

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:84%
are sort of channeling
light language,

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:84%
or they're calling
it light language,

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:44.000 align:middle line:84%
which is an audible almost
gibberish to the normal person.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But could you explain a
little bit about what that is?

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, there's
two tracks here, OK?

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.240 align:middle line:84%
You have those
practitioners who are well

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:90%
versed in the light language.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our definition
might be different than theirs.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But we see it as
an energy download

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.400 align:middle line:84%
that can be expressed into the
physical reality in a nonlinear

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.510 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So even though
there's language,

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and maybe sometimes people
write it, or they speak it,

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
it's manifesting in the physical
reality in a nonlinear way

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:33.740 align:middle line:84%
so that the listener or the
reader can connect with it,

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.810 align:middle line:90%
receive the download.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But what they receive goes far
beyond linearly reading a book.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I see, OK.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And often, it has lots of
codes that unlock at the right

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now some-- taking a
totally different tangent--

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:57.800 align:middle line:84%
some new channeling
students sometimes

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.130 align:middle line:84%
connect with light
language as a way

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to train their
ability to channel.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, it's
a little less intimidating

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.890 align:middle line:84%
than having to bring
through information.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good way to train
the channel energetically.

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
disappears, and then they

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:20.100 align:middle line:84%
are able to channel in
their native language--

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Earth language, that is.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
because a friend of mine

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:27.140 align:middle line:90%
recently had that experience.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Channeling potentially for
the first time, started off

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.710 align:middle line:90%
in a language--

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.270 align:middle line:84%
what appeared to
me because I had

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.940 align:middle line:90%
heard light language before--

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and then sort of turned into an
actual physical conversation.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly, yes.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had a lot of
channeling students--

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Lisa's channeling students--
go through a training process

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.150 align:middle line:84%
using light language as like
training wheels on a bicycle.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Not that it's
always like that.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.490 align:middle line:90%
But for some it is.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And from what I've heard,
it tends to sound similar.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.298 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:55:06.298 --> 00:55:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just the
frequency of vibration,

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:11.300 align:middle line:84%
but even from different
people from different speaking

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:90%
languages--

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.440 align:middle line:84%
different cultures,
different languages,

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.570 align:middle line:84%
having different
backgrounds-- still

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:24.390 align:middle line:84%
speak this light language that
has a very similar feel, tone

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.190 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know you look at--

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:84%
well, it's interesting,
light language.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But the light frequency, or
excuse us, the light spectrum

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:90%
has many frequencies.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And sound is one.

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes sound can
represent a light frequency.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.076 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
back, back, back,

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:52.880 align:middle line:84%
back then before physical
beings spoke a language.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But you're going back to,
maybe you might call it,

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:57.300 align:middle line:90%
primordial sound.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is more representative
of the universe itself.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> So closer to an archetype?

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Archetype, exactly.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Does your civilization
still use words and sounds

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:11.570 align:middle line:90%
like that to talk?

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, when needed.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> When needed, OK.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> When needed.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> But is it mostly telepathic?

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Half and half,
or maybe 60-40.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I see, OK.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.570 align:middle line:90%
60 being talking?

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Telepathic.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:26.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, telepathic, OK.

00:56:26.936 --> 00:56:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But humans' version-- humans'
understanding of telepathic,

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.390 align:middle line:90%
again, is like "Star Trek," yes?

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You see the alien
sending it, yes,

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and then you hear the sound.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like that.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It's more-- perhaps Bashar
calls it telempathic?

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Telempathic, yes.

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a knowingness of
the communication that's being

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.880 align:middle line:90%
given back and forth.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So like another set of
information and in addition

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to physicality expressions
and facial emotions?

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like the sixth
sense or something.

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's a simple
example for you.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You have maybe a very
close partner or spouse.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:12.177 align:middle line:84%
And you know each other
so well that sometimes you

00:57:12.177 --> 00:57:13.010 align:middle line:90%
don't have to speak.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you can
communicate almost all day

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.840 align:middle line:90%
without speaking.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But extrapolate
that to a planet.

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:90%
So everybody's at that level?

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:57:26.715 --> 00:57:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm just reading
my last question here,

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:32.656 align:middle line:84%
which was pretty much
going into the [LAUGHS]

00:57:32.656 --> 00:57:33.585 align:middle line:90%
seventh [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:33.585 --> 00:57:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting how
that got answered today.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll read the
question, but it's sort

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of a repeat of what
today I was just saying.

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Could you look into the
future of humanity--

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure you guys get this
question all the time and then

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.218 align:middle line:90%
roll your eyes--

00:57:53.218 --> 00:57:55.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> We humor you.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:58:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> --and looking into fourth,
fifth density humans and how we

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:84%
might be shepherding other
civilizations as you are

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.460 align:middle line:84%
shepherding us into
these higher frequencies?

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In humanity's future, who
will humans be genetically

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.390 align:middle line:90%
connected to?

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're curious what
your answer is, actually.

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:30.932 align:middle line:84%
>> My answer is we
will find out, I guess.

00:58:30.932 --> 00:58:32.640 align:middle line:84%
I figure that's what
you're going to say.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.753 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't open
our presents for us.

00:58:34.753 --> 00:58:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but also it's not
fixed because it really depends

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:40.660 align:middle line:84%
on the trajectory that you
take with your evolution.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Which then leads to
the question of--

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and this will be sort
of the last topic

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.570 align:middle line:90%
question of the evening--

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the individual and
the collective choice.

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I know individually
we have the choice

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.990 align:middle line:84%
to jump into whatever timeline
we want to, so to say.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.020 align:middle line:84%
But yet on a collective
level, humanity

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is on its own timeline based
on its energetic frequency.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Humanity itself
is a collective.

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So even if individuals
jumped ship, so to speak,

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.880 align:middle line:90%
the collective carries on.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So it carries on in whatever
trajectory the momentum

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.050 align:middle line:90%
is moving toward.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't know if
that quite answers--

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my understanding of
the quantum human collective is

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's infinite in
its choices of timelines

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and directions and
everything else.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> So the individual human--

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.220 align:middle line:84%
me, for example--
having this experience

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:57.290 align:middle line:84%
in this human collective
reality, as it sits right now,

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm only able to have
this experience because

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of the vibration of
my individual self

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is vibrating in conjunction with
the human collective experience

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:12.940 align:middle line:90%
at this now moment.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it works?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here's the thing.

01:00:16.253 --> 01:00:18.225 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:20.200 align:middle line:90%


01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
When humans say the
individual self,

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:29.088 align:middle line:84%
the question is, are
we talking about--

01:00:29.088 --> 01:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you know where we're
going with this?

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The small self,
which is an illusion?

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Then does the
illusion get a choice?

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Ultimately, it is always
the big self making the choice.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.470 align:middle line:90%
The ego does not like that idea.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But you will
eventually learn to not

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.300 align:middle line:84%
accept it grudgingly
but welcome it,

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
because that is when
you can really surrender

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.220 align:middle line:90%
into your true nature.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the peace is.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:03.880 align:middle line:90%


01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So myself trying to vibrate
a specific frequency right now,

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.398 align:middle line:84%
so I can have this
human experience--

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's coming from here.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.025 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the ego.

01:01:12.025 --> 01:01:12.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:12.825 --> 01:01:15.783 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the ego
saying, you know,

01:01:15.783 --> 01:01:17.075 align:middle line:90%
I want to have this experience.

01:01:17.075 --> 01:01:17.875 align:middle line:90%
>> I want this.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I want this, so I'm going to
do everything I can to vibrate

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:21.550 align:middle line:90%
at this experience.

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ohm and meditate.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
You're in a sense
getting in your own way.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when I'm part of
the human collective, as is,

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and then to fully embrace that
as opposed to trying to focus--

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I guess, it's kind of
a little bit of both.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But instead of that individual--
see, I always begin--

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%
thank you for clarifying.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
The individual part
of me was like, well,

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.390 align:middle line:90%
I can make anything happen.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, old school metaphysics.

01:01:52.955 --> 01:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is the old
school metaphysics.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I create my
reality, which I do,

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%
but on a bigger perspective.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> On a bigger perspective, who
is the one creating reality?

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not the
illusionary ego self.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, that makes a lot more sense.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Darn, right?

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, I mean, it's great.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's cool because
then it's now I

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
can release of
that attachment to,

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have to ohm in at
this time and do this.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, my rigidness of my
schedule of trying to be this

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
perfect resignation, vibration
to have this experience.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't mean not
to do your practice.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
But do your practice with
joy, not with rigidity.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's perfect.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And I think we'll end with that.

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for always
coming in and sharing

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and for this awesome
event again this weekend.

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%


01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And please say hi to--

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.260 align:middle line:90%
is it "Hee-doh-key?"

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.060 align:middle line:90%
"Hee-doo-key?"

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, your--

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> My counterpart.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> If he's around.

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know what
we're going to say that.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.025 align:middle line:84%
You can say hello
to him yourself.

01:03:02.025 --> 01:03:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I can say it, yes.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, he said
hello to you last night.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, he did?

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, when we were out there?

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So there you go.

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
We so enjoy your
questions all the time.

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And much love to you.
