00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:04.464 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:53.568 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, ah.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] I don't
want to scare you,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.204 align:middle line:90%
but I just felt a raindrop.

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:03.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, jeez.

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Just-- but it was one.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So Micheila, thank
you for being here.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know we
felt a rain drop,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.457 align:middle line:84%
but we'll-- we'll
power through this.

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we're good.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Not power, but, you know,
we'll get through this.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So Micheila Sheldan, you're
intuitive, channeler?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you could describe your
list of credits and abilities?

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, boy, credits
and abilities--

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.165 align:middle line:84%
yeah, intuitive
channel describes it.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's so many
words and terms out there--

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Light worker.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, I think
so, most definitely.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that my soul
was prepared to do this work.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And I came into this life.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been told to have messages
sent through me as a channel.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And those messages
come as a variety

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:90%
of different ways and forms.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I am a trance channel
I'm a conscious channel.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm an unconscious channel.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
I can be a medium at times.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you explain the
differences between trance

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:90%
channel and conscious channel?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of what I do is
trance channeling.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So my consciousness
is, of course,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
always working, because
the information is

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.585 align:middle line:84%
flowing through
your soul and coming

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:90%
through your consciousness.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really out
of the picture.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So when I say trance channeling,
I go into a trance state.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I slip completely
out of my body.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And the way I
describe it to people

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is my left side has
always been the receiving.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:90%
The right side is the giving.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel that entity
or that presence

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of that being come
in on the left,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and I feel myself
slip out the right.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that being or that
higher consciousness

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is using my voice, my hands,
my eyes sometimes, and concepts

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that are available to me
to get this message out

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't typically
remember much of what

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.175 align:middle line:90%
is said during those sessions.

00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the primary
difference between conscious

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
channeling and--

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.375 align:middle line:90%
>> --trance channeling?

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can consciously
channel as well.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I started doing this,
I did a little bit of both.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But mostly I was a
conscious channel,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of interesting,
because I didn't really

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:90%
know what I was doing.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.158 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, can you explain?

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> --I could-- yes.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I went
through a spiritual awakening.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a really crummy time
in my life, as most of us

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
awake to our spiritual
gifts during those times.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I started to meditate regularly.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I was not a meditator,
knew nothing

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:90%
about Eastern philosophy.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It synchronistically
came into my awareness,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
meditate very regularly.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So when this was
going on, I started

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to notice some really
interesting things,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that during my meditations,
I would hear things.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So I would hear voices, names.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> How long into your
meditations did it start until

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
you started getting
these voices as messages?

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I fell into it really fast.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, I fell
into meditation very deeply,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing
things right away.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize
I was channeling.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just really thought
that my mind was making things

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Would that technically be
considered channeling, then,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
if you're hearing the voices
and having those conversations,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:90%
or is that more--

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> How does that work?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was a whole process.

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people go through this.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I used to call
myself clairaudient.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, right, yes.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would hear
and then I would say,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
or I would hear
and I would write.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So like not necessarily
automatic writing,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:90%
but you would--

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I would--

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:90%
I kept a journal.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
This time in my life, there
were so many crazy things

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.862 align:middle line:84%
going on that I had a journal
by my side a long time.

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
When I would meditate, you
know, when I was sleeping,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and I would write
everything down.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I would come
out of my meditation,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I would write things
down that I would hear.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But as I meditated more, and
as I went deeper into trance,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, at first I was
only getting a couple words,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
or a sentence.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.342 align:middle line:84%
And then I was getting two,
and then I was getting four.

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:59.425 align:middle line:84%
And then I was coming
through from my meditations,

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't remember.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I was getting
so much information

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was going so
deep into trance,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't write it down.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But I started to voice
record myself around that time,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
which was really fascinating,
because then I was convinced it

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:90%
wasn't me.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.172 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my brain.

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But the original
question you asked

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.922 align:middle line:90%
was about conscious channeling.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And something that
I noticed around

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
that time, when
I was meditating,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is when I was walking about
my day between meditations,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I was having two-way
conversations with people,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
or I was hearing things.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And especially when I would
have conversations with other

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
people, just casual stuff, I
would hear things during those

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
conversations that I
thought they said to me,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:90%
but they really didn't.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:90%
So I would get home--

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.943 align:middle line:84%
let's say I was having a very
casual conversation with you,

00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, about, I don't
know, your golf game.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I would get home
and I would think, boy,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
they said something
really personal to me.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't sure if
he said it out loud,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:90%
or if I just got it in my head.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the conscious side,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, where you're picking
things up when you were--

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> But then you--

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:84%
have you since been
able to be more aware

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and say OK, that
person did say this,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
or this is something
I'm picking up on?

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Or does that still
get fuzzy in some cases.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's very clear.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So now-- yeah.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.162 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very clear,
and I'll tell you why--

00:06:22.162 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
because I really tuned
into the extra sensory,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and how it feels.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And I often tell
people this too--

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I can ask a question
very consciously,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell if my mind
answered the question,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
or if it came from
somebody else,

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
because I can feel
it right my body.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's an
unmistakable vibration

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that comes with a
connection to these beings.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- it's
very high, blissful.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what I
was going to ask you,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
because you do
channel many beings--

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> --or many entities, beings,
collectives, all of it.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I was going to ask,
how do you differentiate?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
How does it-- is it a feeling?

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.492 align:middle line:90%
Is it a voice?

00:07:04.492 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
How does that--
how does that work?

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, oh boy.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been
such a process.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:90%
It's changed so much.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I always get a name.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So I always know who's
here, because I ask.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was very adamant early
on that I wanted to know.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But early on, I worked
a lot more with archangels,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:90%
ascended masters.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the way
they showed up in my body.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I could feel their
facial features come in.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:90%
They-- they have faces?

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah-- well, I could--
you know, Mary Magdalene,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel the softness
of her presence.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I almost bow my head.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I feel the long hair.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Metatron, you know,
very hard angles,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:84%
very serious g-- you know,
he's straight and to the point.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that
seriousness about him,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and to the point where when I
was channeling these beings so

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
much, I would know who was
coming before they got here,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
because I could feel in my
body the shifts and changes.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, archangel
Michael has--

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that halo you see around
the head in many pictures,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel that, that light come in
around the head, and I think,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
oh, here comes--

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
would tell me that I

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
would take on the
characteristics in my eyes

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and in my face of
any of these beings.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
happens much anymore.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure why, except
that I channel differently now

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
than I did back then.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, and I'm--

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And when-- how
long is back then?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of this started
for me really strongly back

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in 2010, and where I had a lot
of just synchronistic things

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
that happened, and I was really
actively engaging in bringing

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
these energies in.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've been channeling
actively since 2010,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.072 align:middle line:84%
although, of course, you
know, looking back now,

00:08:53.072 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I know I was channeling
longer than that.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And even as a child--

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:90%
I

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>> See.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --I was channeling.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you-- would you mind
going into the spiritual

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:90%
awakening aspect, or what--

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, not at all.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, if
it's OK to share.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was struggling
with chronic pain.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I have an abnormality
in my hip joint.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:90%
It's on the left side.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.435 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know this.

00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:17.235 align:middle line:90%
>> An ab-- ab--

00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an abnormality
in my hip joint.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:90%
My SI joint is--

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's supposed
to be nice and straight,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and mine is kind
of curvy on X-ray,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.378 align:middle line:84%
and so it doesn't work as
well as what it should.

00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this at the time.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I had
this pain in my hip.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And so over the
course of many years,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I was on this Western
medicine hamster wheel,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
right, going to all these
doctors, and prescriptions,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.122 align:middle line:90%
and not getting any better.

00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I was getting worse.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pain had
gone into my leg.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
numbness in my leg.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I had pain in my back.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
notice during this time

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
that the pain would really
increase with stress, you know,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:90%
changes in my life.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really major
one around that time.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.148 align:middle line:84%
I-- my family made a move from
one side of town to another.

00:10:10.148 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a really
big deal, although I

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in favor of it.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I-- just to back up, stay
at home mom, mainstream mom.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a degree in
marketing and PR,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
was very successful at that
for a long period of time,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
decided to stay home
with my two kids.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%
And loved it--

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I was in the volunteer world.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I ran the PTA, you know,
the Girl Scout troops,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Stepford wives?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, totally.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%
And really happy doing that--

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I had a ton of friends.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I was very important
in the community.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And ended up in a
neighborhood where

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make any of
that work to save my life.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make a
friend to save my life.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I tried to make that old
life fit in this new house,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and found myself very alone.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:90%
So I was 40 years old.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I was in chronic pain.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed out.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm on a variety of
medications, you know,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking anti-inflammatories.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking pain meds.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm on anti-depressants.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm washing it
down with alcohol,

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:90%
you know, 5 o'clock every night.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had to take a pretty hard
look at myself in the mirror,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something
needed to change.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, such a divine
plan, you know?

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I look back at it
now, and, I mean,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I was really picked up and
put in this house to heal

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and really come
into these gifts,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
because that's
exactly what happened.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Very synchronistically
enough, I was

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
exposed to Eastern
philosophy in this home.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.012 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did--
how was your expos--

00:11:39.012 --> 00:11:41.105 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody
gets exposed.

00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Like, how were you exposed?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, well, I ended up
being referred to a trainer,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
a physical trainer, who had
a specialty in corrective

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:90%
For your back pain?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> For me-- yes.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So I started seeing
him, and this guy

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
was all about
Eastern philosophy.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And here I was.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.957 align:middle line:84%
I had done some Google
searches at the same time.

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I was doing all
kinds of different things.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at, what can
I do to control this pain?

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it in my mind?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it in my head?

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I had
been looking online

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
at people who were meditating
to get rid of their pain,

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
or disconnect from the pain.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm referred
to this guy,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and he refers me to the
"Law of Attraction" books,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.228 align:middle line:90%
So it opened my mind.

00:12:28.228 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That's cool, and
he's somewhat connected

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to the medical community,
I would assume,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:90%
if you were referred to him?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of, yeah,
alternative, though.

00:12:36.483 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Still, I'm like,
oh, are they waking?

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.108 align:middle line:84%
>> It was completely
diff-- oh, well, you know,

00:12:40.108 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I think they kind of are.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, but yeah, so he
kind of opened my mind.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I think not only did he open
my mind, he was somebody who

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
mirrored that, you
know, where I was kind

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
of looking at it on my own,
and I didn't have anyone else

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in my world that was kind
of confirming that to me,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
that that was a good way to go.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So I started going
down that path.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
brought the meditation in.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I brought
it in, I was really rigid.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I would meditate morning,
afternoon, and evening.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoa, well, you must have
noticed a difference pretty

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
early on in the pain factors
and stuff in order to commit

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
to doing it much?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw a huge difference.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I would go into states of bliss.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I would go into just
heightened states

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
of bliss in my meditation.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So I knew something
really good was happening.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, my physical body
was not responding right away.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I had
started having my nerves

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:90%
oblated to relieve the pain.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was having my nerves
severed every six months.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I stopped driving because
I was afraid to drive,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
because I had such
numbness in my legs.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
What really ended
up happening-- well,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:90%
it all culminated in one event.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
So I say 2010.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It was actually Christmas 2010.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And I tell this story to--

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, I tell it to
all my live audiences,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and it's a great story.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But I was having Christmas
here at my house,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and having the whole family
over, planning a meal.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had bought a
tenderloin to cook.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat meat anymore, but
at the time, that's what I did.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was a special recipe
that I made with this meal,

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and I do it every year.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I woke up that
morning, ready to prepare

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
this meal, excited,
happy, went to the pantry,

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and realized I had
forgotten to buy three very

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.285 align:middle line:90%
key ingredients for this meal.

00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:29.812 align:middle line:84%
OK, there was a red wine,
a spice, and a beef stock.

00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it already
Christmas morning then?

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It was Christmas
morning, Christmas day.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So you know, there's
no stores open, right?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.273 align:middle line:84%
And I got out a stool, and I was
pushing things aside, thinking,

00:14:39.273 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I could mock this
thing up, right?

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be something--

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was so stressed with
all these people coming.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I called the local
gas station, knowing

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
they'd have some grocery
items on their shelf--

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that my stress
level at that time

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:90%
would increase my pain.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I just need to
spend some time in meditation.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my bedroom
and closed the door.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I went into a very deep
meditation that day.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard voices
in my head before,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:84%
but this was a quite
different experience.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I heard a male voice, very
loud, as if in the room with me.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And all I heard was three
words, and those words

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:90%
were "I am Jacob."

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And it shook me, you
know, it was so loud.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It shook me out of the med--

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So like in stereo?

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Was it--

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was just
a very loud voice.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:90%
And but I wasn't afraid.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this
peace come over me,

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
this blissful feeling of love.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to communicate back,
but I didn't get any answer.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.185 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that was really cool.

00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:45.145 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what that was, but
you know, this is ridiculous.

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I can salt and
pepper this thing.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.478 align:middle line:90%
It's Christmas morning.

00:15:47.478 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Right, so I went back out
and went to the pantry,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and opened up the door.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And there on the shelf, right
at eye level, in a straight row,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
were the three ingredients that
I needed for the tenderloin.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So I was just overjoyed.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I just remember it being
a very beautiful day.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I was happy.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, I
manifested something

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
in my physical world, or this
Jacob, he helped me out here.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You got to be--

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't say a darn word
to anybody, made this meal,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and had just a great day.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So after that, I kind of put
that out of my mind for awhile,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't really want--

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't ready to really
accept that that happens to me,

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I kind of thought, wow, I really
missed that stuff on the shelf

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:90%
that morning.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I must have been pretty
stressed out to--

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
right in front of
my eyes, you know?

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, you started kind
of talking yourself out

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of the miracle that
it probably was.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I think a
lot of us do, right?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I really did for good.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It took me a good year to even
tell that story to anybody.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I kind of kept it to myself.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But what it did do was
it piqued my curiosity.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.932 align:middle line:90%
So I really--

00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It happened once,
it can happen again?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I really wanted to
understand, what was it

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
that I was accessing?

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Who was this Jacob?

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, and really
just went on this journey

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:90%
to figure it out.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.462 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out was Jacob
was a special guide for me.

00:17:12.462 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It's like a gatekeeper.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people call
them gatekeepers.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
He was really there
to help transition me

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:90%
into this role as a channel.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you go about
finding this stuff out?

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I channeled him.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I connected with him.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And during this first year,
I really spent a lot of time

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
in meditation, receiving
information from him

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and talking to him.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And what he told me was that
we had a past life together,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:90%
a past life connection.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So he was a young boy in a
past life, and he was lost,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and I took him in.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
And I fed him.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I clothed him.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I cared for him.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So he comes back in this life
indebted to me in this way

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to help me facilitate and
remember this connection

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Is he still incarnated
on this planet somewhere,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:90%
or how does that--

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> He has--

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Or has he ascended?

00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he has ascended, yes.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And he is no longer really
in the picture for me.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of surprised one day.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I thought he'd always be there.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:90%
But one day he stepped in--

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
it was actually
not too long ago.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It was about a
year ago, I guess.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:84%
He stepped in and said that
his work with me was done,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and he was really here for this
transition that I was making.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But back to the story,
what really happened

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that was incredible
and beautiful

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
was I completely healed myself
through this connection.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Over this year period?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think by the time
it was all said and done,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:90%
it took me a couple of years.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just
one thing or another.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But-- I guess even
at the time, I

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize I could
ask my guides how to heal.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize I could channel
information about my own body

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and what I needed to do.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But I just credit being aligned
in such a harmonious way

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
with that energy for
all of the things

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
show up in my world.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I look back on
that time in my life,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:90%
how beautifully that path--

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh oh.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I felt big raindrops.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we're
going have to go in.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.979 align:middle line:90%
It's coming down pretty good.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, just going to
clap for sound.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> We're back.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We're dry.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> We're dry.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:90%
We escaped the wetness.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So you were telling
us about the process?

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:90%
You got the--

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Jacob, the voice, came in.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
You were able to save
Christmas dinner.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I was.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, you were on this
journey for a year or two,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
or a couple of years, to
use this information to heal

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so what
I was explaining was,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really realize at
the time that I could channel

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
in guides and get information
about my physical body,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and where I needed to
go, what I had to do.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I don't
think that's really

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:90%
what it's all about.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
What happened was so beautiful,
because I was completely

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
aligned with source
in such a way

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that all of the things I
needed fell right into my lap.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back on
that time in my life,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm really just amazed at
the path that fell before me,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I started off with
this therapist,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you
know, he referred me

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else, who sent me to
a book, who sent me to someone

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
else, and I ended up in a
nutritionist's office, who

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
just happened to be taking
the last person for free

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
when I couldn't pay for it.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:90%
You know, all of these things--

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 100% pain free today.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I got off
all my medications,

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.730 align:middle line:84%
completely changed my lifestyle,
and had guidance on how to do

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:90%
that in every area.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I completely
changed my diet.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I started to exercise
differently, live differently.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I was connecting,
you know, differently.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, during this process,
was there ever any resistance

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:84%
for the information, for
listening, or was it exciting?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Was each step fun and
exciting, leading you

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to the next excitement?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It was fun and exciting as
long as I did it in my closet

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and nobody else knew about it,
because I wasn't really ready

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to talk about this
experience to anyone.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that other people--

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
was it just your personal
fear of judgment, or--

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --or-- or had you
had talked to somebody,

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and then it ended up backfiring?

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> This was a big leap for me.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, here I was in this
mainstream world, right,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
living in this, you
know, PTA world.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.257 align:middle line:84%
And so I wasn't exactly
living in an environment

00:21:59.257 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
where I wanted to come out
and talk about the fact

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was channeling,
you know, spirit guides.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say it
ever backfired on me.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
It was all about my process.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through
this whole integration

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
period of just
releasing the fear

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.802 align:middle line:84%
and becoming who I was, and
delving deep into my soul,

00:22:18.802 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding,
you know, this is what

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.718 align:middle line:90%
I'm meant to do in this life.

00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But it took me
awhile to get there.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a very skeptical
mind, so I questioned a lot--

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For the skeptics
out there, by the way,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
we people in this reality are
the most skeptical about it--

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --because-- me too,
I-- and everybody I talk

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to, they're, you know, very
skeptical about everything.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we're the
worst, the most skeptical.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And then-- but then we still--
we end up having things happen

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to us that make us--

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, I guess
believe or buy the situations,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the ideas, and the
belief systems that--

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you know, and what
happened was I ended up being

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:90%
led to my tribe.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
As a part of that
path, I ended up

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
attracting a whole
new group of people

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
that I call my family, you
know, that were ones I was

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
comfortable sharing this with.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I started sharing
my recordings and things,

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
they were like, you have
to put this out there.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:90%
And I went, ooh, no.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no, no.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was not what
I wanted to do at all.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What about time
period-- what time,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.507 align:middle line:84%
what year was this when
you started connecting with

00:23:33.507 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:90%
the tribes this way?

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> 2012, I think,
towards the end of 2012.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And I work with an organization,
you know, Flower of Life Center

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Ethann Fox runs it.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And I happened into--

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:90%
he's a brilliant energy healer--

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I happened into one of
his energy healings.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And just Google
searched, was looking

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
for something in my
area spiritually based,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and just stepped
into this new world,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.673 align:middle line:84%
where I finally had
people around me.

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't
grow up with anyone--

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I was raised Catholic Italian,
strict Catholic Italian family.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in my family or my
immediate friend, you know,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
peer group talked about this
stuff or even did it, you know?

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So when I stepped
into that, I kind of

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
felt like I had some
more support around me.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, I could be myself.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it wasn't-- you
know, I, many times, looked up,

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
and you know, why me?

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, why me?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was told
very early on that

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.652 align:middle line:90%
I was meant to be a channel.

00:24:31.652 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I was told my body
was prepared for this.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I was told I was meant to
channel in front of audiences,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and I was very resistant,
very resistant.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, resistant to the
audience and to the open world,

00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
but you had already been--

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Not resistant
to the messages.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The message, you
had already been--

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
it's already been happening.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, interesting.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm the opposite.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I want to channel.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I want to get this information.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and it's
funny, everybody says that.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Like, are you kidding me?

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- you know,
I want to do this.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to get the downloads.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, I didn't like
to listen to my material.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I liked to channel,
but I wouldn't often

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:90%
listen to my recordings.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And I, you know, again,
around that time, I told you,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I found my tribe.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.795 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you have
to listen to your stuff.

00:25:12.795 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You have to listen to it.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.097 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
to really listen,

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
because I went this weird period
where I just wouldn't listen.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.217 align:middle line:90%
But I just was so blown away.

00:25:22.217 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, that was
such confirmation for me

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't me, you
know, this wasn't me.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had to put-- you
know, who am I not-- you know,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:90%
like, who am I to--

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, that was my journey,
from who am I to do this?

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Who am I not to put
this out into the world

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
was where I ended up.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, cool.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming you
adopted your own teachings,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or the teachings from
the channels, or--

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I am a
self-taught channel.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I just fumbled into
this along the way.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I did-- you know, once I
discovered I was channeling,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.212 align:middle line:84%
then I tried to take
some classes in it

00:26:03.212 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and tried to read
some books on it.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
was I was already

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
kind of doing it my way.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So not that I didn't get
some valuable information

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:90%
along the way--

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I definitely did.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things, I did
take a class here locally

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:90%
in channeling.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And what was funny was I just
used to channel whatever came.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So whoever stepped in and talked
to me was who I talked to,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
or the messages I gave.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this class, the
one thing that I learned

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
was that I could channel
almost any consciousness.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wasn't
just about having

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:90%
to wait for whoever came.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, we would come
into class each day,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and she would say,
you know, we're

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
going to channel
Native Americans today.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at
the instructor and say,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Now I do.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure enough,
you know, I would

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
feel the facial hair coming
in, the long, you know,

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:84%
the feathers, and here
I would be channeling,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:90%
you know, a Native American.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So there was-- my
mind was opened

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
by a lot of those experiences
to my own capabilities,

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and how I could, you
know, work with this gift.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And now do you--

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
when you do private sessions
or group, public appearances--

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've seen
videos where you

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.653 align:middle line:84%
tend to have kind of
a set group of people

00:27:16.653 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:90%
that you work through.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:22.085 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- are you that open that
you channel the neighbor's cat,

00:27:22.085 --> 00:27:23.460 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, how
does that work?

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I have channeled
the neighbors cat.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, no, and I have
channeled the neighbor's dog.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I can access those energies.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a typical--

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.647 align:middle line:84%
if I were, you know,
if I'd give you a call

00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and schedule an appointment
for a private session,

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
what-- how does
that typically go?

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> My channeling
has changed so much.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I used to-- and I still do this.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I would work with your
guides, teachers, masters--

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I would just keep myself open
to whoever came in for you.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to
say, though, I have

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:84%
started to work with
some very specific groups

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:90%
and collectives.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And I notice now, maybe
within the last year,

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a consistent collective
that comes in as well.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:90%
So I get a lot of energies.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting session,
because I get passed souls

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, I work
with archangels

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:90%
that come in for people a lot--

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you say apostles?

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Archangels.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Or before that--

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:90%
pacels?

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Passed souls.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, passed souls.

00:28:23.593 --> 00:28:24.968 align:middle line:84%
I thought you said
like apostles.

00:28:24.968 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like from
this incarnation,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
somebody that you knew that
may have passed, right,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:90%
will step in--

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:90%
not often.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Parents, and
that kind of thing?

00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Or brothers, and--

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I get past lives too,
so souls that step in that were

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:84%
connected to you in the past,
present, future, you know.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever get the same
soul talking to the person?

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Like their past lives?

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
my past life version

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.785 align:middle line:84%
of me coming through
and talking to myself?

00:28:51.785 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:90%
That would be interesting.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I have had--

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I have had the
higher self step in.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, oh, that
person's higher self?

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's essentially
them talking to themselves?

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I have had that happen.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, as an audible, not like
I'm getting this information

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:84%
from your higher self, but can
you actually channel the higher

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:90%
self?

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.998 align:middle line:84%
>> You can channel
the higher self.

00:29:12.998 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But you know, what
I've been taught

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is you really need to ask
permission to do that.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.945 align:middle line:84%
So I don't, you know, go around
channeling everyone's higher

00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:21.070 align:middle line:90%
self to figure out what's--

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.362 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, I know, but that--
that-- has that happened?

00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> But in the session, I wait.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I place the
highest intention

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.073 align:middle line:84%
for the best
information and wisdom

00:29:29.073 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%
that you need in the moment.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So if your higher self comes
in, we use that information,

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and I would be channeling
that from your higher self.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.403 align:middle line:84%
Or, like you said,
the neighbor's dog.

00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Or the neighbor's dog, which
is a really funny channel,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yeah, I was going to
say, that's-- that's got to be

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:90%
weird.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It is funny.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.903 align:middle line:84%
I've never laughed
quite so hard.

00:29:47.903 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of dogs, and this
might be getting off subject

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, but
animal consciousness--

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I've heard other
materials and talks

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that it's still sort
of two dimensional,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that the nature's world is--

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:90%
like we're 3D, or--

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, not two dimensional,
second density consciousness.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:90%
So not two dimensional.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Scratch I said that.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We're in third
density consciousness,

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and the animals
and nature kingdom

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:90%
are more to second density.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:84%
During your work with
that consciousness,

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
has it ever confirmed or spoken
about these sort of densities?

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I know as me being me, and the
human race as well, there's

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
a collective of us
that would really

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.797 align:middle line:90%
like to classify everything.

00:30:44.797 --> 00:30:45.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:45.597 --> 00:30:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know it's-- probably
we shouldn't be doing that,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:90%
but it just makes it easier.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.183 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like,
especially for yourself,

00:30:53.183 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:84%
having all these
diff-- working with all

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:84%
these different energies,
in a way, you sort of,

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
when working with other
people, classifying

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:90%
is something that we humans do.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.583 align:middle line:84%
Um, I-- I haven't come
across that information.

00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say it would
be a great question

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to ask the guides
when we channel.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.193 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as nature goes, the
way nature shows up for me is

00:31:17.193 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
more-- you know, and I don't
know about the density,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's more like a fifth
dimensional energy connected

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.677 align:middle line:90%
to the fairy realm.

00:31:24.677 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what I-- you
know, as matter of fact,

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a really beautiful
channel the other day

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
for a client who has this strong
connection to the fairy realm.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was really all
about connecting nature

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:84%
through that fifth
dimensional energy.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So, but good question
to ask the guides.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And this may be a question
for them later as well,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
but the fifth
dimension, for you,

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean to you?

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So I-- what I understand
based on the channeling that

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.855 align:middle line:84%
I've done, is that we are moving
towards a fifth dimensional

00:31:54.855 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
consciousness here
on the planet,

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.855 align:middle line:84%
although it'll be quite a while
until we're able to really hold

00:31:58.855 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that dimension here
as a consciousness.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We would be connected
more as a one.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm understanding is the
heart chakra is very involved,

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
connect together.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And even you and I
sitting here right now,

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.623 align:middle line:84%
our heart chakras are
opening to each other,

00:32:14.623 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:90%
and we're connecting in this--

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:84%
my guides use the word
encapsulate a lot.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:84%
We encapsulate each
other in energy or aura.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, we are
always neutralizing the energy.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we're
bringing each other either,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, into a higher space,
which is usually the case,

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, we can go
the opposite way as well.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension,
we are connecting more

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.190 align:middle line:90%
through that heart chakra.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
things that come in

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
are all of the changes
we want to see.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are
creating through that energy

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:84%
for our highest
good, we will start

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring in and hold
these free energy technologies.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We become self
healers because we

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can hold that dimensional
reality, which is, you know,

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
connection to source through
the one consciousness.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:05.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of changes in
institutions, the way we teach.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So we'll still have
physical bodies.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll still-

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that we still will
have physical bodies, but--

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and I did-- so I work a lot with
the Lemurian Ninth Dimensional

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves the
Lemurian Ascension Collective,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:90%
ninth dimension.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I channeled a
class with them.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a 10 week class.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.843 align:middle line:84%
And they talked a
lot about preparing

00:33:26.843 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
for fifth dimensional
energies, and that

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:90%
was the basis for the class.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about how
we have these energy

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.420 align:middle line:84%
bodies that as physical beings
we associate very separately.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are the emotional,
the spiritual, the mental,

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and the physical bodies.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:90%
We see them all.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We recognize or associate with
them as being very separate.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.805 align:middle line:84%
>> One more time,
emotional, spiritual--

00:33:46.805 --> 00:33:47.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Physical.

00:33:47.605 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Physical.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And mental.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And mental, OK.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the fifth dimension,
when we hold that dimensional

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:84%
reality here, we're beginning to
recognize or merge those bodies

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:90%
together as one.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:90%
So they become cohesive.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:84%
They become one and
working together.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
practices and the tools

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and the information
they give in this class

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
is how to help you integrate
those bodies as one.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they're all
working in concert.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And essentially, once those
are all working in concert,

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
does that mean we're at fifth
dimensional consciousness?

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe there's a couple
of parts of that equation.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.451 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel as if
as individual souls,

00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:90%
we need to do the work.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, true,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so we need to
integrate all of that ourselves

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:84%
with these different
emotional, physical, spiritual,

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:90%
mental body.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But we also need to
do a lot of clearing

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being
able to connect,

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.985 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about,
through the heart

00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:84%
chakra from the highest place
of love frequency, right?

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what fifth
dimension is all about.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's peace, love,
sovereignty, freedom, you know,

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
things, we manifest

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:90%
through one consciousness.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They talk a lot about
manifestation, too,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and how that changes
in the fifth dimension,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
because we come into a
better awareness about how

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.480 align:middle line:90%
we manifest as a one.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And we-- I feel like we have
to go through this singular

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.220 align:middle line:90%
version of that first.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, we talk about the
microcosm or the macrocosm,

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like
energetically, that's where

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:90%
we are as a consciousness.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.200 align:middle line:90%
We're working on that level.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to catapult
it into this one dimensional--

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or five dimensional,
fifth dimensional, right,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:90%
one consciousness.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, we'll all
be telepathic in the fifth

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.780 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we'll have that.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And that, through your different
channels and information,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
have you come across
the difference

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.560 align:middle line:84%
between telepathic
and open heartedness?

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it they're one and the same?

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Is one more mental,
I'm assuming?

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, they always go back
to connection and alignment with

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that heart
chakra is the key

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:90%
to holding that connection.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we hold that connection,
we become telepathic, you know,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're accessing
energies outside

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
of what the confines
of this three

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to fourth dimensional reality,
wherever you want to say you

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
are, you know, is holding us.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.980 align:middle line:84%
What are like the
three things that one

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:84%
can do to help in this
ascension process?

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, work on yourself
is the biggest thing I get,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about the
microcosm or the macrocosm.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So as singular beings
or singular souls,

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
we're going through right
now in our physical worlds

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
what the planet is going to be
going through next, I believe.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting pay
really close attention

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to the things that are coming
up in your physical world that

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
are mirrors to your
multidimensional self,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:51.023 align:middle line:84%
meaning these can be
relationships, issues

00:36:51.023 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:84%
with your path or your mission,
where you thought you were

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
headed one direction,
and all of a sudden,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:90%
you hit that roadblock.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's-- and I
hear it all over, you know,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
like workers are really
struggling right now with a lot

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:84%
of different things
going on in their life.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.502 align:middle line:84%
Where they might have had
the finances coming in,

00:37:05.502 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
the finances went away.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.312 align:middle line:84%
Where they might have
had the relationship,

00:37:08.312 --> 00:37:09.580 align:middle line:90%
the relationship got rocky.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something going on
there that needs to be cleared.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, family issues,
physical body issues--

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
all of these things are
coming up in order for us

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to heal them right
now, because it

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
helps us to purge that karma,
right, that lower dense weight.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have to bring
the higher frequency

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:90%
to all of those things first.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And then once we do
that, we become lighter.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:84%
We step in and accept these
energies in a bigger way,

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and then we're able to move
into this fifth dimensional

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.890 align:middle line:90%
consciousness easier.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, I know
myself, and people around me--

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:90%
everybody's dealing with stuff.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I guess we're always dealing
with stuff, but it does--

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.218 align:middle line:84%
always, I guess, the more recent
stuff is more in the memories,

00:37:53.218 --> 00:37:55.635 align:middle line:84%
so you're like, man, I can't
believe all this stuff that's

00:37:55.635 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:90%
happening--

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's hard, not just--

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.845 align:middle line:90%
>> --changes--

00:37:56.845 --> 00:37:57.645 align:middle line:90%
>> --physical.

00:37:57.645 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --and everything else, so--

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, another thing
they always say is there's been

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:84%
a really big emphasis
on the emotional body,

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
because we manifest
through the emotional body,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.003 align:middle line:90%
is what I've been told.

00:38:12.003 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a lot
of different camps on this,

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.128 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, people
think, well, our thoughts

00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:90%
create our reality.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But our thoughts, what the
guides have been saying,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:90%
actually create the emotion.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion that we
carry and the emotional body

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
creates the frequency
by which we manifest.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are, as souls
in a fourth dimensional space,

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.472 align:middle line:84%
that have pulled all
this junk up, right?

00:38:33.472 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We raised our
frequency, and now we

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:84%
have all this junk
we have to clear.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to get really
emotional about it.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:90%
We put the mental body to it.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:90%
We try to figure it out.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Like, why does this happen?

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:90%
How do I clear it?

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We get all tied up
inside, resistant.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And then our emotional body
holds this lower frequency,

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
which is actually blocking
us from the very stuff

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that we need to move
forward, and to accept

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to get into that fifth
dimensional space.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And emotional body
holding this frequency--

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.290 align:middle line:84%
can you define that a
little bit for those--

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.897 align:middle line:84%
I-- I-- I get it, but just
for those who are watching,

00:39:06.897 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> That is-- that is
how we hold energy.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So if we have-- if we're
getting really stressed out,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.318 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, there's something
in our physical reality

00:39:16.318 --> 00:39:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that's come up to
heal, and let's say

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that's a relationship, because
that's a big one right now.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, we hold
a lot of guilt,

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.455 align:middle line:84%
stress, anger, fear
around, holding

00:39:28.455 --> 00:39:30.580 align:middle line:84%
onto the three dimensional
aspects of those things.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Those are the frequencies.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are the
frequencies that we hold.

00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
another thing I've

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
been told about
relationships is a lot

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of the reason they're coming
up as a focal point right now

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is because relationships
were very third dimensional.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
started these relationships

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:84%
in a very third
dimensional consciousness.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can't take those
types of relationships

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Describe third
dimensional relationships--

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:01.590 align:middle line:84%
just like the old paradigm
of-- or the old kind of--

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.140 align:middle line:84%
what's the word
I'm looking for--

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:90%
is it stigma-- astigmatism?

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah--

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Or kind of the--

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Programming.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Programming, yeah.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we're programmed
that by a certain age,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:90%
we get married--

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Boy meets girl--

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --you get married,
have kids, do this thing.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:20.305 align:middle line:84%
Girl-- you know, guy
cheats on girl, girl--

00:40:20.305 --> 00:40:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, we go
through all that.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.097 align:middle line:84%
>> --controlling
issues, you know,

00:40:23.097 --> 00:40:27.270 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff that's the
standard operating manual

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.480 align:middle line:90%
of relationships.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.855 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
talking about.

00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Patterns that we are
repeating that are programmed

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that were very third
dimensional in nature.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind
of stuff that's

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
coming up across the board that
we need to pay attention to.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And people are getting all
wrapped up inside going, well,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.438 align:middle line:84%
do I have to divorce this
person, leave this person?

00:40:45.438 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The guides are
saying, of course not.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in some
situations, yeah, it

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
was time to recognize that you
had to let go of that energy

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
serving you anymore.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.667 align:middle line:84%
But you're called to bring
a higher frequency to it.

00:40:57.667 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You're called to bring that
fifth dimensional, you know,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:84%
frequency of love
to the situation

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:84%
in your physical reality, and
heal it from that standpoint.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's how we really
step into this, I think.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's kind
challenging us, right?

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's all-- it's bringing
all that stuff up

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.150 align:middle line:84%
for us to take this new
frequency that we hold

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:90%
and apply it in our daily lives.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so not going to
the fallback of victimization

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.280 align:middle line:90%
or blaming, or--

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --you did this to me, but
instead working through those

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.095 align:middle line:90%
emotions, those lower--

00:41:30.095 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, we label them negative
emotions, and then finding kind

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of an alternative solution.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And working things out.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The key is, I think that
those negative emotions

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and those in body of
frequency are separate, right?

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.440 align:middle line:90%
They keep us separate.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So those are the emotions
we have to pay attention to.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Because where we're
headed, we can't really

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:90%
be separate anymore.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is this whole
aspect of our reality

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.940 align:middle line:84%
where we have placed this
protection around us.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.920 align:middle line:90%
We're always on the defensive.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We-- you know, somebody
is going to hurt us.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Somebody did us wrong.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It's really breaking
down that wall,

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.140 align:middle line:84%
because we can't carry
that wall with us

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it seems any of those
lower frequencies that we were

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:84%
just talking about seem
to be creating separate--

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:84%
a separation, in
some form or fashion.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a--

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:84%
so I do this panel
at anime conventions.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I did it last year, and
I'm doing kind of an updated

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.240 align:middle line:90%
version this year.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that I've noticed,

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and that I tell everybody--
whatever action you're taking,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.600 align:middle line:84%
whatever emotion
that you're feeling,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:90%
does it create separation?

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's, you know, and that's
kind of a good rule of thumb.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's saying something
and you listen to it,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and before you act on it or
do something, does that saying

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.555 align:middle line:90%
or does that action--

00:42:56.555 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is it going to
create separation?

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.720 align:middle line:84%
If it is, whoa,
whoa, whoa, maybe

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that's not the best
course of action

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to take in whatever
situation you're doing.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like that's very
much along the same lines.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and the other
thing, too, you know,

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about being separate--

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of light workers
who've been in this movement

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.625 align:middle line:84%
for a long time and
are doing healing work

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing are seeing

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.390 align:middle line:84%
their past and their missions
kind of, you know, things

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are crumbling and
not going as planned.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And another message about
that has been how we are--

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:90%
it's a turning point, right?

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.822 align:middle line:84%
We're going from that
singular focus, where

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:90%
you might have been a healer.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you did Reiki, or
cranial psychotherapy,

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and you were a one-on-one
type of a healer.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're moving into
a more collective based type

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of service.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So everything's
kind of, you know,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:56.370 align:middle line:84%
shifting and changing to equate
to that one consciousness.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So it can be mirrored in
all aspects of your life.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.436 align:middle line:84%
>> The bad guy is no
longer the bad guy.

00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I've
noticed, is, you know,

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.380 align:middle line:84%
those people over there in, you
know, the Middle East, those--

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:90%
they're bad people.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, no-- you know,
the government,

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and they're bad people.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So we can't have that sort
of bad-good outlook anymore,

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:90%
because we're all here, right?

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.927 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of this one
collective human experience,

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
even though they may be on
the other side of the planet.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and when you
think about the frequency

00:44:28.218 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:84%
or the energy behind that
type of thinking, you know,

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:35.150 align:middle line:84%
what I've gotten a lot of is
you're actually expanding that

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:90%
So take war as an example.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, war in itself
is a consciousness.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a consciousness
of lower vibration.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.013 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying, those
people over there, and you're

00:44:45.013 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:90%
angry about that--

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
even if, you know, they
say that people are really

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.995 align:middle line:90%
well intentioned.

00:44:49.995 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:84%
They want to send food and
provisions and all this stuff,

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But it comes from this
lower frequency pla--

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.450 align:middle line:84%
this place of feeling, you
know, guilt or shame, or--

00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Still above--

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --above somebody else, too.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so you have to really
pay attention to how you are

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:84%
using your energy
in those situations.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Are you expanding
that consciousness,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:84%
or are you really, you know,
separating yourself from it

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and going a new direction?

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's also something
that I've woken up to of recent

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:90%
too is the advocacy world.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:90%
So I used to be kind of big in--

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.240 align:middle line:90%
and I know you were as well.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.342 align:middle line:84%
We talked last night,
that, you know,

00:45:28.342 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I put on this event called
The Citizen Hearing, which

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:38.230 align:middle line:84%
was an advocacy type event,
pushing the government to force

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:90%
them to make disclosure.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- just the
words, force, and push--

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, well, actually,
you look at those words,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and the energy
behind those actions,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and you're only fueling what--

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, a March
Against Monsanto.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I did a couple years
ago, two years in a row.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm realizing,
and I read somewhere,

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or I heard somewhere that all
these activists would call up

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa, and say hey,
can you come and march with us

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.390 align:middle line:90%
and be part of our group?

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, not until
you have a peace rally.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go and
march with you guys,

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:23.680 align:middle line:84%
because I'm only going to
march for peace, not fight.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's literally the
same energy that's used to--

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.448 align:middle line:84%
you know, that those
guys are using,

00:46:30.448 --> 00:46:31.490 align:middle line:90%
and you're just feeding--

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a war.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> --you're feeding the war
with that same intention,

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that same energy.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a war.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I agree.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went to
my first my March

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Against Monsanto rally a couple
years ago, downtown Detroit.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.577 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
excited to get there.

00:46:44.577 --> 00:46:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I got there, and
I actually didn't march.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I let them go down
the street, because I

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was such an
angry vibration that I

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.560 align:middle line:90%
couldn't participate in it.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, waving signs,
and people are honking horns,

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, we're gonna
wake up to the fact that GMOs

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.680 align:middle line:84%
are in our food, and
it's gonna kill you.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:90%
You're going to die.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And like that actually--

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a little fear
in the energy body.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But you know, something--
this is something--

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.095 align:middle line:84%
I think it's part
of the process,

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
because this is another
message that I've gotten,

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.827 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
unusual, and I never

00:47:15.827 --> 00:47:16.910 align:middle line:90%
thought about it this way.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.190 align:middle line:90%
But it makes sense.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.893 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are
purging a lot of karma,

00:47:19.893 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're going through
this turbulent time in order

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.840 align:middle line:90%
to make some change.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.343 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
haven't awakened yet.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are varying
levels of consciousness.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, think
about when you

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:90%
awoke to some of these things.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.580 align:middle line:90%
How mad were you, right?

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my gosh, I can't
believe this has been going on.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, oh, I was the--

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I was the conspiracy
nut because I was--

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I was posting all about
the GMOs, and the--

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're
taking us and putting

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:84%
things in our bodies, and chem
trails, and all of this stuff

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.020 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:84%
yeah, very angry-- 9/11,
destroying the towers.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I was forcing it
all on everybody else, trying

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to wake everybody up.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, I get it.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:47:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well and one
day, I was trying

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to explain to the mailman
what chem trail-- you know,

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.000 align:middle line:84%
he's come to my
door, and I was like,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:90%
did you see that up there?

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
at me like I'm crazy.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do that.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I used to do that.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, you get past it.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
what I've been told

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is that the next two years
are going to be pretty rough.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going through
a major transition here.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot going
on on the planet that's

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.620 align:middle line:90%
going to have to fail.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But we have to also consider
that a lot of human beings are

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:84%
beginning to awaken, and they're
holding a higher frequency.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.807 align:middle line:84%
So what's the first
phase of that?

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:31.765 align:middle line:90%
>> First phase is the--

00:48:31.765 --> 00:48:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It's anger.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.923 align:middle line:90%
So that anger has--

00:48:33.923 --> 00:48:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The conspiracy-- I call it
the conspiracy theory phase.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, like the crazy--

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is a conspiracy.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's not, but just you
get very passionate and upset

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You want everybody to know.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.340 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a
really good place.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, it does.

00:48:47.215 --> 00:48:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But see, as this anger is
released, it, you know,

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.480 align:middle line:90%
it's an energy, right?

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Like attracts like.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand
that the more people that

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.203 align:middle line:84%
are awakening during this
coming year to two year period,

00:49:04.203 --> 00:49:06.370 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see some
more bad stuff in the world,

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.870 align:middle line:90%
because it's got a mirror.

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's the clearing
we're going through.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.382 align:middle line:84%
So they actually say
it's a good sign, right?

00:49:13.382 --> 00:49:14.965 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you see
people, you know,

00:49:14.965 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not that we need
to participate in it.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But at least we
know, you know, we're

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.130 align:middle line:84%
clearing some of that
energy and that karma.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and you know, going
back, some of the quotes--

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I forget the exact
quotes, but you know,

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King and Gandhi,
and even Albert Einstein--

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the famous quote is "You cannot
solve a problem or an issue

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.110 align:middle line:84%
with the same consciousness
that was used to create it."

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So that quote, and you
know, Martin Luther King

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
said basically the same
thing, you know, all the time.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- you can't go to
war and create disharmony,

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and think that we're
going to get through this,

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.840 align:middle line:84%
with the rights issues,
and blacks rights,

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.678 align:middle line:90%
and the same with Gandhi.

00:50:01.678 --> 00:50:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The same thing,
we're not-- you can't

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.750 align:middle line:84%
win by stooping to
their level, so to say.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no-- there's no way.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then logically, it took
me awhile to process that.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.880 align:middle line:90%
But logically, you can't.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.440 align:middle line:84%
When you look at war, and
you're going to fight war,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you're just-- there's no--

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.280 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that
can overcome it

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is acceptance and
forgiveness and love

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and not engaging in that energy.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> My guides even take
that a step further.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They say, if we want to
heal wars on the planet,

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.200 align:middle line:84%
we need to heal the wars
within our own lives.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So the war with the neighbor,
the war with the family member,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the person you haven't
spoken to for two years--

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:90%
you have to heal all that stuff.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you
know, it's showing up

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in our physical world as a
part of where we're headed.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's powerful stuff.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.430 align:middle line:90%
But it's kind of cool.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.017 align:middle line:84%
I like that analogy,
to look at kind

00:50:51.017 --> 00:50:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of our own personal
journeys, and then

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.722 align:middle line:84%
see that maybe yeah,
that's probably

00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:59.680 align:middle line:84%
the next couple of years,
that humanity is just

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.618 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
the conspiracy phase.

00:51:01.618 --> 00:51:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I call it the conspiracy phase.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And then moving on after
that, like now, life is great.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know, sure, I still
have stuff I'm dealing with.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But my outlook, and it
sounds like yours as

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:19.390 align:middle line:84%
well, on unfortunate
events and things--

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.100 align:middle line:90%
they don't linger very long.

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They're processed very
quickly, and then, you know,

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.400 align:middle line:84%
you're off to the next
exciting synchronicity.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Because then once you
stay, I notice, at that,

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.090 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it higher
vibration, or I would just

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:37.450 align:middle line:84%
say less destructive
choices in life--

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:43.400 align:middle line:84%
then the synchronicities start
coming in that are amazing,

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it happened so quickly,
like you're thinking about--

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.940 align:middle line:90%
did I tell you?

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:84%
The other day a buddy
came over, and we

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.980 align:middle line:84%
were talking about South America
and all this amazing energy

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and things that are happening in
South America, and yoga retreat

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:84%
centers, and raw food groups,
people, a lot of healing.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And infrastructure there is not
as nice as we have in America,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but the heart
centeredness of the people

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.470 align:middle line:90%
are really coming together.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
He was telling me he was
in, a couple of years

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.900 align:middle line:84%
ago, in Mexico for
the Day of the Dead.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:29.647 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed-- it was just so
odd and strange, and he said,

00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:30.730 align:middle line:90%
you definitely have to go.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow, OK.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I never thought about
that, but yeah, I have to--

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to Mexico or
South America or wherever

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.550 align:middle line:84%
they celebrate the Day of the
Dead, and experience that.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I get a
call from Columbia to be--

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:84%
to go to do an anime
convention appearance

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.150 align:middle line:84%
for five days over the course
of the Halloween and Day

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:52.763 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead.

00:52:52.763 --> 00:52:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that amazing?

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I love when that stuff happens.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's happening
so much faster too,

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's like so in your face.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, but I love it.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what you all have
to look forward to, is this--

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.650 align:middle line:90%
the synchronicities.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And once you get through
the conspiracy phase--

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.255 align:middle line:84%
get through it-- it's going
to be nice and joyful.

00:53:14.255 --> 00:53:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to be there
for awhile, but yeah.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yeah, it's
part of the process.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, should we
take a little break,

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and then get into
channeling a bit?

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
that you wanted to share?

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that sounds good.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.015 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:53:28.015 --> 00:53:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:90%
