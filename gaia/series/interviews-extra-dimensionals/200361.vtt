are.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Who are you, really?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Where did you come from?

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:90%
What are you made of?

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
patterns in our bodies

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
are like the patterns we
see on the planet (ECHOING)

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.742 align:middle line:90%
on the planet on the planet?

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%

animals, the life, the light,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
it might flow (ECHOING) it
might flow it might flow.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
spiral of a galaxy

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:90%
is the same as a nautilus shell?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
What connects the
universe together?

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.064 align:middle line:84%
What unites us (ECHOING) what
unites us what unites us?

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
We're all just figuring out
what's going on on the surface,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on
at the deeper layers.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
We are an event horizon.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we become
the one, and the zero.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:90%
We complete ourselves.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
We perceive ourself.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I know that I am.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've
been back there.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm
going this direction.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And I have the power to choose.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, I can be conscious
of others (ECHOING) others.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:90%

of energy, moving

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
around and through my body--

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
that this energy is tangible.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel the tingle
of entanglement (ECHOING)

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:90%
entanglement entanglement.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You begin to craft
your mind as a crystal,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.948 align:middle line:84%
as a structure that you
can fit things into.

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%

You wear many hats, my friend.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.203 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> You wear them well.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.792 align:middle line:90%

You did an awesome number of
workshops and presentations,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and standing ovations
from the audience.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%

speaking at a UFO

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:90%
you know we have now.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have so much
knowledge and information

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
on so many subjects,
from sacred geometry

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to self-empowerment to
our galactic history

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to coding and engineering,
as we were talking as well.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
So wow.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
What happened in between?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, ah, you know, a lot
of it started around the time I

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:90%
was about 15 years old.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And as an early teenager, I
was a pretty disgruntled kid.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I was depressed.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a lot of what I
was being taught in school

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
were lies.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Teachers couldn't
give me the answers

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:90%
that I was really looking for.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone through a pretty
intense life trauma, where

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
my stepmother, whom I was--
my dad's love of his life

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
died in a car accident,
while I was on my way

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
back from India,
spending a week or two

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:90%
at this spiritual center.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:10%
And came out of this space
where I was experiencing things

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:10%
that I hadn't quite
ever encountered before,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:10%
people spontaneously
bursting into song

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:10%
and crying and having these
very cathartic experiences.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It really got me to start
questioning everything

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I had some really
intense questions

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:90%
that had not been answered yet.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.025 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky enough to have
a really amazing older friend.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
His name's Chris Orellana.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:10%
He and I would sit
and philosophize,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:10%
talk about reality and the
nature of the universe.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:10%
So we set out to do
some experimentation,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:10%
said let's try--

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:10%
let's try putting our
fingers together like this,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and focusing on the space
between our fingertips.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:10%
And just slowly
separate, and see

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:10%
if we can maybe feel where
we're looking at that space.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, when I did
that as a 15-year-old kid,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and I felt this
tangible magnetic force

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:10%
and tingling in my
fingertips, and then I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:10%
saw this stream of
smoky like light

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:10%
moving between my
fingers, and instantly

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:10%
something just popped
inside of my head.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I had full-body chills.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It was like I found the
force, and that it was real.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And my life instantly
changed overnight.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly could not stop
playing with my energy body.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was testing it.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'd put something
over across the room,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd see if I could
locate it with my hand.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
We started doing
blindfolded martial arts.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:10%
And I started having all of
these downloads about energy,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:10%
how it moves and how it flows,
and where does this experience

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:10%
of matter come from?

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Where does the experience
of emotions come from?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
How do we create
frameworks of thought?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And literally went on
a trail for a couple

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
of years of recovering
what I've come

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
to call my Akashic library.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I had
been storing away

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
my information and
all of my downloads

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
through my existence
in some kind of space,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that at the right time,
I could unlock that space

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and regain that knowledge.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I found that just
by doing a certain move

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
in a certain
direction, or focusing

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.520 align:middle line:84%
energy in a certain way,
nature would respond to me.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
The wind would blow
and flow, or a bird

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
would suddenly come out of the
place that I was focusing on.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I'm in communication

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, and
was fortunate enough

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
to find different websites and
writings of different people

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that not only confirmed some of
the experiences I was having,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
but pointed me in the direction
of certain ancient spiritual

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
traditions, where people had
already had these experiences.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They'd already connected
to this fundamental field.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I was alone.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I was like, why isn't this--
this is not in school.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- never
been taught this.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:10%
Nobody's ever told me this.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And yet I then, over
time, start to find out

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of the
ancient Earth religion

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:10%
traditions, from Druidry to
Wicca to indigenous cultures

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
around the world, and then
all the way, of course,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:10%
to the other side-- the Taoist
traditions, the martial arts

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:10%
traditions, which has always
been a deep inspiration

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:10%
and passion for me in my life,
this movement as a form of art.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
they all referenced

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.620 align:middle line:84%
this fundamental
field, whether it

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
was called Chi or Prana
or Ki or Life Force

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Energy or Great
Spirit, or you name it.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
OK, this is real,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and this is something ancient.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And for some
reason, it's missing

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
from our current science and
our current understandings.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:90%
So I dove into science.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Where is this fundamental field?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Where is this energy?

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And that search
led me to discover

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that they were actually
pretty smart, after all,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were in
fact looking very

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:84%
realistically at the
nature of spacetime,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and that ether was actually a
part of physics all the way up

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
until the early 1900s.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And discovered that
Einstein had basically

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
played a part in
wiping the ether out

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
from our physics
because of his work

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
in special relativity,
which proved how light

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:90%
could interact with light.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But then 10 years
later, he comes out

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
with general relativity,
in which spacetime

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is this fundamental fabric and
structure, and realizes, well,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
of course, you can't have
this spacetime structure

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and these fundamental properties
to spacetime without an ether.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've been on this
scientific quest to find

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:90%
the missing links.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've seen
from this past weekend,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
you've done a pretty good
job of connecting the dots.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the unified harmonic
matrix in Adam's Theory

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:90%
of Everything, right?

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Or is it-- is there--

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
are those doing the same, or--

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So early on in this
process, I had a vision.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
There was just this moment
where I kind of phased out,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing I knew,
I was in this vision.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And the vision
was showing me how

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
every layer of the
entire universe, starting

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
with my own eyeball and my own
body and the plane around me

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth around me,
to how the moon rotates

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, to the
solar system, to the galaxy--

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:84%
we're all connected
in similar patterns.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, I began
to see the entire universe

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
as actually part of an
energetic thread that

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
was creating protons, creating
the fabric of space itself.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw how
the same patterns that

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
form the nucleus of an atom, and
the way that the electrons flow

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
around that nucleus
and chain together

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to create amino acids
and DNA, is exactly

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of rotational,
energetic, vibrational lensing

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that we see as the
solar system is

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
traveling through the
galaxy, and rotating

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and spiraling with other stars
in these very consistent,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
high-level gravitational
relationships.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
through this vision

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that showed me that the
smallest stuff in the universe,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
being composed of the biggest
things in the universe,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
perfect connection

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:84%
between the macrocosm
and microcosm, and also

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the biocosm inside
of us, and then also

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
what I call the
metacosm, which is

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
sort of the space
in which we are

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
having our human experience.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And I started working to
put the pieces together

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:90%
for how this pattern worked.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize
that my own discovery

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
process of energy and of
ether and of the nature

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of the universe itself
progressed through a sequence

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that I came to be
aware of was awakening

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
each one of my chakras,
one after another.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And each one of my
chakras I realized

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
was like a vibrational
energy structure

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
that connected to one aspect
of the physics of the universe

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomenology
of our experience.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And all this
was in that moment?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole thing happened
literally in less than

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:90%
a second, this huge vision.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But my translation of it,
and my understanding of it,

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and the journey through
that my chakras,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how each one of these
micro and macrocosmic layers

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:84%
fit to the chakra
understanding literally

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:90%
happened over three years.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I came to a state
of sort of mastery

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:90%
around it by the time I was 18.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to do my
senior project in high school

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
as The Unification of
Science and Spirituality

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Through Unified
Field Theoretics.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Ther-- no, theory?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Physics?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Theory of spirituality
connecting

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the dots between
different worlds?

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Basically.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, one more time.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the Unification of
Science and Spirituality

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Through Unified
Field Theoretics.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Through Unified
Field Theoretics.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's your paper.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:90%
When you were 18, you did.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I was in high school.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> In high school.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> My teachers thought,
what is this kid doing?

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
He's studying
graduate-level physics

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and integrating it with
spiritual traditions

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world and
trying to form a unified field

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
framework?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I got a high grade.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:90%
I got like a 96.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's great.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So not too bad.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Pretty good for a full
semester-long project.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And but to have that
inspiration in those--

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and ask those questions
at such a young age,

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
in your generation,
your time, you know--

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, nobody was
asking these questions.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I found myself with friends
that became like apprentices

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to me in high school, because
they wanted to learn what it

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:90%
was that I was learning.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds of
things are not--

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:84%
it was not just a
mental journey for me.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It was not just like
I'm going to figure out

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
how spacetime
works, and then I'll

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:90%
provide a theory to everyone.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
No, it was more like I was
experiencing reality showing me

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
a key.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
experiencing the universe

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
reflecting this key back to
me, miracles were happening.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Unlike some other scientists,
you had a unique perspective,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
because you started physically
having these experiences.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And the physical
experiences of connecting

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Chi and everything else
were helping feed the science.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The science was helping
feed the physical.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And you were--

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --on this path of
connecting those worlds.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd have
these friends that

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
were like what was that just
ha-- what did you just do?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
What just happened just now?

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start at the basics,
and I'd show them a ball of Chi,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and let them feel
it on their hand.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go like
dude, what is that?

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Like what did you just--

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we had that
at the conference.

00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:13.435 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You were teaching the
ba-- that same thing.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And just watching
everybody light up--

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and I've been most of my
life a martial artist.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So I've done Qigong
and Tai Chi and Bagua

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
martial arts that do that.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:90%
So I've had those lights go on.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But here you are,
super simplified--

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen it
presented in that way.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I've always done it
through this kind of stuff.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful
watching the light--

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the light up of these
people that experience it

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
That's just step one.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.007 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I got-- that was
my first step when I was 15.

00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing, though.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And so where you can go
from there is pretty awesome.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>> On a bigger
scale, what other--

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
what are some of
these other ways

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of your teaching, this--
these connecting the dots?

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned your
coming out here at Contact

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
in the Desert.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
I've been out speaking

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.798 align:middle line:84%
I first heard about you
in 2011 after seeing you

00:16:20.798 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
in Lightning in a Bottle.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I was so mesmerized.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I went online, and I started
seeing all the talks.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And you were talking at--

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
well, you've talked
at the White House.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
What really sucked me in was you
were talking about starships,

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:90%
holodecks, and--

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Replicators.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --replicators,
which I, you know,

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.247 align:middle line:84%
I'm a super hardcore Trekkie,
and grew up in that world.

00:16:46.247 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Gene Roddenberry's
a genius, by the way--

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> A genius.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.435 align:middle line:90%
>> --let me just say.

00:16:49.435 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were just like
going into it, and I was--

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I could see it.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I could-- I was--

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I got so inspired by your talks.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think it--
it felt like it was

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
at a university or something.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:90%
You were on stage.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And you had your presentation.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was a talk I
did at the University of North

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Carolina at
Asheville, Tech 2012--

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Starships, Replicators
and Energy Systems.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that was it.

00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I think I watched
that like five times.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And why aren't you like--

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
like president, or at
least up there in that--

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, you talked
so eloquently.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:90%
The information is solid.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
It's scientifically proven.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a lot of
the scientific community

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.648 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to
fully go there yet.

00:17:35.648 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But you are
connecting those dots.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it's taken a very
long time for the scientific

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
community to really
come on board.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And Nassim and I became friends
somewhere in the early 2000s,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:90%
2005, 2006.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And he, I felt like, was
the most on track of someone

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
who was really working out
the math and the science

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
of the physics, to be able to
start proving these things.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, I
also felt like he was

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:90%
missing a lot of the equation.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
certain aspects of what

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
this quantum gravitational
lattice looked like that I

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:90%
didn't hear him talking about.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't hear anybody
else talking about.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I really found
my own drive to do that work.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:10%
And I also realized that
one of the best ways

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to do it was through education,
because this project got me

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:10%
really thinking about
the importance of coming

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:10%
at education from a
more holistic manner.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:10%
And I began to
look at the process

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:10%
of learning from that framework,
and thinking about the fact

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:10%
that in order to really
grasp or master knowledge,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:10%
you need to have a
physical experience of it,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:10%
an emotional experience of
it, a mental experience of it.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to have shared
it with somebody.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You've got to learn how
to communicate about it.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And usually once you've
gotten through all of that,

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
you start to have higher-level
realizations and insights

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
about what it is that
you're seeking to learn.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And that realization that
the chakras and our--

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
literally our energetic
body's framework

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
is designed particularly to
learn by adapting information

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
from many different aspects of
our connection with everything,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
for how we can learn
holistically and integrate

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
all of the information that
we experience around us.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When and where
did the ET come in?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Because as we're here, you know,
talking to extra dimensionals,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
in your fine example of
this extra dimensional

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
construct that I'm
doing with my series.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.738 align:middle line:84%
>> (THICK ACCENT) We are all
very multi-dimensional beings.

00:19:49.738 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, we all are.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
So how did that--

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:90%
when did that come into play?

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd already, through my
explorations of science,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
known that we're not
alone, and that there are--

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be many,
many, many species out there.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I'd seen a few things
that definitely didn't appear

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:90%
to be human to me in the sky.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And so going to
Steven Greer's talk,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
meeting all of these people
who are taking this information

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
very seriously, and
they're investigating

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
these different
phenomena, and I began

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to become really
curious about it myself.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Even still, I didn't
have much to go with,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
besides here's people
disclosing this information.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's data.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But my personal
experiences were still

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
fairly limited to
just having seen

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:90%
a ship flying through the sky.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> At what point
in time did from--

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.605 align:middle line:84%
you go from realizing
that the U--

00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO phenomenon
is real, from obviously

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.695 align:middle line:84%
your experiences, but
just solidifying it with--

00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
it's a big thing,
a lot of people

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
are having new experiences, to
your actual contact experience?

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that was 2005.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And the bridge to get there
was the past-life experiences

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I started having in
2000 of Atlantis.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the first one.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in my
older friend's dorm room.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:10%
I was still in high
school at the time,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:10%
But he went to University
of North Carolina Asheville.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sitting
in his dorm room

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
with my other
friend, Charles Wu.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:10%
And the three of us were
kind of like brother magi

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:10%
who worked with each other
to integrate and explore

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:10%
a lot of these discoveries.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Each of them had
their own threads

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
on energy and metaphysics
and DNA and consciousness.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they were a great
sounding board for me

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to explore what I
was discovering,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and also for me to integrate
the insights and knowledge

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.682 align:middle line:90%
that they were gaining.

00:21:57.682 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting
in the dorm room.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about how it is
that manifestation happens,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:10%
and that it requires
a connection

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:10%
between a physical state
and an emotional state,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:10%
or an etheric vibration,
and a mental state,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:10%
or an astral construct, a
geometry that's vibrating,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:10%
and then a physical place where
that action can come through.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And boom, manifestation happens.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And as we come kind of to this
full-dialed, clear realization,

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
suddenly it was as if the
walls just disappeared.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're all standing in
this huge, huge temple,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:90%
massive crystal pillars.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're standing
around this crystal altar

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:90%
right in front of us.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're literally
storing these light codes

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
into this pillar, and
saving all of this knowledge

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
into this crystal
that's transmitting

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:90%
the energy down into the Earth.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And all three of us, as
we snapped back out of it,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.157 align:middle line:90%
we're like whoa, Atlantis.

00:23:05.157 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So the three of you had
just shared experience?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And we all had dreams
about it after that, too.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And the dreams involved
a lot more detail

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of people going
down to the ocean,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and there are going to be
giants tsunamis coming,

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:90%
and they were just surrendering.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Others had already
fled to the mountains,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:90%
and to the larger land masses.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And some of us were
in our temples,

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:84%
storing this knowledge
for the future away.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at this time,
I was about like 17.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I didn't
really know what

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:90%
to do with that information.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just another
data point, just

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
like all of the other
downloads and realizations.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I was just putting it
in my data library,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
like OK, maybe I was
alive in Atlantis.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I've never even thought
about reincarnation.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But I started to at
that point consider it.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you start getting
these other snippets of this

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:90%
reality of these past lives?

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
When did they start
coming through?

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so when
I was in college,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the times I was
sitting in the dorm room--

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and by this time, I'm dating
the roommate, I'll also say.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And this girl, Rachel,
who's sitting on her bed,

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
who's the one I felt the
strongest attraction to,

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I look over at her,
and all of a sudden,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a medieval ballroom.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And she has her
hair up in this bun,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and this elaborate,
beautiful dress.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I could smell the oil
lamps burning on the walls,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and the mustiness of
the tapestries hanging.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
pressure of my armor.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It was ornamental, like
ball-style armor, but still

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
armor, and the strap's pressure
on my body, ornamental sword

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:90%
at my side.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm discussing
with these two lords,

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, with
goatees and beards,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and their own like family
crests on their arm,

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
how to protect grain trade
between these two cities,

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
between our lands.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And we are figuring out
how to stop these brigands

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
from basically assaulting our
grain trains as they were going

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
through this particular
valley, and trying to stop

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:90%
the ambushes from happening.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
As I looked over
at her, I knew this

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
was like the love of my life.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the woman that
I wanted to be with.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And she's giggling and
laughing with her two ladies,

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and just every detail of
the feeling and the emotion

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of how deeply I loved her,
and how deeply I was connected

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to her, was right there.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm back
in the dorm room.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like
blinking, and looking

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.973 align:middle line:10%
at the two 18-year-old
kids I'm sitting with.

00:25:55.973 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:90%
They're looking at me.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And they say Adam, are you OK?

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, I
need some water.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:10%
So I get up.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:10%
I go out into the hall.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the water fountain
that's like out in the hall.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm drinking water, and
I'm just like, oh my god,

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:90%
what just happened to me?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And I go back into the room.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And inside the door,
there's bathrooms

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that are shared
between two dorm rooms.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And Rachel's in there
washing her face off.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I look at her, and
she looks up at me.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And she's like
did you-- did you?

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh
my god, you did too?

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I knew we'd
shared the experience.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I'm
dating her roommate.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.285 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beginning
of quite a challenging time

00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:44.085 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:26:44.085 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it sounds like
a nice whole episode.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
We could go off into many
episodes of this stuff.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:10%
And it was really just
the first trigger.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I then saw her across the
field in the middle of campus,

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and she became a Japanese woman
with a basket behind her head.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:10%
And I was a samurai in a mask
with my katana and wakizashi

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:10%
and my horse, watching
her walk to the village.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I knew her husband
was beating her.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this intense
pain around that.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
a Halloween party.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And we had a friend,
this guy John, who came.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And he gets really,
really drunk.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And neither-- none of us--

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I-- she and I didn't really
even know him that well.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.588 align:middle line:10%
And we hadn't told anybody
about our experiences,

00:27:25.588 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:10%
because I'm still trying to
break up with the roommate.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
This is all happening
really fast.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And he gets just wasted.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And he starts crying
and apologizing to me

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
for all of these crimes he did
against me in the Middle Ages.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And as he's saying it, I'm
remembering him taking her

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:84%
on his boat, and
basically seducing her,

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and then like dealing
with that backlash.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And she comes back to me.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And now he's coming to
my castle with an army

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:90%
to lay siege to my castle.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:90%
He's burning villages.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I stop it by getting him
to come in my courtyard

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and battle me
one-on-one to the death.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And we killed each other.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And I ended it--

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was
either going to die,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:84%
or I was going to kill
him and maybe die.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
exact way it happened.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember opening
up, just like this,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and letting his
sword go into my gut,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and then cutting him through,
and falling to the stones,

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and seeing her face crying,
and remembered leaving my body.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually seeing myself
laying there, and her,

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and having this experience
of crossing over

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:90%
into the spirit world.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.473 align:middle line:84%
And since he had no
idea any of these things

00:28:43.473 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that she and I
were going through,

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and he's calling us by
our names from that time,

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this was something
I had to take very seriously,

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:90%
and began to research myself.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And actually track it--

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
this was not just some
fantasy of liking a girl

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.645 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to be with her.

00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It was real memory of real
times and real emotions

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and real experiences that
I needed to deal with now.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you deal with that?

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.907 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Did you end up hooking
up with Rachel?

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of deep breaths.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
She and I ended
up being together

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:84%
some months after all of this,
and after the storm passed

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of breaking up
with her roommate.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:90%
They were best friends.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, us discovering
that they were both born

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:10%
on the exact same day
within hours of each other,

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:10%
and that the guy that I thought
that Rachel was into when

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:10%
we first started all hanging out
was born on the same day as me

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:10%
within a couple hours of me.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And as that synchronicity
surfaced, it all made sense.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:84%
We just kind of got
some wires crossed.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But that there was some deeper
purpose for us being together.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
Rachel and I--

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
we were together for
about 4 and 1/2 years--

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:84%
we experienced many, many,
many lifetimes of memory,

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and had to process through a
lot of karmas with each other,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and with people that were
coming into our lives

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and remembering us, or that
we would remember them.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And started to rebuild
this sort of soul family

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
at a really deep
level, where many of us

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:84%
had been together
lifetime after lifetime,

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and needed to find each
other again now-- sometimes

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.140 align:middle line:84%
to resolve things, and
other times really just

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to gain that level of depth
of connection and knowledge

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:90%
of each other.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because it
was-- if it was just you,

00:30:47.565 --> 00:30:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be able to
get that full realization.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to have somebody
to reflect off of, right?

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Or several people, in the
sense of the other friend.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You need data.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You need data if
you're good to trans--

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
what I came to
understand is I was

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:90%
doing transpersonal psychology.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And in transpersonal
psychology, you need data.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember exactly what
happened to me in kindergarten.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:10%
But if I hang out
with a friend who

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:10%
I went to kindergarten
with, we could

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.867 align:middle line:10%
talk about kindergarten
all day, because we'll

00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:10%
remember the different
things that we went through

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:10%
at that time--

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Bounce it off of each other.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>> With each other, yeah.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:22.980 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went on a
journey for many years,

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:84%
integrating these past-life
memories and aspects of myself.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And that journey led me through
a lot of amazing experiences,

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:10%
including holding sacred fire
ceremony with indigenous elders

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:10%
from around the world to doing
the Prayer Runs for World

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:10%
Peace with Arvol Looking
Horse and his family,

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:10%
and helping his
daughter organize those.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And that journey to the
Black Hills of South Dakota,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
the first Prayer Run
for World Peace in 2005,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:90%
led me to the west coast.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And that got me to go to
Burning Man for the first time.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm experiencing
this space that

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most incredible
expressions of human creativity

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.780 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Just every aspect
of the city is built

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
from somebody's
imagination, and created

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
into this amazing temple
or play space or whatever.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And it can be anything
you could imagine.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
So there's Greek temples.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:90%
There's old Japanese tea rooms.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:10%
There's spaces from different
cultures and time periods,

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:10%
you know, whiskey piano
bars with cowboys.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And talk about an
amazing space to work

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
with how your
consciousness integrates

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
many different
aspects of yourself

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and many different times.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And this led to the night
of the burn, where the man

00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:90%
himself is burned.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And everybody runs around the
man, and just huge parties.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing experience.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But I went into
that night knowing

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that there were some
deeper symbolic nature

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to this burning of the man.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to make it a
spiritual journey that night,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and to really, really go to
the fire as a spiritual fire,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and run and dance
around the fire,

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and chant and practice my inner
work, develop my inner energy,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and to use that as the fuel
of the magic for my experience

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:90%
that night.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Where many people would be
just like taking heavy drugs

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:84%
or getting drunk
or doing whatever,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted it to be
the peak of my experience.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to be as clear
and as grounded and as totally

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:90%
present as possible.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to meeting
my mother and father

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:90%
from the age of Atlantis.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I walked back to my camp
after the man had burned.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been in this
shamanic state of chanting.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was in this very deep
state of stillness in myself.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And he walks, my father walks
into the camp at the same time.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's somebody that I knew.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But as he approaches
the camp, I see him

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and know him as my father.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this
deep, ancient forest.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And he has slightly
pointed ears,

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and looks kind of half elven.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I do too,
and that this is my father.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we see
each other, we just know.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.449 align:middle line:90%
Both of us instantly know.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And we hug each other.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was this deep,
powerful, potent hug.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:84%
This led to a process
where he and I went

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
about clearing this
karma with my mother

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis, who
interestingly enough,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:84%
we both realized was
a woman that we'd

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
interacted with separately
and individually

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:90%
on the playa that year.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But we both knew
who exactly it was.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And as we went through
this journey of healing

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:84%
this relationship with her,
and the attachments that she

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:84%
had with us, the cables
that she had placed on us

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:84%
or in us to try to keep us
aligned to the family mission

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that we had at that
time, and broke away

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from that, the pain
of that breakaway

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
was somehow still there
among us, the three of us.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The gentleman who represented
your father and hugged you,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.370 align:middle line:84%
did he also again have
this shared experience?

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:90%
He knew that he was my father.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And we both knew
immediately that we just

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:84%
had this memory in order to
clear this karma with my mother

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:90%
from that time.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.453 align:middle line:90%
>> So we sought out to find her.

00:35:50.453 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that night?

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That night.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we did next.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> After you had your bro-hug?

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It's time.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's go find Mom, and
let's clear some stuff.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, so we go to the places
where we thought she might be.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
We even had her like
water bag with us.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't there.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up just kind of
heading out into the playa,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:84%
because we felt like
maybe she's there

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
at that fireplace
in the distance.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a lot of
people converging there.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's go there.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And on the way, we started
talking through the healing

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:90%
process--

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.168 align:middle line:84%
the releasing of the
attachments, the why we--

00:36:27.168 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:84%
why we needed to go, and
why we needed to leave her,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and where the pain had come
from, and energetically

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.350 align:middle line:84%
started working with the field
of where and how in our bodies

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:84%
this pain was
stored in both of us

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:90%
that we both felt really deeply.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And we found that this
giant fire sculpture

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that we were heading towards
out in the middle of the desert

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.670 align:middle line:90%
was a massive phoenix.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.400 align:middle line:10%
And it was the wings
of a phoenix coming up

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:10%
and the belly of a phoenix.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:10%
And she wasn't there.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:10%
And we decided that we were
going to leave the water there.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
finally drops the thing.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:90%
We're going to let go, done.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.350 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is enough.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
carry this anymore.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:90%
This is the final step.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's put this with the fire.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And we left her stuff
there with the fire,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and walked out of the
phoenix, and sort of

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.272 align:middle line:84%
were reflecting on
the healing experience

00:37:22.272 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:90%
that we'd been through.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But I still felt like
this deep, hollow space,

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:84%
like as if I'd just gutted
a bunch of old funk out

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of my body or my system, and
now I was like empty and hungry,

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and as if there is a
hole in my auric field.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And he felt the same way.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And we found ourselves
walking towards

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful sculpture
set of a mother, who

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:84%
had fire pouring
out of her hands,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.060 align:middle line:84%
into the hand of an
upstretched child.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we just went before
this beautiful mother altar.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I went down on the ground,
and put my head on the ground.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, I was
going into the earth.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And I felt Gaia.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I felt the mother of the
planet, and the infinite mother,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the true mother enfolding
me and wrapping me in light.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And she just literally filled
up my entire body with energy.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.040 align:middle line:84%
She filled all the holes,
patched all the wounds.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I'd somehow
taken this false replacement

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of my mother, that was my
first human mother, as I

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:90%
would come to discover--

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:84%
with-- with-- I'd
somehow put her

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
in the way of my connection
to this Gaia mother,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and this deeper mother.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And not permanently,
but it was--

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:84%
there was some piece
there that was cut off.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I had this
experience, I heard

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
her voice say get up, and run
back through my footsteps.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.225 align:middle line:90%
And I get up off the ground.

00:38:57.225 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Willie, he
looks at me, and we're like--

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and we both hear it.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
We stand up.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And we run around her.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And we start running
through the desert,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that she
had flaming footsteps laid

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:84%
into the playa that was
part of this art piece.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And as I ran back
through the footsteps,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I became very, very
aware of the fact

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that I'd had this journey
through time from Atlantis,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and to now, and I was thrown
into these memories of how

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I had moved through
all of these lifetimes,

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and how I had faced these major,
intense moments of struggle

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and pain, of killing someone,
or almost being killed.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And had to come to a
place of reconciliation

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:90%
around all of it.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And in that process
of getting there,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was something
before Atlantis, something

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to discover.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And the only way I
could discover that

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:10%
was to go out into the middle
of the desert on my own.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.420 align:middle line:10%
So I run out into the middle
of the desert by myself.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I leave Will.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:90%
We're cool.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.500 align:middle line:84%
He's got his own
journey to go on.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm running, I start
experiencing my partner's body

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:84%
as my own body,
this woman that I

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.080 align:middle line:84%
had been on this
lifetime journey

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:90%
with through Earth's lifetimes.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm experiencing her as me.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And she's not there, of course.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:84%
She's sleeping in her bed in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And yet later, months later
after this experience,

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
she was dreaming that she
was in the desert with me,

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and having this
experience with me.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And we come to this art
piece, which was like a prism,

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and a rainbow of light
coming out of the ground.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
I was just guided.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything was
like guidance right now.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just do what you
know you're supposed to do.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So I go, and I stick
my head in this thing.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I'm in
the Sirian Star System,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that I'd had
a dream about in high school,

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.160 align:middle line:90%
where there was two sons.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had a house
and an observatory.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there, sitting in the
observatory, where you could--

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.160 align:middle line:84%
even with the brightness of the
sun's sky, in the observatory,

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:84%
you could see the different star
patterns through the ceiling.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting across from her.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are literally
weaving our chakras together

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:84%
like a DNA strand,
forming a bond

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to get ready to travel
to another planet,

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and leave our bodies.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to die, and go and
incarnate in another world.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And that world is Earth.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm seeing
this weaving happen,

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:57.250 align:middle line:84%
we both decide that it's
time to unweave this knot.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:10%
It's time to let this bond
go that we came to this world

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:10%
with, this contract that
had somehow bound us,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:10%
to help us remember who we are,
and to remember each other,

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:10%
and to remember why we came.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I began
seeing an unweave--

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're sitting
across from each other--

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.340 align:middle line:90%
unweaving this field.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it releases--
and I'm saying I free you.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.720 align:middle line:90%
I free you, Ristar Amarisa.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I free you.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And speaking to
her all these names

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that I had remembered of
these different lives.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing her speaking
my names across lives.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And as it releases, suddenly
it was like [WHIRRING]..

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had all these
flashes of her memories

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
as a woman across all of
these different times--

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:84%
as a geisha, and as a
priestess, and in her services,

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and in her work, and
in her inner self,

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and as a mother bearing a
child, and all these flashes

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:90%
of being a woman.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And she, in that dream, at home,
got all these downloads of me,

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and her as me-- as a man,
as a warrior, as a king,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.850 align:middle line:84%
as a leader, as a sage,
doing all of the things

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that I had done.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And along with all of those
downloads of Earth memories,

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I became unshakably
clear about the fact

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:90%
that I was a Sirian ambassador.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I was from another star system.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered quite clearly
having a ton of my friends

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and family from
different worlds all

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.360 align:middle line:84%
planning to go to
Earth together,

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and making this pact
that we're going,

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:90%
we're gonna meet up there.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's the middle of
the Ice Age on Earth.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And this civilization
is building up.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And technology is building up.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Culture is building up.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.900 align:middle line:90%
A renaissance is happening.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that it was possible
that in this time on Earth,

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
people could make
a leap to becoming

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:90%
part of our galactic community.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It was the greatest show
to be part of on Earth.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:59.740 align:middle line:84%
We all wanted to come in and to
help that process and support

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.800 align:middle line:84%
humanity in making
that great transition.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.918 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I
came to this planet.

00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So at that time, the vision
you were seeing was sort

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of a potential of us having
that galactic connection at that

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:90%
time?

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Which I guess it sounds like
we did, to a certain extent.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We did, to an extent.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>> But--

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> But not fully?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --we didn't make the
leap of having full galactic

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
technologies, and actually
having humanity join the rest

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.920 align:middle line:90%
of this council of species.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The Earth wasn't
ready for it yet.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I look at that time as the
fall of the Tower of Babel,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:37.090 align:middle line:84%
where we're trying to reach
the gods, so to speak.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's not some anger of
an angry guy trying to cash--

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:84%
cast people back
down to their place.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It's much more like
Gaia's energetic body

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%
just simply wasn't ready.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it as her
throat chakra blowing open.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And that opening for her meant
lots of new water, and also

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.450 align:middle line:84%
lots of new communication
and languages,

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and going deeper into the
understanding and the communion

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:08.582 align:middle line:84%
with the lands that was
required for the people to do.

00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Because there were so
many people coming in who

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
were star beings
from other worlds,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and they hadn't had the time
to really get to know her.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us chose
to stay, of course,

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.820 align:middle line:90%
after that cataclysm.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And sort of go through
the next cycle, going deeper,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.660 align:middle line:90%
connecting--

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> All the way to now.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> All the way to now--

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:90%
fascinating.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:10%
So to actually
have those visions,

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:10%
to have those experiences, to
relive those emotions, what

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.440 align:middle line:10%
was it like when you were
feeling those emotions to come

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle line:10%
here, but then you must have
at some point realized that--

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:54.070 align:middle line:10%
I hate to use the word failed,
but that that point in time,

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.812 align:middle line:10%
that Atlantian time when we--

00:45:55.812 --> 00:45:57.520 align:middle line:10%
you know, if your
mission is to come here

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.550 align:middle line:10%
to connect to our
galactic family,

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:10%
and whoops we didn't quite--
we connected, but not really.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And here we are,
26,000 years later--

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>> 13.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> 13,000 years later, going
now we're getting to do it,

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and that's it.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't feel a
sense of failure.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:90%
I felt my god, it's time now.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
go and make contact.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I was now standing in
the middle of the desert.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I've just freed a soul
bond with a soul partner

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.730 align:middle line:90%
that I've had for 13,000 years.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I have memory of who I am
as a galactic ambassador.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for me to go
have a talk with my family,

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and find out what's
the schedule?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Where we at?

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.915 align:middle line:90%
Is it time or what?

00:46:47.915 --> 00:46:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard this
about Sirians.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.563 align:middle line:90%
I heard that they--

00:46:50.563 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, this coming
through, at least around where

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:56.310 align:middle line:84%
the channelings are at,
they have the patience, more

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.430 align:middle line:84%
patience than any other
star system out there.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And they like to watch the grass
grow, so they say, you know.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Or not like to, but they can.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They have no problem
watching the grass grow.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.602 align:middle line:84%
>> So you guys have the patience
to sit 13,000 years and sort

00:47:09.602 --> 00:47:10.830 align:middle line:90%
of see it come through.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
now about things?

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you sing long enough to a
tree, it will become your home.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a saying that we
have in the Sirian System.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that the time
cycle was essential,

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
for all of us that
had come here,

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:84%
to really get to know
this beautiful library

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.300 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness that is Earth.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And without having had
that time, who knows?

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I would never really
know humanity.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, so many of
these star species

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that came in, whether from the
Sirian System or the Pleiades

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:84%
or the Arcturian
System, or Helios

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:90%
or from the Yahoian System--

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:55.560 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
star people that came here,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it also gave them an
opportunity to get

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to know each other
as the same species,

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:84%
on one world where you don't
have a ship that you can just

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.160 align:middle line:90%
go bail.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, if things
get tough, right--

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, if things get tough--

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:08.045 align:middle line:90%
>> --you gotta work it out.

00:48:08.045 --> 00:48:09.175 align:middle line:90%
>> --you gotta face it.

00:48:09.175 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:90%
You gotta face the truth.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So that-- it sounds
like having those--

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.600 align:middle line:84%
again, going to this full
package of, you know,

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Adam's theory of everything,
the unified field, now you're

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:84%
connecting in past
life emotions,

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:28.230 align:middle line:84%
not just the current life
emotions, past life emotions,

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:32.340 align:middle line:90%
geometry, frequency, vibration--

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, the whole
gamut of things.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to now connect
the dots through the chakra

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
systems connecting
to the colors,

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the emotions.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I came to find in
the years following this night

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
that I had that night,

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that so much of my knowledge
was knowledge I had brought from

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:90%
other worlds.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been keeping
this library for much

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:04.410 align:middle line:84%
longer than I could remember,
even across galactic lifetimes,

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and been a teacher
of it, and used

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
it to develop new technologies--
starship engines and piloting

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always felt
like there was some call

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.700 align:middle line:84%
to doing higher
technology development,

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.450 align:middle line:84%
beyond website
building and branding.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But that night was
also a gateway to what

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.820 align:middle line:90%
that might actually look like.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I went deeper into the desert.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And I found--

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So the same night?

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> The same night.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found an art piece that I
knew for some reason was there

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:90%
for me to do this work with.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And the art piece looked like
a pyramid, from a distance,

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.620 align:middle line:84%
with a light shooting
out the top of it.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But as I got closer to it,
I realized it was a cone,

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and it had laser light
projecting stars rotating

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and swirling around it.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So it looked like a
transparent vortex of stars

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.110 align:middle line:84%
going up and then
shooting into the sky.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Stargate temple,
perhaps, anyone?

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And went inside this space,
and began a process inside

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.400 align:middle line:90%
of this space of seeing--

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I began to really use
the space outside of me

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as a mirror of what
I was trying to do

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.290 align:middle line:90%
inside my own consciousness.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And inside this space, there
was a certain lighting pattern

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.540 align:middle line:90%
going on in the ceiling.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell immediately
that this lighting pattern was

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:35.850 align:middle line:84%
somehow being manifested
by these two discs, control

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.010 align:middle line:90%
panels that were in the space.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And that while there was light
coming from both of them,

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.050 align:middle line:84%
one was cut off from the rest
of the entire light network that

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:48.090 align:middle line:90%
was above me in the space.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that that was a
symbolic mirror of our star

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.820 align:middle line:84%
system, and our
experience here on Earth,

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and how we feel so separated
from everything else out there.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet all around us
is life in communication

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and in connection.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I set out to fix this
problem inside this space

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.310 align:middle line:84%
as a metaphysical
practice to actually

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.310 align:middle line:84%
engaging the communication
between our worlds

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and these other
species out there.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long story
of how this went down.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But it involved basically
toning to these control panels

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
with other people that came
into the space with me.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And through doing that,
we reactivated them,

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and a series of
downloads happened.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And other people came
in at the right moment.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And in this process, we
finally built a bridge

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:90%
between these light networks.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of static,
linear, human way of thinking

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:53.010 align:middle line:84%
found a bridge to the
rotational, cyclical,

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.650 align:middle line:84%
synchronistic sort
of way of thinking

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.740 align:middle line:90%
that the galaxy embodies.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally
sitting there,

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at this last piece of
light show up in the space.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting with
a guy who said to me,

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:13.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, right
now in my life, I

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:84%
feel like I've done
everything, and anything

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.080 align:middle line:90%
could happen right now.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Anything could happen,
and I'd be open to it.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And the download I
got from that was

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.410 align:middle line:84%
wow, I wonder how many
people are like that,

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.270 align:middle line:84%
where they just are
tired of their lives.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They're tired of what's
happened to them,

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and anything could happen.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And what if it's
that openness, what

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:41.170 align:middle line:84%
if it's just that little
piece of I'm open to anything

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:46.080 align:middle line:84%
right now that's needed
for us to make contact?

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I smiled at him,
and I looked up.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman
standing in the space study.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking at me, but
she was not human (ECHOING)

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:90%
not human not human.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:54:08.000 align:middle line:90%
