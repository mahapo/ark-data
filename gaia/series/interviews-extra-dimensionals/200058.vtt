00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:10%
The way it works for me when
I channel for people is I

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:10%
will repeat the first four,
five, six words that I hear.

her name was Julie at
the time I met her.

And she was a Kundalini
yoga teacher and a shaman.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:10%
And I went to her
for some yoga lessons

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:10%
and some of her
shamanic sessions,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:10%
and thought she was great.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:10%
And a few friends at the time
who were spiritually open,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:10%
I would read for them.

coffee, and you'd

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:10%
be talking about something,
and I would hear things,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:10%
and get stalked by

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:10%
doesn't happen anymore,
didn't happen as soon

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But I would be hounded
by this information.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.142 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, hey, Ruben, I've
got some things coming through.

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I'd give you the information.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And usually it
always helped people.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me
and said, hey, what

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
you said to me
about my boyfriend

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and I really put us back on
track in our relationship.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:90%
You should do this.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I've got a newsletter
list of 300 people.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow, 300 people.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I'll
send it out to them.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Could you do it for the public?

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, well, maybe.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if they sent me three
questions I could try.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.123 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I was
doing it for myself.

00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I would go home
every night, and I

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.372 align:middle line:90%
would ask questions of the Zs.

00:05:48.372 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I would write down
these questions,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
write their answers.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So it started almost in
an automatic writing--

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> --type of--

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:10%
>> --situation.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>> So your three
questions would come like,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:10%
should I move to Japan?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:10%
I've got this thing going
on, and can you give me--

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and literally I would get
about 2,000 words on average.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.317 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes it was like 2,500--

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:09.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Just from three questions?

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:10.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes it was like 1,000.

00:06:10.817 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so usually
about 600, 700 words.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And that would
take me 90 minutes.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd kind of just be writing
constantly for an hour.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.562 align:middle line:84%
And then I do a grammar sweep
and additional sentences that

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
would come in the second way.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sending
these to people.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And then after about
a year I decided

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to go to telephone and to Skype.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And initially I hated
the telephone and Skype.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It made me more nervous.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But that was how I started
verbally channeling for people.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So the questions brought
through the channeling

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:90%
in a way?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, twofold actually.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I learned-- you know,
it's really hard for me

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to remember the very
first ones that I

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
did on telephone and Skype
because it's 14 years ago.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But the way I would
work with people

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in the last kind of
eight years, I guess,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is you would call me or
appear on Skype video.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I'd know your name.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would, for the
first 30 minutes,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
not in Zs channeling
mode, just as myself,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you about
your past, present,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and future for about 25
minutes, just like a monologue.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd ask
me some questions.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.523 align:middle line:84%
And then usually, in my more
recent sessions, the Zs,

00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I would bring in for
like the last 10 minutes,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
just to give a kind of
high-frequency ending

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and overview.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's all connected
for me anyway.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I go into
intuitive mode, I

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
know they're, like,
feeding the top.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I'm dealing
with the kind of middle layers.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.108 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I got really
passionate about that.

00:07:46.108 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw so many people,
with channeling, floating off.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had those
experiences myself, too.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Channeling could--

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Floating off.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Floating off.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd see people float
out of the channeling room,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and not know what to do with it.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So for example, an hour of
a channel, they're like, ah,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of
float out of the room.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they crash
down a few days later,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
how to apply it.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I see, I see.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:10%
>> So for me, after a while, I
got passionate about the middle

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:10%
ground.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, well here's
some of the higher-frequency

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply that to our
human patterns and programming?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Because that was also
my query and path.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
And so that was how I
became what me and my team

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
refer to as an energy
intuitive, where you're really

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
just intuitively reading energy
and translating it for people,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
which I think has been
one of my main jobs

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
for the last 10 years, and that
work, really being an energy

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
translator, giving language
to the energetic of things.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's sort of
goal with this series,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:84%
is to take all this channeled
material collectively,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and then, through this
interview process,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
sort of step it down a
couple notches for people

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Because sometimes it is--

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:90%
it just hit you.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.675 align:middle line:84%
And it feels good, and
you're like, oh, yeah.

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But how do you integrate
that into your life?

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:90%
So I definitely-- I can relate.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm on the same page there.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So, well, now you're
in the States.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
this transition.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:10%
So how long did you do this work
in England, and coming here?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:10%
>> So I began this work in 2004.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And then in 2006, I had
a partner-- a channeler

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:10%
and an author-- and we
were partners in life

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and in work for three years.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to move to
the states together around 2008

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
but then he decided
it wasn't for him.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And around the same
time, we split.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was brought to the
States in 2009 to do a retreat

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and I was taken to
Boulder, Colorado.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was so in the
middle of the split

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.075 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I got to
Boulder, it was like,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're supposed
to move here alone.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to move to Boulder.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And that will be
your landing pad.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So I finally made
that happen by 2012.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It took a few years
of coming back.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I got a visa,
and moved here in 2012.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was so funny, a woman--

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I was in Costco of
all places, in the UK,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:90%
when I was 20 years old.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was at drama school.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:10%
I was completing what had been
a pretty successful childhood

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:10%
with acting.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:10%
That was kind of like
a skill I really had.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:10%
I could shamanically
transform into other people.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:90%
I was a character actor.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.212 align:middle line:90%
But I was bored of acting.

00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:10%
It's like it had been the
thing I was really good at.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But I already knew,
going to drama school,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.965 align:middle line:84%
I was going to have
to do other things.

00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to direct film.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And this woman in
Costco stopped me.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And she was she was handing
out samples of food.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was at the
end of this aisle.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It was like ice cream.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would
you like to try this?

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.573 align:middle line:90%
And we were just chatting.

00:10:52.573 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:90%
She was lovely.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK, I
need to stop you now.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm an intuitive.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell
you something.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was like rabbit
in the headlights,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.485 align:middle line:84%
because this was
before the channeling.

00:11:04.485 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're going
to live in America.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, England is
too small for you.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling is too low.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
very well in America.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're going to go.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:10%
So I immediately-- I walked
away and was in shock,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.648 align:middle line:10%
and translated that film.

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:10%
I was like, oh, well, there's
a lot of film in America.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe--

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%
But I kind of forgot about it.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, years
later, I remembered,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
just after I got
my visa, not only

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I've moved
here, but that, interestingly,

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.845 align:middle line:84%
Americans were 50% of the people
who were following my work.

00:11:36.845 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Even at that time.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was kind of logical
that I kind of ended up here.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.753 align:middle line:90%
But I felt good when I was here.

00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing about
being here that I don't like

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
is I miss my family, and I miss
some of my friends in England.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the cost of living
in this place for me.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you find in America
that there's more openness

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to this idea of
channel material,

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
intuitive psychic phenomena
and these kinds of things?

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think,
like anywhere, there

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.222 align:middle line:90%
are people who are not into it.

00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's something in
the ground here as well.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I think mysticism in
England is strong.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But not so much in the
last 100 or so years.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I think "Harry Potter" is
great, because it's kind of--

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that phenomenon has
brought back and re-owned

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
some of England's
history around mysticism.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, America just seems
a little more open to it.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
about the land here.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There are some really hot
spots in America, energy-wise,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.647 align:middle line:84%
that I think help
support that whole thing.

00:12:37.647 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I've noticed this, too.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:90%
I spent some time in Japan.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:90%
My wife's Japanese.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And even though they have
this ancient history, culture

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of mysticism, monsters,
and creatures,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and just out-there stuff,
as far as them embracing,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about channeling
or psychic phenomenon

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
in general, they're
very standoffish of it.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like,
oh no, that's fake.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
This is real, that's fake.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, what
about all your history

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and your-- well, that's fake.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, it
wasn't fake back then.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.067 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just curious, in
England, is that the same?

00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it might
be a little similar.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.538 align:middle line:90%
>> I think to some degree.

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I haven't lived
in England for six years.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:10%
So I don't feel
like a great person

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:10%
to talk about it right now.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Just because a lot's
happened in six years.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing that I
noticed that is something--

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:90%
there's something I see.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:10%
I feel like because of
the culture in America

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:10%
that, again, has changed
in the last decade.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But there's a culture
in America of you

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
can be anything, do
anything, and there is, like,

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:90%
a support of that.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.068 align:middle line:90%
>> An acceptance of it.

00:13:52.068 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And in England, there is a
great suspicion around that,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same in Japan.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right?

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, same in Japan.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, don't get
too big for your boots.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:10%
So there's a kind
of auto-clampdown

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:10%
that happens in the
English culture around too

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:10%
much in the way of
emotion, expression.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, a great irony,
because England

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
has this rich cultural history
around emotion and expression.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think all of
that's changing.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel
that if America was

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
the leader for this kind
of stuff for a while,

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I feel that things are beginning
to balance out a little bit

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:90%
That's my perception of it.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, definitely something
around the clamp in England.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about channeling,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:90%
it's not about a clamp at all.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It's about opening the clamp.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's about
letting something in.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a kind of
suspicion or fear in England

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:90%
that's very specific.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And that goes with Japan, too.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Having lived in Japan, a lot
of people there even compare it

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to England because of
the size of the country,

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
sort of island
countries in a way,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of isolated from
the big continents.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And yeah, I'm just finding
now these similarities in this

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, hm, I wonder--
there's more similarities than--

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:10%
We've had a few lovely
Japanese participants

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:10%
at workshops who have either
flown to Norway to do workshops

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:10%
I've done, or other places
around the world I've

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:10%
held workshops.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.115 align:middle line:84%
And they're really pro,
like, please come to Japan.

00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:90%
We need more of this.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:90%
So I hear that a lot.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, excellent.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I will one day go to Japan.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I might be able to help.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk after.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:10%
So getting back to
the actual process--

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:10%
so now, because you
said you do a mixture

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:10%
of almost channeling slash
intuitive readings, or--

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I do less channeling
these days than ever.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:10%
But I'm a big believer
that channeling should

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:10%
be part of a balanced diet.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:10%
So like anything, you know,
it's like if you just do yoga

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:10%
as your exercise,
your body is going

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:10%
to be missing other things.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of do that in my work.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:90%
We bring in music.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I work intuitively with
people around their patterns.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I bring in as a
kind of grace note, too.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, a few different ways.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I noticed that.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
We first met at the channel
panel a couple years ago.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I sort of did a little
research on, who's this guy?

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
He's got-- you know, I loved
your channel at that time,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:90%
with the Zs.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But then I'd
noticed you do offer

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
so much more like
a complete package

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
the channeler, Lee.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You're-- you know,
you do all this stuff,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:90%
which is quite cool.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I think it's needed.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's interesting.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like channeling
opened me up in a certain way,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and enhanced my intuition.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It enhanced my
understanding of creativity.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big believer
in creativity,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.825 align:middle line:84%
because since I was
little, creativity

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
has been a part of my life.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things I love to teach

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
people to remember as well.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the whole smorgasbord,
which is really what channeling

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Channeling, to me, is evidence
of our multi-dimensionality.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm curious about how
we become more multi-dimensional

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
as humans, and find the
balance point for ourselves.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all different,
but there are key things

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:90%
we all need.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:10%
>> You said you sort
of started as an actor,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:10%
which I know Nora also
has an acting background.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.765 align:middle line:84%
I know another
channeler who we'll

00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
be interviewing
in the future who

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:90%
also has an acting background.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Darryl Anka, who
channels Bashar,

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is in the entertainment
industry, not necessarily

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%
an actor.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
He's more of the artist.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
How do you see
those comparisons?

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Shamanism.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Shamanism.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's from the
acting as shamanism.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.655 align:middle line:90%
Can you go into that?

00:17:48.655 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I can.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I just speak
about myself personally,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a very strong
self identity as a kid.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Which is not uncommon
with intuitives,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:90%
empaths, sensitive people.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
lending yourself

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
out to so many different
places because you don't

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
know how to be or where to be.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
gift of acting was

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
who I was, but I

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
knew how to be this old
man who's having a really--

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
I could shape-shift.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, and I wasn't--

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
even though I got a
lot of lead roles,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
it was always as a character.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I was never the lead.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You look at someone like Tom
Cruise, who basically it's

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.315 align:middle line:84%
a persona and a personality that
he recycles from role to role.

00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:90%
I was the opposite of that.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have been Tom
Cruise if you paid me.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:90%
But I could be the weirdest--

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
it didn't make sense
what I was able to do.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So to me, there's this
great quote about acting.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And it says the theater
is an empathy gym.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long quote,
but it's basically

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:84%
talking about the troupe of
actors and the storyteller,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and the director
concoct this thing

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have
an energetic effect

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:90%
on the audience.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And you take that ride
together every night.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So I did a play in
2014 in Boulder,

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.548 align:middle line:90%
in the Fringe Festival.

00:19:12.548 --> 00:19:13.965 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
first time I'd done

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:90%
a play in about five years.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And while I loved
doing it, what I

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
remembered that I
really loved doing

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:90%
about it was the community.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It was like I love being in
the wings with fellow actors.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
I love rehearsing.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:29.248 align:middle line:84%
The show itself is great,
but it's over in an hour.

00:19:29.248 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all the other stuff.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So for me, what acting really
grounded me in, I think,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that I now look at is, I
didn't know this at the time,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
but I was really good at
that audience relationship.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was coming from an
empathic intuitive standpoint.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I realized
I was so successful on stage

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is because I knew how to ride
the wave of the connection

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
between me and the audience, and
modify it from night to night.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.665 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're a bit more muted?

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now we take it down.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:10%
And so for me, when
I look back now,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:10%
I think that was part of
my success with theater.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:10%
And it was the first
place that taught

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:10%
me the language of an energy
exchange between an audience

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:10%
and storytellers.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I feel the same thing
now in a workshop room.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like I can feel
the heart of the room,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and I know when to slow it
down, when to speed it up,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
when they want a bit more
so that you can direct

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing to kind
of move or open an audience,

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:90%
open a room.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.398 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, which is-- but
you've stripped away

00:20:37.398 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:90%
the story and the script.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You're just working
with what's there.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit more raw.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.955 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm used to it.

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to
go back to a script.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But at first it's a bit like,
oh my God, I'm walking in here,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
talk for an hour,

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
I'm going to say.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just got used
to that, you know?

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was so iconic--

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
the last channel panel we did--

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Rob put together was in the
theater, just the one chair,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:90%
spotlight on the--

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It was kind of
like, oh, this is--

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:90%
he we are.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:90%
We're in theater.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And that can have a
negative connotation,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I guess, depending
how you look at it.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I think this is part of our
human story as storytellers.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people,
well, he's just acting,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:90%
or they're just acting.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And they just throw it out
there like, well, they're

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:90%
just actors.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> But you know what's funny
about that is there is no way

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:84%
in hell I would give such a bad
performance as a channeler if I

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
was acting.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning I could do
a way better accent,

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I could do a way better voice.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:90%
I could be a much more--

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what I mean?

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Like, seriously.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.422 align:middle line:84%
And that was the kind of
thing that was kind of tricky.

00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
some very theatrical

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
channelers out there,
which is kind of

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
entertaining in its own right if
you're into that kind of thing.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, for me,
that's the irony.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I first saw
myself channeling on video--

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:90%
or heard myself--

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
it was embarrassing.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like-- you know,
it was kind of weird to me.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what I would
have manipulated.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I would have manipulated
something a bit more a bit more

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
interesting or a bit more
different than it is.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But you can't-- you
could manipulate it,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.167 align:middle line:90%
but then you would lose the--

00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
you would not be
surrendering to the essence

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:90%
of what comes through.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:90%
So no, I totally--

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I've had that
thought many times.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly I kind
of don't care, because--

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, at this point,
we have to just you know--

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because me too, as an
actor, I get the same thing.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm the post-- oh, look at
this actor, is this really--

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm like--

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and that's because
people have a misconception

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:90%
about acting, too.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Because good acting is truth.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And people believe
that acting is pretend.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And actually I could point
out some pretend performances

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
from actors, and they
wouldn't move you

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the way that those who are
really tapping into something

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like an actor
is running something

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.918 align:middle line:84%
through their system for
the benefit of the story.

00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
If they're faking
it, there's nothing

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
running through their system.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel that.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's face acting
versus feeling acting.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and using techniques
and things to just sort of get

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
by, and get through
the scene or whatever.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:20.085 align:middle line:84%
But what I think you really
hit on, which maybe even later,

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the Zs, when they come through,
we can talk about this.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
This has sort of been
the theme, and I think

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
this is the theme of today is--

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I say the theme in
my research and where

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going with all this is
this really is about story.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Our entire reality
is about story.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think we get so
caught up in the story we

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:90%
forget that it's a story.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It feels like that's
what's happening now,

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
this time we're in.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I almost-- it was a
dinner conversation last night

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
with some other actors.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And I almost-- maybe I
channeled this, I don't know.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I said-- because they
were getting all upset

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:90%
about the political arena.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how does
that really affect you?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's just a
story you're watching on TV.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- like, in your
life, is there really anything

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that is directly affecting you?

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.017 align:middle line:84%
Name one thing that
connects this story

00:24:18.017 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that you see on TV, and the
political situation, and all

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:84%
this thing that it can
actually affect you.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't do that.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us, if
we really break it down,

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
we're just buying into these
stories that we're fed.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And then we're reenacting them.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the art of
storytelling is so important.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's, instead of tune
into that message,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.872 align:middle line:84%
let's tune into a message from
some higher vibrational beings

00:24:43.872 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:10%
That's a way better story
than listening to the news

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:10%
and what's going on in our
political arenas right now.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:10%
And all of our stories
intersect so differently,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:10%
which is mind-blowing, isn't it?

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:10%
When you really
think about it, it's

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:10%
kind of usually the
key in a disagreement.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you said this.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:90%
No, I was saying this.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But in those two
different realities

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
with slightly different
ways of feeling, and seeing,

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and reading the story
that's going on.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the conflict aspects.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then this is the
big resolution part

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
where we have to have all
this conflict and things.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So we're in Joseph
Campbell's hero's journey.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.853 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:25:27.853 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
She kind of could relate
to that a little bit.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah,
I think this is--

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that makes a lot of
sense with what we're seeing

00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and feeling going on
around us right now.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we can
take a step back and look

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
at it as a story,
right, we can see it

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
as this is a construct that
we're all feeding, which is not

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:90%
a bad thing.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.805 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:25:49.805 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But if we can see it
from this point of view,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
we can see, oh, we're
in the final act,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:84%
we're about to go get through
this section of the story.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we have all
the sequels to live out

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.463 align:middle line:90%
that we get to go through.

00:26:01.463 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting,
isn't it, how--

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.922 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.922 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
just all the dissonance
that we're seeing

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
play out, even within a
supposed spiritual community.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And I notice a--

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed this in myself,
and I see it in other people

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:90%
around--

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's that gap
between who and what we're

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:84%
opening to becoming, and
where we've come from,

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and what our baseline was.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
our baseline might

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:84%
have been that we
came from a family

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
with certain set of beliefs
and a certain way of operating.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And our awakening, whether
that's through our workshops,

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.245 align:middle line:84%
or some people are doing
it through ayahuasca--

00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about that.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your awakening
is triggered by,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
it shows you the high notes.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's, how do we close
the gap between those two.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:10%
And I think, for me,
like, a certain level

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:10%
of honesty with myself and with
others about the struggle that

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:10%
can sometimes happen in
there, even if it is a story,

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:10%
and you're hooked into
the story emotionally

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:10%
or belief-wise,
just how difficult

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:10%
that can be sometimes.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And I see a lot of people--

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot more people
at the moment throwing knives

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.493 align:middle line:84%
at each other rather
than going, oh, I'm

00:27:15.493 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
struggling with
this a little bit.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised at that
with some people,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
based on my belief about
their supposed consciousness

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:90%
or spirituality.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not surprised when
I track the messages that

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:84%
have kind of been coming through
me for several years, where

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
they've gone, oh, the world's
going to get very emotional.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I used to
hear that as a good thing--

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
oh, great.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.435 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you know, it's going to
be like-- not necessarily.

00:27:40.435 --> 00:27:41.935 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a different
kind of emotion.

00:27:41.935 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, different
kind of intensity rising.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm noticing that play
out in spiritual communities.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
People-- and I mean, this
has been going on for years.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not new.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be an
acceleration of break-ups,

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and whether that's
business partner, friend.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of surprising.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you think,
oh, wow, I thought,

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.773 align:middle line:84%
with a certain level
of consciousness,

00:28:02.773 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
or understanding, or equipment
that this wouldn't happen.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to remember
that it is all perfect.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
A dissonance revealed itself.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Your mind was not
seeing the dissonance.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The dissonance came
through the energy bodies.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And the energy bodies
went, oh, we're either done

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.122 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to have a break.

00:28:20.122 --> 00:28:20.922 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:28:20.922 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Time will tell.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is kind of-- it's
almost this age of transparency

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:90%
that we're moving into.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it feels very
much like power shifts,

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
the personal power shift that
leads to the collective power

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
shift that shows up in
relationships-- power dynamics,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:90%
power battles, power resolution.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of that going
on that's interesting to me.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
That's certainly the thing that
I'm noticing in the last year

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
or so that's
surprising me the most.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And that could just
be me personally.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you brought up
sort of the collective,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and the individual,
and the shift.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a deep
part of my inner work,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.593 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure out--

00:29:01.593 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
probably those who
are watching the show

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.100 align:middle line:84%
can see that, through the
questionings and things,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been sort of talking
about egos and the collective,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and which comes first.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Can the individual
choose to shift

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:22.152 align:middle line:84%
into the collective reality
that he or she wants to be in?

00:29:22.152 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And then part of me is
like, no, that's already

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:90%
predetermined in your part--

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's this paradox.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to pinpoint
which one is the right way.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
there is no pinpoint.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there's some
sort of merging of the two.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, for me, personally,
it's hard for one individual

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.690 align:middle line:10%
to be so powerful that they
can override the collective.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
That's just my take
on it from what I see.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:90%
But equally, I feel--

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the messages I try
and give to the sensitives

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is the impasse that I work with
a lot, because it's something

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
that took me a long
time to work out,

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's very liberating
when you ingrain it,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is that your bad day
is never personal.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Your bad moment, the thing
that you're struggling with,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
the heavy belief you
have about yourself,

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.493 align:middle line:90%
you got it from somewhere.

00:30:15.493 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It either came through your
ancestry and your family

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
pattern, it came through that
thing someone said to you when

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you were 8, and your
self-esteem was low that day,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was the first
time you'd been

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
wounded in the area
of self-esteem,

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:90%
so you ran with it.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And now it replays
itself from time to time

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that the human dis-ease
that we can feel personally

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:90%
has always come from out here.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have a really strong
story, and you're like, well,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've never been
good at this since birth,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, well then something
didn't support you,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
or somebody enforced
"you're bad at this."

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And you've owned it as your own.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And then on your quiet
days, or your dark days,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
or your heavy days,
you're living with it,

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:84%
blaming yourself, going
round yourself about it.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And it took me many years
of doing that to kind of go,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
hang on a second,
this isn't just mine.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:90%
This came from somewhere.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I stay locked
in, I'm going to suffer,

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and it could get worse.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm able to express
it to someone else,

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
or have someone else help me
with it, or move it somehow--

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and I still see a lot
of sensitives, empaths,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.690 align:middle line:84%
spiritual people, they're very
willing to open to the higher

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
stuff, and give power to other
energies, other entities,

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:90%
other teachers, and thinkers.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But if they're struggling
with something by themselves,

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:90%
it's all them.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
It's all their fault, you know?

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.887 align:middle line:84%
And actually if we
can just break that--

00:31:39.887 --> 00:31:41.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's all them,
meaning themselves?

00:31:41.678 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --cycle.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, meaning, this
is all my fault.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a terrible day,
I'm really down on myself.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one thing doing
this work has really shown me.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has that.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
low point And maybe

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a low point that
they move through.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And it changes, and it morphs.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a low point
they've known for years,

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and they've managed to
just slightly increase it.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But everybody takes a
deep, personal, shameful

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:84%
responsibility around
their low points.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
generous about thanking

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the universe or their
friend for their high point.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:10%
So there's this kind of lock in
what happens around the shadow.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.335 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
it's so important

00:32:28.335 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:10%
that we talk to each other.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.918 align:middle line:84%
Recently we've just
seen this spate

00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
of suicides in the public eye.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Which whenever anything
happens in the public eye,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
it's great, because it just
throw some focus on to people

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
you may not know because
they're out there in the world.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But so much of the suffering
in silence that happens

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
comes because we're
still at a point where--

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's better
than it's ever been,

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.933 align:middle line:84%
but we're still at
a point where there

00:32:51.933 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of shame in
talking about the stuff

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're struggling
with versus talking about

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
your successes, your
achievements, the things

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that society has said,
oh yeah, great, I

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
want to hear about the
great exam result you got.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.473 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I want to
hear that you're in grief.

00:33:08.473 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't quite know what to do
with that, feel uncomfortable,

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you I
feel uncomfortable.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So we learn to silence.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think the best
communities, they really

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:90%
support that energy.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting
because I know,

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
through all this channeling
and other shamanic work

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
doing, we're always

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:90%
told to take responsibility.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's
a fine line that's

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:84%
getting confused that we're
taking responsibility,

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.015 align:middle line:90%
meaning it's all mine.

00:33:39.015 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
All the dirt and all
the crap, it's all mine,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.765 align:middle line:90%
like you were saying.

00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And we keep that in because
that's maybe the messages we're

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:90%
getting is you have to own it.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And many says you have to
own it in order to shift it,

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:90%
which I believe is true.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we're-- like you
said, there's this fine line

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of owning it, and just keeping
it all in, and then you can

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:84%
still own it, it's still yours,
but you can still say it came

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:90%
from these other places.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And then that way it
lightens up the burden.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and I guess a lot of
this is the tone that we use

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:90%
So for example, you could say--

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.290 align:middle line:84%
so if the sentence is you've got
to own it so you can shift it,

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.489 align:middle line:84%
I could sit here and
say, you've got to own it

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.252 align:middle line:90%
so you can shift it, Ruben.

00:34:27.252 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Or I could sit here
and I could go,

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:84%
(SHARPLY) you've got to own
it so you can shift it, Ruben.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole lot of other
levels in between those tones.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:84%
But they're very different,
those two that I just did.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And the way that we--

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.622 align:middle line:90%
sorry, I don't mean--

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:43.830 align:middle line:90%
just checking that I didn't--

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.260 align:middle line:90%
[MAKES GUTTURAL SOUND]

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --at you.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> But I felt it.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> No, and I saw you shift,
which is why I was just

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:90%
checking.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:84%
Because we're sensitive
to that stuff.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> My process was, oh, this
is the example, this is great.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.170 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I was--

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I learned the hard way
when I demonstrated something

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.037 align:middle line:90%
like that to a group in 2013.

00:35:02.037 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I shocked the hell
out of the front row.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And I felt bad after doing it.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And I checked with them.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.863 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
no, no, it's fine.

00:35:07.863 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It just reminded me of my dad.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, it's
a healing workshop.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But still, I don't want to
put more of that out there.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:90%
But it shows you the difference.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I think this is the
problem with spiritual rules

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual statements.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
They can be applied
personally on any given day.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.067 align:middle line:84%
So one day we need to go, oh,
I need to take responsibility.

00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Because perhaps you've
been a bit negligent.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And to come back to
balance, you need

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:32.970 align:middle line:90%
to take some responsibility.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But on another day, if
you're someone who--

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or if you're just someone who
takes a lot of responsibility,

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.360 align:middle line:84%
you probably need to
learn to lighten up a bit.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:90%
So spiritual rules are tricky.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it is not
one rule fits all,

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and it is not one rule
fits all on a certain day.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:10%
And so my acid
test for people is,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:10%
does the spiritual rule make
you feel more open, more loving

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:10%
toward yourself, or does it
make you judge or hate yourself

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:10%
more?

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
people who are

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:84%
in a cycle of judging
and hating themselves

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.565 align:middle line:90%
grab the latest spiritual rule.

00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
You see it a lot with illness.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God, I got cancer.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean I did?

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And my thing is, if you've just
found out you've got cancer,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
this is not necessarily the
time to go digging emotionally.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.850 align:middle line:84%
That's just going
to torment you.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you go, OK, what do
I need for my healing?

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:90%
What do I need right now?

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:90%
This is happening in real time.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Rather than digging
into what I didn't do,

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can look at
that later if I still

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:90%
feel resonant around it.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of that stuff that

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
happens in the spiritual
community that can be alarming.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Because I think it's just--

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
it's if those rules don't
help people self-care--

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and I've been there too.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of done
that "hard on myself"

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:90%
thing with spirituality.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were just
talking before the interview,

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
before we started,
about supplements,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and even ayahuasca, and
some of these entheogens,

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and how it's very personalized.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not for everybody.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And how we have
to sort of cater.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:84%
That we can't say,
oh, everybody should

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
be taking this supplement,
or everybody should

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:90%
go have an ayahuasca journey.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very unique.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're sort of saying the
same thing with spirituality,

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
with all these teachings.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
There is no one fix,
one channel that's

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:84%
going to solve all the
problems, one being

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic
wherever, and that they're

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.753 align:middle line:90%
going to fix everything.

00:37:29.753 --> 00:37:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It just seems
that's not the case.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.083 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about supplements,

00:37:33.083 --> 00:37:34.747 align:middle line:84%
and you were you were
talking about how

00:37:34.747 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
some people in the
spiritual community

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
just don't believe
in supplements.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And I was saying that
what the Zs would say

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.220 align:middle line:10%
is whether the supplement
itself is doing you any good

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:10%
or not, what is
doing you some good

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.020 align:middle line:10%
is the vibration of you wanting
to take supplements to support

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:10%
your health, because that's
a direct energy of supporting

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:10%
your health.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
physical plane, 3D,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.898 align:middle line:84%
and what the physical
is doing to us,

00:37:57.898 --> 00:37:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and then there's the energetic.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody who has that
act of caretaking of themselves

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:90%
is nurturing themselves.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.765 align:middle line:90%
And that in itself is an energy.

00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And I need to
nurture the nurturing.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Because sometimes I get hung up.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll be like, why am I
taking these supplements?

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I know I don't need
all these supplements.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:90%
But I still take these.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.330 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm beating
myself up, judging myself,

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.705 align:middle line:10%
I'm taking all
these supplements,

00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:24.360 align:middle line:10%
knowing that I have the power
to not take the supplements.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But like you said,
nurturing the idea

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that this process, this ritual
of taking the supplements,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:90%
is itself nurturing myself.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Therefore I need
to nurture this.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Therefore I don't
need to beat myself up

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.280 align:middle line:90%
for taking supplements.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's actually
just-- yeah,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because also the truth is--
and they talked about this with

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.080 align:middle line:90%
addiction--

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that if we can release
the judgment cycle that

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:84%
holds our patterns in place,
then our patterns often

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:90%
change organically anyway.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So for example, yes, you'll
have a happier life if you go,

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.087 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm a bit of a
monk and a warrior,

00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and that's part of my archetype.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And monks and warriors are
quite diligent about the way

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.730 align:middle line:90%
they look after themselves.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And we know that's
part of your archetype.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you can just let
yourself be OK with doing it,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
it's either going to carry on
or it's going to slightly shift.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's often that the judgment
cycle holds us in a pattern

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that can be destructive
towards us, which in your case,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.138 align:middle line:90%
it isn't.

00:39:25.138 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting, isn't it?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to keep
myself in check, though.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:10%
Because sometimes I think
I do fall into patterns

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:10%
and ways of things that--

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.853 align:middle line:10%
>> I think we all do.

00:39:33.853 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
difficult things about being

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Because especially
when you learn

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality and
energy, you start to go, God,

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.034 align:middle line:90%
I'm really flawed.

00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:45.002 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got a really
long way to go.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that part of it
is that that stuff can enhance

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:84%
our humanity, and that we're
supposed to bring as much

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of that in as we can, but it's
not like a hardline "you must."

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And if ever it is
coming in in that way,

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
then that's an interesting
thing to look at.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Why are you so
aligned with this--

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:90%
[WHIP NOISE]

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:10%
Because I do really
think that being human

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:10%
is a difficult thing.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.960 align:middle line:10%
And I come from a
privileged place.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:10%
I've never been on the streets.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.713 align:middle line:10%
I've never been physically
or violently-- you know,

00:40:20.713 --> 00:40:23.130 align:middle line:10%
there's certain things that
other people have gone through

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:10%
that I know I haven't.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:10%
But I still recognize,
as most people do,

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.930 align:middle line:10%
there is a wonder about being
on this planet and being human,

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:10%
and there is a struggle
and the suffering side.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And you only have to look at the
world and the map of the world

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:90%
to see the truth of both.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's important
to acknowledge too.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we were
all acknowledging this

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:90%
with each other more.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:10%
And I see this in
12-step communities.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm close to a few
people in 12-step.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So I spent some time
in the 12-step rooms.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they
were fantastic if,

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
for nothing else, because
you go around the room,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and for five minutes, you
hear a bunch of people talk

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.183 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on.

00:41:02.183 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And obviously there's a lot
of humor in those rooms.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:10%
It's not the kind of
tragic, crying fests

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.130 align:middle line:10%
that movies make it out to be.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:10%
But what you hear is
people's underneath.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.895 align:middle line:10%
And you're in a
room for an hour,

00:41:15.895 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and you hear
people's underneath.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.895 align:middle line:10%
And I was in there going, oh my
God, this is like my workshops.

00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:10%
But it's timed.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.830 align:middle line:10%
It's an hour long.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's really powerful
and very galvanizing,

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I think, to hear the
struggles of the human spirit.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And that somehow connects you
to yourself and other people

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of
struggle present.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has a very uplifting
effect versus, I think,

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that whole silence around that
stuff, where so many people are

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.938 align:middle line:84%
walking around the world
with fears or hesitations

00:41:48.938 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that they're not sharing
with other people.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:10%
And that was what blew my mind
when I started doing this work.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel a bit more
normal, because I was like,

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:84%
wow, this person is sharing
this intimate thing with me.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
see, after working

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.430 align:middle line:84%
with thousands and thousands of
people, you're like, oh, wow,

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:90%
this is just a map.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
This is going on for
everybody at some level.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's really
helpful when you know

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:10%
that because it helps you take
the pressure off yourself.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was one
of my greatest--

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the greatest
aspect of the ayahuasca

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
journeys and the
ceremonies that I sat in,

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.720 align:middle line:90%
is that they would become very--

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:84%
after this experience, this deep
transformational experience,

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:84%
for me, the biggest
part of the experience

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.630 align:middle line:90%
was the sharing part.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Sitting in the
circle, everyone's

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:84%
sharing their experience
from the night before, which

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
then leads down to years
of trauma in the past,

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.860 align:middle line:84%
or these other things,
and these resolves.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Usually there's some sort of
resolve in these ceremonies.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.268 align:middle line:10%
But that sharing aspect drew me.

00:42:52.268 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I
picked up the camera

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:10%
and I started shooting
these ceremonies,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:10%
and doing this
documentary I'm doing now

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:03.790 align:middle line:10%
with the shamanic teachings
and how that all works.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very much like a 12-step--

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.042 align:middle line:90%
you know, sitting around.

00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then-- we were
just talking earlier--

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:90%
it comes down to story.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's just
sharing their story.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.165 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's listening,
and integrating.

00:43:15.165 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We're integrating
each other's stories,

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're feeling the
empathy for each other,

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and trying to support.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, how
can I help you out?

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.412 align:middle line:84%
Let's go have a
meal, and let's go--

00:43:28.412 --> 00:43:29.870 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
I can do for you?

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And building community
and all that.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It really creates connection
when people have that.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think there's a
perception that often, oh, I

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:10%
can't tell them
that because they'll

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:10%
ostracize me or reject me.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And yet the opposite is true.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.410 align:middle line:10%
We just came back two days
ago from North Carolina.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.620 align:middle line:10%
And we were running
a five-day retreat.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I do
about eight a year,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:10%
eight events or retreats a year.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:10%
And what is present
in the room, I

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:10%
think, on the second-to-last
day in that retreat,

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:10%
very organically, because
we had created a space where

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:10%
everything was allowed,
we had three people

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:10%
talk about some pretty
harrowing child sexual abuse

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.680 align:middle line:10%
experiences they'd had.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And we had a couple of other
people talk about attacks.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But it came up within this
container that we'd created,

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.950 align:middle line:84%
where there was a lot of
love, there was laughter.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And then in this came.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
the safety of, we're

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:31.600 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about the
underside as well as the aim,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:84%
where you'd like to go and
where you've come from.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And people just were
in love with each other

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.165 align:middle line:84%
on the last day,
and like a family,

00:44:38.165 --> 00:44:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and because that was
allowed to be present too.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:10%
And I've noticed that
if it isn't allowed

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:10%
to be present then
there's always something

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.660 align:middle line:10%
missing in a connection.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:84%
If the shadow can't
be loved, honored,

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and accepted by another
person in the room, then

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.480 align:middle line:84%
there's never a
full intimacy, which

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is so missing in our
training as human beings.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's so kind of whitewashed
in our schooling

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and in our education systems.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like, at the
moment, that's changing.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Certainly different
to 20 years ago.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see what it's
like 20 years from now.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's definitely
a movement right

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.730 align:middle line:84%
now to discuss and own the
shadow in a whole new way.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, hats
off to your work,

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and for embracing the shadow.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Like our conversation here,
I think it's much needed.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:40.610 align:middle line:84%
We definitely-- I'm seeing
it in my circles, and life,

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:43.148 align:middle line:90%
and research, and my journeys.

00:45:43.148 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh yeah,
this is definitely

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:84%
a big aspect of what's needed
in the spiritual communities

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and the work.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And so for you offering this
and doing this, it's huge.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:90%
