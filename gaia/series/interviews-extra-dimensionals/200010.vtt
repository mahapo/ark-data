00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Vashta.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We're at an undisclosed
location in the middle

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're in America.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%
So we can do this.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:90%
We can have this interview.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We can have this conversation.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about
this off and on for--

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- a year?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> A year at least.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad it worked out.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> You're an artist.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:90%
You're an empath?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Intuitive?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.482 align:middle line:84%
>> I would call myself
an intuitive artist.

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>> An intuitive artist?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's say.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain a little
bit about that.

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Explain what do you do in that--

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I use a 3D
program to depict--

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I started off with depicting
stuff that I've seen,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:84%
beings that I've seen
in my dream adventures,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
or meditations, or
visions, because I noticed

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't really any
depictions of them that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%
were realistic.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And I started doing that
for myself and posting it.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And people started
liking it a lot,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:10%
and then they started
asking me to do it for them.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically a
process where, at the start,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.580 align:middle line:10%
I was just taking descriptions
because I wasn't really

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:10%
sure if I could connect or not.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But as the time went by, I
started getting confirmations

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
about some things that I would
do, I would be inspired to do,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:90%
but nobody has told me to.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And people were
recognizing ETs that they

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
have seen in their dreams.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
They have been recognizing stuff
from the books they've read.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with quite
a few channelers, depicting

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
the beings that
they're channeling.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I started
connecting to them properly.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was more about
trusting myself.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I think I was connecting
with them the whole time,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but I really didn't
trust myself.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And when that shift
happened for me,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
it opened up a whole new
field for playing with this.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're helping
me depict them.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
They're telling me what
to do, what not to do.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they show
themselves to me.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And I can clearly see them
and depict what I saw.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I see nothing,
and they are just guiding me

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:90%
within my program that I use.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I see the end result
when it's finished.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of blind working
there, which really requires

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of self-trust for me,
and trusting the connection,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So every single
piece is different.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When did this
all start for you?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
This sort of-- well,
I guess backing up

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.142 align:middle line:84%
to when you first started to do
your own work from the visions

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and meditations that you saw.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say it's been
about a year and a half.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not counting the moments
where I was just drawing them

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
off of descriptions because I
was really just playing around.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't plan on making
a career out of it.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't plan any of this.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I just needed some
pictures for my web site.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was nobody
that could do them,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
so I was like OK,
let's try and play.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
previous experience

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
with photo manipulation,
and Photoshop, and artwork.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe 3D would be
a good way to play with this.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I think it was
about a year and a half.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it happened
really, really fast.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I just started posting my works,
and within a month or two,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:84%
people started asking
me for commissions.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm still not really
believing what happened.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, I'm an artist.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:10%
I do this sort of work.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But the way I got
into it was simply

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:90%
by following my excitement.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh, how am I
going to earn money from this?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It just went its own way.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So with all the contacts
working in connecting to these

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
beings, when, in your life,
did this start happening?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you know from birth
that there's something

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
greater outside?

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.208 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something else going
on with these other beings?

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm remembering a
lot from my childhood.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember even stuff before
I even learned how to walk.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And I had a lot of encounters.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the faces, but
I remember the feeling of it.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember being
pulled out of my body.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember, after a while,
when I started, I guess,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
getting into socializing with
other children and all of that,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I started fearing
it a little bit.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized it
was not something that

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to be happening.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that others were
having the same experiences.

00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:37.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But before that, it just
felt like home to me.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, for
the longest time,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
all of that was

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because I was too little to
understand what is an ET.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They were just
like family to me.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It was normal.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe back
in 2011 or '12,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I had this big awakening
moment where I just woke up,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and everything just seemed
funny and ridiculous,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and this whole life.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there a
catalyst for that?

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Was there a specific something--

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was kind of
like a catalyst, I guess.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I was getting
these dreams--

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
now I know they were
from Arcturians,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:90%
my Arcturian family.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I was getting dreams
and downloads,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to this realm
that was like pure light,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and everything was white.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was understanding that
I'm in contact with something,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
which race it was.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anything about it.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one night,
I was lying in my bed,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and I looked through
the window, and there

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was just this one star blinking
right at me through the window.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else was visible.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I took my phone app,
and checked what it is.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And was like, OK, Arcturus.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered that back
when I was 18 or something,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I was lying in the grass
with some of my friends,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and we were just looking at
the stars and talking about,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
what do you think where home is?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we were clubbers, and
we were into this trance music

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and all that, and this
whole story about ETs

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:90%
was totally normal for us.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So we always had
these conversations.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked me,
what do you think home is?

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was pointing at one
of the stars that really

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
was attracting my
attention, and I

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
remembered it was
Arcturus, the same thing.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of connection
with that past experience

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
made me understand that
there's something more to it.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
And I started researching.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
And I was already
waking up, in a way.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
In a way where you understand
that what is happening here

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is not really what
we've been told.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole secrecy
and all that stuff,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the chem trails,
everything, the whole shebang.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And after my awakening, I
kind of gotten over all that.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I call that the
conspiracy phase.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, everyone first goes
through the conspiracy phase

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
before they actually get
to the awakening, I guess,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:90%
if that's the--

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.317 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a good
thing, I think,

00:09:14.317 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
because fear stuff usually
shakes people up to wake up,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and it's a necessary step.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I kind of gotten
over that very fast.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Within a year or
two, I was already

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.220 align:middle line:90%
researching something else.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was more
interested in ETs.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And after that
awakening happened,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
just by realizing that I don't
have to prepare for 10 years

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to connect to ETs and
have these abilities,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I released that block.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started having extensive
communications with them.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sharing
a lot about them

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because it was all
very new to me.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And back then, I didn't have
all the Facebook friends

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:90%
that I have now.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't talking to many
people that were abroad.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And in my country,
in Serbia, there

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
was wasn't many that
were interested in this.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
So I did my own research.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And in what way did you
have these contact experiences

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Usually dreams.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Dream experiences where
I would go into astral--

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I already had some kind
of a spiritual training

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
whole of my life--

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
meditation, and shamanism,
and all kinds of stuff.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So I understood that to that
degree, what was going on,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was going
somewhere, and I

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
was having these
communications and downloads.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And they were teaching me this.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
come back and really

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
struggle to remember and
write it down or something.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what to
do with it at that point.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was researching,
just like you,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to all
these different people.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to all
these different channelers.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
while, I started

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect
directly to these beings.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of listening
to Darryl, I

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
would try and figure out,
well, what would Bashar say?

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
What would this one say?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:90%
What would that one say?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I started getting
feeling and the energies,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
which were very different than
what you're used to when you're

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
talking to humans.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So it was obvious
to me that it was

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the ET, extraterrestrial
energy or something

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.760 align:middle line:84%
higher, on a higher
level, because of the way

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:90%
they were communicating with me.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But as for artwork there
was this specific moment

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
when I realized that
I can channel it.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to
Rob, another channel

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that you interviewed
in your series.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We're very good friends,
so we work a lot together.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I ask his entities
for some confusions

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
that I have about
my own journey.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
pictures that I've

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
done before I started
channeling was just

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:90%
this feline hybrid being.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know
who he was, what it was.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I just felt I was going to
draw him, and that was it.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about that.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Within several months,
I had a session,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:90%
a channeling session with Rob.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And I just asked about--

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
actually, I asked
about my cat back then

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
because I was interested why
am I connecting so well to her,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and why I was feeling
energies that are not just

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:90%
animal energies in her.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And Rob's channeled entity
explained to me that--

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Aridif or TReb?

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Aridif.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Aridif.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
He explained to me that my
cat is an extension of an ET

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:84%
counterpart that I have within
the feline civilization.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And it still didn't
dawn on me at the time.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK,
that makes sense.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And after that session,
I just sat with my cat

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and communicated with her.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
her, give me a name.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're connected to
some other being out there

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or expression of this other
being, give me a name.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And the name I got was the same
name I got for that picture

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that I did of that feline being
that I thought I just made up.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
at him, he even

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
had the same collar pattern as
my cat and the same green eyes.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But the first time
when you drew the picture,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:90%
you didn't make that connection.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I had no idea.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
started happening for me.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Aridif just simply said
that the cat was the extension

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
of the being, and then that's
when things connected for you?

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Because when I heard
it, I didn't connect it.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I
didn't know I was

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:90%
connected to any feline beings.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
There was three or four
months gone by in between

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:90%
that I really forgot it.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done many other
drawings since then.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
name came through,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because the name came
through for this one as well,

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and it was the same name, and
then that's when I realized.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what opened me up
to the idea that I can do this,

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and that pretty much everyone
can do this if they just

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
release the self-doubt.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I was an experiencer,
and I came across your work,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and I had my own experiences--
whether it was a dream,

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
or physical, or however,
my interpretation of that--

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to draw that or
have a physical representation

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.213 align:middle line:84%
so I could show other
people, this is what I saw.

00:14:35.213 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not an artist.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So I call you up, and I say,
hey, I had this experience.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
What is that conversation
like, between--

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, I can't tap
into something like that.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But there has to
be a level of it

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
being open enough for me to
depict it the way I see it.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm not an Illustrator.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I probably could be, but
that's not too exciting for me.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So just working
off of descriptions

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
is not something that
produces very good results

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
when I'm working on it
because I'm not all in it.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But if I get the chance
to connect and figure out

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
what it is, maybe find
out some information

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
or connect to these beings,
they might show themselves to me

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Or they might use a slightly
different appearance

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
because the person who saw
them for the first time

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:84%
didn't see them well, or
maybe it's a screen memory,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe they show themselves
differently every time

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
because their vibration
is so high that they

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
change their appearances.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very malleable.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try to
explain to people first.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're not like a
crime scene, redrawing the--

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But I know quite a
few good ones that

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:90%
have made pictures of Bashar.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> That do that based
on the descriptions,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and they do this description.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm more like a--

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I wrote it on my
website-- like a dancer

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:90%
interpreting the music.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I connect to the frequency, and
that's my most important thing

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
to translate.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
If I can translate
the frequency,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
the details are
not that important.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
relax into this,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
the details are coming out well.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no way for me to check
other than get a confirmation

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
from the person that got the
portrait when they saw it.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And very, very often, they come
back at me with shock and awe.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that I've depicted

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
something they have been
seeing since they were a child?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they don't.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they don't really
manage to connect immediately,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:90%
but they connect in the dreams.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It does some kind
of an activation

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:90%
that I don't fully understand.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not trying to.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just letting it
do its own thing.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I try
to intervene, it

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
makes it that much
longer for me to finish.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:90%
It's creating obstacles.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:90%
It's creating doubt.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm not sure
whether their hair is blue,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%
whether their hair is--

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started doing
that, I do it often still.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a professional
channeler.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Every single portrait is a
process for me, of self-trust,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of all of that, until at
the end, I'm happy with it.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK, this is it.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really about the
person when they see it,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the emotion
that they get when they see

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the picture as opposed to their
analytical mind seeing this

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
or that.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Your focus, your goal
is to recreate the emotion

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in the individual watching
the picture as opposed

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:90%
to the specifics.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> A true artist.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it all
involves colors that I use.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It involves
backgrounds that I use.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It involves symbols sometimes.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, more than before,
lately, a lot of things

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
appear in the image
that I haven't

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:90%
seen while I was doing them.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
shadow over one eye

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that actually was meant to
mean something or some details

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Then later on, I get
messages from them

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:90%
that that's what it means.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm like, oh.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was about
this, but I still did it.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You're following that
guidance and intuition.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So you're channeling.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you're
channeling those energies

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and just putting it in the--

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
there's intuitive writers.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:90%
There's channelers.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
There's you, who's
an intuitive artist.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, from what I understood,
the biggest problem between us

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and the ETs, one of
the biggest problems,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
is our language that doesn't
really translate well

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
what they have to tell us.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm seeing this as a way
to circumvent the language

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and go directly
to the experience.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
be much easier.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
People get touched
by it much easier

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
than the message
that comes with it.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, no
message comes with it.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
That's not part of
my, I guess, offering.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.235 align:middle line:84%
I'm not promising them
that I will get something.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's hard
to say, right?

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to say.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they really
don't want to talk to me.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.748 align:middle line:84%
They want to talk to
their own connection.

00:19:34.748 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And has that happened?

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who's commissioned
you to do an artwork,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just not
getting anything from that?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it has.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you do in that case?

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You just tell the
people, hey, I'm sorry,

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting anything?

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Two or three times, and it's
usually in cases where people

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
already have a
connection working,

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
people who are already aware
of something in the dreams,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:84%
or people who are even
channeling already.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Then the being is
like, he can talk to me

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
or she can talk to me herself.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's to get them
to activate a little bit more,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and to try and establish some
kind of a permanent rapport

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
instead of just
getting information

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
from all these other people
about their own connection.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.038 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes, it's
to draw them out,

00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and they just don't want to say
anything except that they are

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
wanting them to
do it themselves.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Have you done any--

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I forget-- have you done
depictions of Aridif or TReb?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh, actually, I have
seen the TReb one.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.135 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I've
seen the Aridif one.

00:20:42.135 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Aridif is the one that he
uses in everything, almost.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> With the purple eyes?

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:90%
That's yours.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure where
that came from.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I saw a piece
of art you've done from--

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:90%
well, from Bashar.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I recently
saw the Bashar movie,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that it was more like
a cartoony, little cutesy--

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Casper the Friendly Ghost.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that was in the movie.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But then I saw
yours, and I'm like,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.667 align:middle line:84%
I think yours is a little
closer to, probably,

00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:90%
what the real Bashar looks like.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was really, really
excited about seeing the movie.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
saw the depictions,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the way they're done,
it clicked to me

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're pretty much doing
the same thing I'm doing.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:90%
They're channeling the emotion.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
If you had the beings I
depicted, the way I see them,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
walking around
like that, I think

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.412 align:middle line:84%
there would be a lot of
kids scared, you know?

00:21:43.412 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't want to do that.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But I am always
open to being wrong.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It might be that
I'm totally off,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and that's only how I
see them, and nobody else

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:90%
sees them that way.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that we
will find out very soon.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've
recently done this--

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:90%
I forget the name--

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:90%
is it Sherry or Cheryl?

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:90%
This YahYel female.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Shayla.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Shayla, Shayla.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Shayla is somebody that
I have been working with

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
in my dream states
on their ship.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:10%
And that was all the
way back from 2013,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:10%
when I got into the
Hybrid Children.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I first met
my Hybrid daughter,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:90%
which shocked me completely.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't looking for it.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't researching it.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I
started researching more

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
about the abductions,
and the Greys,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and started remembering my
experiences from childhood.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.297 align:middle line:84%
>> So you met your Hybrid
daughter before you even knew,

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
really, about the Hybrid--

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I even had an idea
about what a Hybrid Child is.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I kind of heard it from
Bashar back then a little bit,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
but I really did not
look for the connection.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
also in the dream.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was the most realistic
emotional experience that I've

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:90%
ever had with any other ET.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was that?

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe the experience?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the dream was basically
somewhere in the mountain

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:90%
range, all the way up high.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I had a feeling
it might have been

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet or some kind of a
big mountain range like that.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And we were almost at the tops,
and there were a lot of people

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were all waiting
for them to come.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And silly me, I thought
I was with my friend,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
keeping him company,
and he was going

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
to meet his children
or some connection.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
standing on the side.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
all of them disappeared,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and there was just
this one little ship

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:90%
with the glass dome.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It looked like something
from a cartoon almost,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
like a single person
ship, that materialized

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
on the ground a little
bit away from me.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they
came to see my friend.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:90%
But my friend was already gone.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was all alone
there, at night,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a mountain.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And snow was everywhere.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just having this
feeling, taking a deep breath,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:90%
like, OK, this is it.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
an encounter now.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I was totally lucid.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that
this was going on.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You knew you were dreaming.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a possibility
that I wasn't.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to see
those differences easily.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a possibility
that I actually got

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:90%
snatched and teleported there.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
In any case, I remember
it slowly descending.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And this being came
out of that ship

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a
white space suit.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember she had
white hair and yellow face,

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:90%
like the weird yellow.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't get that kind
of yellow on Earth.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It was like a mustard
color, just brighter.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:90%
From the distance.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was just some ET.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
going to be all cool

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and coming to meet them.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But my legs just
stopped working.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:90%
My knees were shaking.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I totally had a reaction like
you would have right now,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:84%
in real life, if something
that unusual happened to you.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It didn't feel like a dream.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was slowly
approaching anyways.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And I saw big black eyes, but
not big, big Grey, just bigger

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:90%
than ours.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I was coming
to the range where

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I could discern the
facial expression,

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I saw this being smile.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, like
a resonator thing,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it happened that I
understood immediately

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:90%
that she's my daughter.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And this whole physical
discomfort and experience

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:90%
disappeared immediately.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just came to her, and she
did this sign language thing

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.972 align:middle line:84%
that I remember teaching
her in other dreams.

00:26:04.972 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
it was a Hybrid.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was dreaming
about having some kids.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I remember teaching her.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And she did something like this,
twice in the chest, and said,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:90%
"elrah."

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:90%
The voice was like--

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
the closest I can
describe it is if you

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
put a cooling fan in
front of your face

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and start talking in it.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It was chopped.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Like, err.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.795 align:middle line:90%
Choppy, yeah.

00:26:31.795 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah it was very choppy.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit
higher pitched, like it

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:84%
was sped up or not really
fitting my vibration

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:90%
so it sounded differently.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just standing
there and not knowing my name.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Like I was supposed to
say my name or something,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of
stopped identifying

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:90%
with all these names.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was just standing
there and shrugging.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And she telepathically sent
to me, don't worry, Mom,

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I know who you are.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I just started laughing.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And she had this
device that I've never

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
seen anywhere else before that
almost looked like a tricorder.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was doing some scans
around the planet and stuff

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
much all I remember.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I had it cut.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I remember
all these different people

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:84%
in a huge hangar, talking
to their own children.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing that these
ships that the children were in

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
were actually going inside the
mountain, through the wall.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But after that, for
a week, I was crying.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I was so shook up because what
do you do when you find out

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
you have a child
somewhere out there?

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have
a physical child,

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
so this was my first impression
of feeling like a mother.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was
very hard for me.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But why were we even
talking about that?

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think I started
asking about Shayla.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Shayla, yes.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.595 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I got it.

00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:03.928 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said you've been
doing a lot of communicating

00:28:03.928 --> 00:28:05.095 align:middle line:90%
with her on their own ships.

00:28:05.095 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's related.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's related because
Shayla is one of the people

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with along
with Hybrid Children.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:10%
She is one of the
YahYel, and she

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:10%
has been a counterpart
of a friend of mine

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:10%
that I used to work with.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:10%
But since these counterparts
seem to be so flexible,

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different people can
have the same counterpart.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of different people
started connecting with Shayla

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
when I depicted her.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, she was
one of the rare ones

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%
that I've actually seen.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking to
her, and I remember

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:84%
her blue skin and the
gold locks, and all of it.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, she was in
charge of some kind of a Hybrid

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Children human introduction.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.898 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what is
she doing right now,

00:28:54.898 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:84%
but I know that there are
people who are starting

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to channel her out there.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So whoever wants to
look it up, they can.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.192 align:middle line:10%
Back then, we were this team of
researchers and experiencers,

00:29:06.192 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:10%
and we were connecting to
all these different beings.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And then Rob was
very helpful for us

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
because we could talk to
these beings through him.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And eventually--

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Rob channel
Shayla at any point?

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think he channeled
her quite a few times now.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Shaun Swanson also
channeled Shayla.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like Shayla is
one of the prominent figures

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
in their YahYel society, and
she has a lot of communications

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So she is very open to
people connecting to her

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
if they want to find out about
their Hybrid Child, Children

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
or Child, or just their
connections to the YahYel

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:90%
or the Hybrids in general.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>> When you first heard about
the Hybrid Children, YahYel,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:10%
Sassani, did it all
resonate right away?

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Or did you--

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after having that
experience with my daughter,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I really did not have
any doubts about it.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:90%
But then I started researching.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of dots
started connecting

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:84%
because I was going through
all these different kinds

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of material, not just the
channeling, but also abductees.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:90%
People who had traumatic events.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.395 align:middle line:84%
People who had military
abductions, all that sort

00:30:28.395 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:90%
of thing I was researching.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I was being taken

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little child.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something
that started for me when

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I was able to have children.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I also remembered that I had
a few unexplained pregnancies

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that also the disappearance
of them was unexplained.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain that?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:90%
About two months, pregnancy?

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> About two months.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.408 align:middle line:10%
I remember I ended up--

00:30:57.408 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a common thing.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I ended up in a hospital.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.983 align:middle line:10%
And this is probably good to
share because a lot of people

00:31:03.983 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:10%
had these experiences.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I ended up in a hospital
because the doctor determined

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
English expression

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.330 align:middle line:84%
for that-- but it's a pregnancy
outside of uterus that

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:90%
is very dangerous.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The fetus gets attached
to the ovary or something.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the medical stuff.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:90%
People can look it up.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up in a
hospital because they

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
wanted to operate
on me even though I

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
knew there was no chance
for me to be pregnant.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But did it show up
on pregnant test?

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Seven doctors did
ultrasounds, probes, all over,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and they all saw the
baby's heart beating.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they were
prepping me for surgery.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I was already in that
surgical gown and everything.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And the results from the lab
came, and it wasn't anything.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it was
just, like, polycystic ovaries

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of syndrome.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I just remember lying
there, and seven of them

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
were looking at that
monitor that I did not see.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It was next to my head, and
they saw baby's heart beating.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, we
have to end this right now,

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because if it breaks,
it might kill her.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.295 align:middle line:90%
>> That was one time.

00:32:22.295 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:84%
The other time,
it was like that.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It was like a two months
pregnancy out of nowhere.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I did not have a relationship.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
There was no way for
me to be pregnant.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.937 align:middle line:90%
And then it was gone.

00:32:32.937 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> How long was the first?

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Was that about two months
as well before you--

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> They said that it
was almost six months.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Six months, wow.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Or five months or something.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It was quite big.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was shocking
to me because I'm like,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:90%
how would I not know?

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I had pains, but--

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:84%
so yeah, that shifted
my whole perspective

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
when I remembered that and
all these different times

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:84%
when I was getting
taken from my room.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the childhood
memories of hearing the plane.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Humming sound was triggering
me into leaving my body.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was all ready
when I hear a specific sound,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew something
was going to happen.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these encounters
from my childhood

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
had a screen memory of a
cartoon character, though.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So I've developed a little
bit of a traumatic reaction

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
when I would see certain
cartoon characters.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Even "ET the Extra
Terrestrial" movie

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.650 align:middle line:84%
was triggering me into something
that I did not understand.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I've learned, as
I was researching all of this,

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that because I didn't
understand it, I was fearing it.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But once they took
me, and I was already

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:84%
in that conscious space
with them, it was like home.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It was just that moment of
getting me out of my shell,

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I guess, out of my
third density reality.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:10%
That was scary for me.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:10%
And also, another thing
that a lot of experiencers

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:10%
with the abductions and
Hybrid Children have in common

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:10%
is that their family
has a military history.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
It's usually the
father who was part

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of the military or somebody from
the male side of the family.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.422 align:middle line:90%
And that's the case with me.

00:34:15.422 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He wasn't really
directly connected,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:84%
but he was working
with the army,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.075 align:middle line:84%
and he was working on
some top secret projects.

00:34:23.075 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:84%
So it all just
really fits together

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.130 align:middle line:90%
when you research all of it.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because I
started researching

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the abductees and
the experiencers

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.167 align:middle line:84%
before I got into the channeling
and the Hybrid programs

00:34:41.167 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went more
of the conspiracy,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:90%
hard evidence side first.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:84%
And then this stuff
started connecting

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:90%
the dots for that world.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
So I had that perspective first.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can totally
appreciate that.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I was spiritual my
whole life, but I

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
had a moment where
I really did not

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
want anything to do with
anything unless it's

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
scientific.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it was like up to here
from all the fake information

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that you can get.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
find something that's

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:90%
like Bashar, for example.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:10%
At least at that moment,
it was hard for me.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:10%
So I just shunned it all away.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:10%
And the only reason
I got back into it

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.640 align:middle line:10%
were pretty much Nassim Haramein
and Bruce Lipton, Dr. Bruce

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.440 align:middle line:10%
Lipton.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:10%
That's what got me back into
spirituality because there

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:10%
was somebody finally explaining
it in a scientific way

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:10%
instead of that it's
something magical happening.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It's both, I understand that.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.024 align:middle line:90%
But this element is needed.

00:35:49.024 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's not even
rigid structure anymore.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just cold, hard facts.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It's needed.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that
was the entrance

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:84%
into the whole area of ETs,
and channeling, and everything.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I entered with physics.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I find our past a little bit
similar in a lot of ways.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
When I started getting
into your research,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
sort of simultaneously
with my stuff,

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd cross
notes, and you'd

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
ask questions that I wanted
to ask, and then vise versa.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've been a fan of your
exploration, and your research,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:90%
and of course, your art.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like you're
researching at the same time

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and asking these questions.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why it's
fun to do the art,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.880 align:middle line:84%
because I get all
these different beings

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:90%
and information about them.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.013 align:middle line:84%
So how do you discern
the difference?

00:36:44.013 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We had the
conversation yesterday,

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
which was sort of
reassuring, about the Zetas.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What does the Zeta feel like?

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.895 align:middle line:84%
You said something about
coffee or something.

00:36:52.895 --> 00:36:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like
overdosing on caffeine.

00:36:54.895 --> 00:36:55.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:36:55.695 --> 00:36:56.495 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:56.495 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I had my
first Zeta experience recently

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.785 align:middle line:90%
that was very just tight.

00:37:01.785 --> 00:37:04.025 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Overdosing on caffeine--
beautiful way to say that.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:90%
How about these other races?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the Arcturians?

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:90%
What do they feel like?

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem to be feeling the
same for pretty much everyone.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:90%
They feel like home.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Home.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.145 align:middle line:84%
>> They feel like it's very easy
to connect to them because they

00:37:23.145 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:90%
are so ethereal and omnipresent.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They are not usually
in physical bodies.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But what people
don't usually realize

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they are like 17
races of Acturians over there.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.305 align:middle line:84%
And they only know about
one that's connecting

00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:90%
to them or something.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're all different
densities, different kind

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:90%
of advancement.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about them, I tend
to go at least the royal way.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I tend to talk about
the non-physical ones.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:84%
How do they differ
from Acturians.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's, for
example, new for me.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I was never able to connect
with them very well.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But that was mainly
because of the information

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that was coming
online about them

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that I really did
not resonate with.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.988 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have
these preconceptions

00:38:08.988 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
about who they are
and what they are.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about
the human looking Pleiadians,

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:84%
my closest experience is when
I was connecting with Sasha,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.530 align:middle line:84%
who Lisa channels, and
when I was connecting

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to my own counterpart.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And they feel very close to us,
but the experience that kind of

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
got me into their world and
got me to understand more

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
about them was when I
saw through Sasha's eyes.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I had, with Lisa--
this was very funny.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we went back and forth
with me trying to depict Sasha.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And I could not see her.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Every time I would connect,
I would see through her eyes.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I was not able to see her.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So we managed to put it together
along with all three of us.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Rahm was involved as well about
the descriptions, who saw what.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And just put it together.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But that experience
that I had, I

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
think that was my
first experience

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:90%
of proper fourth density world.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And it felt
almost like a dream,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:22.230 align:middle line:84%
like you would feel completely
careless, joyful, serene,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:90%
centered, and wise.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
I can describe it,

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:90%
but still feels human.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just how you would imagine
the wisest and most enlightened

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
person here, and
maybe then some.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Pleiadians feel like.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But they're very,
very close to us.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand why so
many people connect to them,

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:90%
because it feels really nice.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I've really
had that Pleiadian connection

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:90%
thing yet either.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Mantis beings.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> At least the ones I was
connecting with are quite bossy

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They feel bossy in a way
where they don't really

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.370 align:middle line:90%
beat around the bush.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:90%
They tell you everything.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And my first experience
with a mantis

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
was when I was snatched by a
reptilian on a ship that had

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%
all these different races on.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling of it, they all
felt like a "Firefly" episode.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They were all teasing
each other on the ship.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was very relaxed.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.210 align:middle line:90%
And then the mantis being came.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me to death.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I did not know what
I was looking at.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.825 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't get
scared by reptilians.

00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't even get
scared by any of this.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But just the
alienness of the way

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:52.020 align:middle line:84%
it was moving, like a gigantic
insect, like shaking slowly,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and the way I felt like I
was paralyzed by its energy

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:90%
felt like--

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure a
lot of people would

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.830 align:middle line:90%
experience that as a trauma.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I was just
trying to look at it

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and see what can I see,
and what can I feel?

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
focus that it had,

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt
that anywhere else.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the
other crew members--

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:90%
there were hybrids.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.103 align:middle line:90%
And some of them were reptilian.

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:26.370 align:middle line:84%
They were all seeming like
they were beaming respect

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:90%
towards this mantis being.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That was my only experience,
and my first experience with

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.820 align:middle line:90%
a mantis being.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I did not realize it was a
mantis being until, of course,

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I woke up later on
throughout the day, kind of

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.360 align:middle line:84%
started remembering what
it looked like really.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought it was
some kind of a tall gray.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It did not move like
anything I've seen before.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:84%
The closest I can
come is if you've

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
seen "The Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> That last being that
starts coming out of the ship,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
like with long legs,
and looking all shaky.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.722 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've seen.

00:42:05.722 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had another
encounter with them, you said?

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.845 align:middle line:90%
>> I had another one.

00:42:08.845 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, with the
automatic writing.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> With automatic writing.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
they were telling me

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that they require clarity
for communication,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and that I need to
defragment myself,

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:84%
which I understood what
they meant because I

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
was reading about this already.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of really
fits together well,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:84%
about beta brainwave states,
and all these other brainwave

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
states that we have where
they communicate with us.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
basically saying to me,

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.870 align:middle line:84%
at least, is that I have to work
on integrating these states so

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that I can remember what happens
in both, instead of remembering

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:84%
one but not the other
when I'm in these states.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense to me.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I just got really
surprised that they told me

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:90%
that this is what we require.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Like we require
clarity basically,

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or else you're not going
to be talking to us.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not interested
in me misinterpreting.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel loving
energy from them.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just very alien
and very different

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:90%
when you actually see them.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think most
people don't really.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:90%
They have screen memories.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Or they appear as somebody else.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Or their brain
translates into something

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that they're more familiar
with, because anybody

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:36.270 align:middle line:84%
with human DNA seeing a gigantic
insectoid like looking thing

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is going to be freaked
out just by the unusual.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not even scary.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just so unusual
that it kicks you out

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:90%
of your own center.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.600 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's a really
great experience.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have more
experiences with mantis

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:90%
than I do.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I've only had a couple.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But I like to get
different takes and stuff.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I really like
connecting with them.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.765 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very specific.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
beat around the bush.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't go, dear one, you
know, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like this, this, this.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And finally, well, I
know there's many others,

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.630 align:middle line:90%
but reptilians.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, with them
it really depends.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:90%
There's so many different ones.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't say a blanket
statement for all of them,

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
because there are more
malevolent ones, more

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:90%
interested in their own self.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a characteristic
that goes across all of them

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.750 align:middle line:90%
that you could--

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that the one
thing that goes across all

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of them is that they're
connecting very well with

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:90%
our first three chakras.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> They are very carnal beings,
very grounded, very powerful.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So these three chakras,
aligning those three chakras

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in a communication
with a reptilian

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:84%
helps insanely
well, and prevents

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:84%
all these jarring emotions and
knee jerk reactions that people

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.430 align:middle line:90%
have when they see them.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
is that most of them

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:22.580 align:middle line:84%
like display of strength,
display of pride.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So when they first
encounter somebody,

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.510 align:middle line:90%
they're going to puff up almost.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They're going to make themselves
look more threatening.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's almost like
their way of saying hello.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's my experience.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen and what I've
heard from other people--

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe somebody else has
different experiences.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's
the ultimate truth.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But in any case, where I
was connecting to a reptilian,

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:90%
they require respect.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't care much about
lovey dovey feelings,

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.240 align:middle line:84%
unless they're higher up,
like TReb, for example.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But even TReb gets
excited and everything.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.420 align:middle line:90%
He's not really just loving.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:84%
They are almost
like when you have--

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Vikings maybe, or Maori
tribes, that they wrestle just

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.950 align:middle line:90%
to say hello.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And then if you accept
that kind of a greeting,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:84%
you play along with it,
and you do the same thing,

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:84%
you're like rawr, make yourself
look strong and all that,

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:84%
after that they just start
being completely normal.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk to
them like we're talking.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But the ritualistic
thing is over.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And you go on with the
normal communication.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just that from what
I notice, a lot of people

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:84%
get scared by that first initial
response by a reptilian that

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.360 align:middle line:90%
goes.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.235 align:middle line:84%
And they think they're going
to get attacked or something.

00:46:55.235 --> 00:46:56.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:56.035 --> 00:46:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's just
the way they are.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And all of them are like that.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Have you had much experience
outside of ETs and what

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:14.220 align:middle line:84%
we perceive as ETs, in the
sense of demonic, ghosts.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh-hoo-hoo.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Or other energies.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And how would you categorize
those other energies?

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I had extensive
experiences with those.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was my
preparation to do this work,

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.480 align:middle line:84%
because now I can connect
with all these beings

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.900 align:middle line:90%
without freaking out.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So prior to the ET experiences,
you've had other experiences.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:84%
As I told you, I had
shamanic training.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I was never
initialized or anything.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I was just interested
in all that.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And in a lot of things.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.165 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a
Wiccan at some point.

00:47:49.165 --> 00:47:51.730 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> At one time in my
life, in my early 20s,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.930 align:middle line:84%
these astral attacks
started happening very,

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:90%
very frequently.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I also got
involved with helping

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.150 align:middle line:84%
some people that
were basically being

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:13.990 align:middle line:90%
targeted by a satanist cult.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The cult was
targeting these people?

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a story I've actually
never told anyone or anywhere,

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:84%
because I kind of don't
want to scare people.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's my experience in a
way that I've learned something

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.443 align:middle line:90%
very valuable from this.

00:48:31.443 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into the
whole story of what happened.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some time I will
share it in the future.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.380 align:middle line:90%
But I had astral attacks.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I had these beings
trying to suck up--

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:45.530 align:middle line:84%
they almost seemed like
dementors from "Harry Potter."

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to suck out
my soul through my mouth.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of stuff was
happening to me at night.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I would go to what I
call lower astral, which

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is like our subconscious and
conscious, like unconscious

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.070 align:middle line:90%
fears.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a whole
realm just built on that.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Just on fears.

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all like black
and white, very dense,

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and very fearful.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:90%
You feel fearful in it.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had so many of these
experiences that I just--

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.270 align:middle line:90%
it flipped over for me.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:90%
I got sick of it.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And so let's see
what this is about.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try to avoid
it any longer or run away.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know I can
run away already.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Like let's see what
happens when I face it.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of started seeing
what all of these teachings

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.400 align:middle line:90%
are teaching us now.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I saw that in an example
of what was going on

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in those experiences that I am
simply seeing a part of myself,

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that I have not really
recognized and integrated.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I changed my
perspective into that,

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and also changed my
perspective by putting myself

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:84%
in their shoes, what would
it be like to be this being?

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> To be a satanic cult guy?

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.262 align:middle line:90%
Or a demon?

00:50:05.262 --> 00:50:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the actual demon?

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a negative entity that's
wanting something off of me.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What would be my goals?

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:90%
How would I feel?

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I was really wondering why are
they doing what they're doing?

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And by kind of doing
that, overlapping,

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and putting myself in the shoes
of the whatever was making me

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:84%
have these experiences, I
stopped having the experiences.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly every time I
would end up in that realm,

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I would feel empowered.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I would feel like I'm one
of them, wherever I am.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of you guys now.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Or I end up with Acturians.

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of you guys now.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's kind of
how I work through it.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But I was also a target of
that cult at some point,

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because inadvertently I
did like a tarot reading

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to help somebody.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was like me
opening the door

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and saying hi to
them energetically.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had a week of
suicidal thoughts

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:90%
that I knew they weren't mine.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:90%
But it was so strong.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It was so strong.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And a few people have
already killed themselves

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that were white
mages or whatever

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:84%
they were that were trying
to work against this.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think this is the most
important part of what I want

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.740 align:middle line:90%
to share.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.250 align:middle line:84%
The only way I got out
of it was to realize

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that both of these sides
are playing the same game.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When I saw these people who
call themselves white mages

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:44.440 align:middle line:84%
just provoking constantly and
creating this dynamic that was

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:90%
a perfect contrast--

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was an orchestration.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably needed
for their own experiences.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But I just, at some
point, got sucked out of it.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And all the suicidal
thoughts, everything,

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:00.160 align:middle line:84%
just the whole dynamic
just go like poof.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then,
it's very hard for me

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to get into this
duality, because I

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:10.660 align:middle line:84%
can see that both sides are
making the same mistakes.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.730 align:middle line:84%
When you go through a
personal experience like that

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and have that type of a
change of perspective--

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I would say that suddenly from
being a player in the game,

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I started being the
observer of the whole game.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even part
of the game anymore.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.278 align:middle line:84%
>> I was understanding that they
both think they're right from

00:52:32.278 --> 00:52:33.195 align:middle line:90%
their own perspective.

00:52:33.195 --> 00:52:33.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:52:33.995 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're doing what they
have to do to maintain that

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:90%
dynamic.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you get out
of it, it's like friends.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:43.480 align:middle line:90%
They're all friends.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> They're just fellow beings
that have their own thing that

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.800 align:middle line:90%
they're doing.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is what helped
me deal with any kind

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of encounters later
on that I had,

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.800 align:middle line:84%
which were maybe of malevolent
nature and negative.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It never ended up
being that way.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It might have
started that way,

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.750 align:middle line:84%
like maybe some being had
an intention towards me.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But with this perspective,
they simply cannot--

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.400 align:middle line:90%
they lose their will to do it.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.370 align:middle line:90%
They just kind of--

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they're sort of
looking for that reflection

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.760 align:middle line:84%
back so they can
push against it.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:22.025 --> 00:53:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> But if there's
nothing to push against--

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you're not
even part of the--

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not participating
in the argument anymore.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're not fueling it.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's another aspect at
least that I understood when it

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.240 align:middle line:90%
comes to reptilians.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There is this
pushing when it comes

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:90%
to these more ferocious ones.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They are bred to
dominate their--

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.030 align:middle line:84%
it's in their blood
to be like that.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So I filter that out as
just like the way they are.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, when you
address them as an equal,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and if you respect that they
have their own perspective

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and reasons for it, and
not try to shove love down

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.070 align:middle line:90%
their throat--

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's the
worst thing you can do.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It's like a direct attack.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
are like, oh, yeah.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.030 align:middle line:84%
There's one weakness
that these beings have.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.580 align:middle line:90%
But you're perpetuating.

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.310 align:middle line:10%
Like we are supposed
to be trying to find

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.560 align:middle line:10%
a common language, at
least on some level.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't
understand that they

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:84%
have their own
perspective, of course

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.845 align:middle line:84%
we can't, because we don't
understand our fellow humans

00:54:34.845 --> 00:54:35.645 align:middle line:90%
here even.

00:54:35.645 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's the same thing.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand
that this being has

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:84%
their own way of
looking at things,

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
their own way of connecting
to the source, their own way

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:50.100 align:middle line:84%
of doing everything, and if you
come at them with that energy,

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.490 align:middle line:84%
without wanting them to change,
or feeling pity for them,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.520 align:middle line:84%
or trying to help them,
they can be so helpful.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:90%
They are so wise.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.600 align:middle line:90%
You can learn a lot from them.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:07.480 align:middle line:84%
People tend to
misunderstand and misread.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.150 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:14.590 align:middle line:84%
When in contact with such an
experience, if it's something

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that you feel is
malevolent or demonic,

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.140 align:middle line:90%
you always have a choice.

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not like them
doing something to you.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle line:84%
You can respond
in the same way we

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:26.920 align:middle line:90%
were talking about reptilians.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.520 align:middle line:84%
You can be as threatening
to them as they are to you,

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.630 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you want.

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.233 align:middle line:84%
>> You can send them love
if that's what you want.

00:55:34.233 --> 00:55:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But you can try to
understand them.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they want, it seems.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
really get the idea

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that when I was being under
these attacks, energy attacks,

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that really like their ultimate
goal was to somehow destroy me.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It just seemed like
they were on autopilot.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.280 align:middle line:90%
That's how they're geared.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But when I tried
understanding them,

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.510 align:middle line:90%
that whole energy changed.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most important perspective

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to at least having
my-- you don't

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:14.530 align:middle line:90%
have to completely embody it.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:15.580 align:middle line:90%
But remember it.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:18.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're having an
encounter, remember

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:22.690 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand what this
other being is experiencing.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
switches the polarity

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.570 align:middle line:84%
into something that's a bit
zoomed out, a bit more clear,

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.620 align:middle line:84%
a bit more where you can see
that you're not a victim,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.010 align:middle line:84%
or somebody else is a
victim, but that it's

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.740 align:middle line:90%
like a dynamic happening.

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:40.000 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.160 align:middle line:84%
People can defend
themselves from this.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But if that's what
they're going through,

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.900 align:middle line:84%
it means that there's something
they need to look at within.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's coming for a reason.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And being pushed away, it's
just going to make it worse.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Just like our reptilian story.

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They're there to teach us
something to learn a story.

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise they wouldn't exist.

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They have their own role in
creation, like every being has,

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.550 align:middle line:90%
every consciousness has.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:08.350 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not like creation,
and these guys over there.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's just a theoretical
version that people hold,

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.310 align:middle line:84%
like a perspective that haven't
really embodied that yet.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.848 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's good for a start.

00:57:19.848 --> 00:57:21.910 align:middle line:90%
But you need to experience that.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand
that it really

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is that kind of a
connection, that all of it

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is one, in a way that
you can relate to it.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It's part of yourself.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.340 align:middle line:90%
It's reflecting back to you.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.630 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to know.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And this perspective
you have now, I

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:90%
assume this is more recent?

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Or has this perspective sort
of been there for a while?

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's been there since
that experience since I've been

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.290 align:middle line:84%
under all these attacks and
finally kind of stepped back

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and saw how to get out of it.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the whole
game and everything

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.230 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to polarity.

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.760 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that I'm suddenly

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.680 align:middle line:90%
like an enlightened monster.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I still have my own
experiences where I'm biased.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I still have my own
experiences where

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really in alignment.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I get unconscious.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I do something out of my
own programming or whatever,

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.110 align:middle line:90%
reactionary.

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But the overall picture
that is something

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that I'm embodying
every day more and more.

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And especially in experiences
that might be considered

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:28.960 align:middle line:90%
fearful.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I welcome them, because that's
my chance to see where I'm at.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When I'm talking to
these positive beings it's--

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's lovey dovey and fun.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's lovey dovey.

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:90%
It's what everyone wants.

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
asking me, how do

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I connect to the positive ones?

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's OK.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I know that
the fear is a doorway.

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Like Bashar always said, that
was my experience as well.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I sense
fear, I get excited,

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because I know I'm going
to learn something new.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm going to see
something about myself that I

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.640 align:middle line:90%
had a blind spot about.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.387 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I use it.

00:59:08.387 --> 00:59:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically,
I'm super selfish.

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing all of
this just so I can grow.

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just the people
are benefiting all of this.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:16.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.628 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, but that's
everybody's story too.

00:59:19.628 --> 00:59:20.428 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:59:20.428 --> 00:59:22.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of
following your excitement.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I get so, so, so
happy to see that people are

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.430 align:middle line:84%
actually getting
something out of this.

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not my goal.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not my obsession
to wake anybody up.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I can just put it out
there and make somebody else

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.852 align:middle line:90%
open to--

00:59:41.852 --> 00:59:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Have fun doing your thing.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody else
likes it, then they

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.200 align:middle line:84%
can call you and ask
for an ET drawing.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned you
think something got lost

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:57.160 align:middle line:84%
in translation from
the reptilians.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of this old--

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I call it Yakuza
mentality of this sort

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of pyramid structure,
guy on top,

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
owning, controlling
everything else.

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.885 align:middle line:84%
And we sort of relate
that to the reptilians

01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and that reptilian
way of doing things.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:20.210 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a reptilian
is such a blanket term.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so
many different ones,

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
some of them not even
knowing who the Dracos are,

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
not even having ever met
them or contacted them.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But when people talk
about this, they usually

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
refer to the Draco Empire.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And we like calling it empire
because of Star Wars I guess.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And in your research,
do you think

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones that sort
of pushed the whole Orion war

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
situation?

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I understand, the
Orion was also involved with

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:05.730 align:middle line:90%
some human looking entities.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.860 align:middle line:90%
But it was also reptilians.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's still a lot
of reptilians there.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
They're just not as we would
think reptilians to be.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
They've sort of graduated
from that story.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.430 align:middle line:90%
They graduated.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, when a being
is so under pressure, so split,

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
so divided, so contracted, when
the transformation happens,

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.010 align:middle line:90%
it happens that much more.

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So even the Dracos that are
splitting off of this paradigm

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that they had going on there
with the Draconian Empire,

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and them wanting
to rule the galaxy

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
or whatever their goal
was, basically the Dracos

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
can evolve very quickly
once they split off

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and stop buying
into that paradigm.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a pyramidal
scheme, all of these under

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
are not going to be happy.

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:07.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:07.823 --> 01:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter if
they're reptilian,

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.890 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they are.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of shifting
happening there too.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think it relates
to what is happening

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:19.410 align:middle line:90%
on Earth in some way as well.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:23.910 align:middle line:10%
I believe we, by
shifting our perspectives

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:30.600 align:middle line:10%
from the rigid this or that,
and the rigid us versus them

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.980 align:middle line:10%
into a more holistic
view of the whole picture

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.380 align:middle line:10%
is helping them understand
themselves better, because they

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.970 align:middle line:10%
relate to our reptilian brain.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
They relate to our
passionate instincts,

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
to I don't even know
what would I call it

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.750 align:middle line:90%
except for the reptilian brain.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows what it is.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The lower three
chakras, let's say.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
They can go either way.

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They can either be
balanced, or they

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
can be completely ego based,
selfish, and all that.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
We have all of that within us.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand
them very well,

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
if we would accept that
this is a part of us,

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and resolve that shadow
on a collective base.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening from
what I'm observing now

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.200 align:middle line:84%
is that we are kind of
parallel evolving with them,

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
because they are so engraved
in our business here.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a connection
that has been made.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are
really splitting off.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean that all of then

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to be light,
shiny, and happy.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
just splitting off

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and going there to do their own
thing without following orders

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
anymore, without
wanting to conquer.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They just want to have
their own lives basically,

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.170 align:middle line:90%
their own decisions.

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:52.010 align:middle line:10%
But the latest I have
heard, I think it was--

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:56.160 align:middle line:10%
>> And this story, where
are you getting this from?

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Various different
sources and my own.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
There is a channeler
who channels

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
one of these groups
that have split.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have connections
in a few of these groups

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%
that have already split.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%


01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Rob has his own sources that are
talking about the same thing.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Even Roxy, I remember,
she channeled

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the reptilians that
was talking about this.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>> They are getting tired
of playing the bad guy

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:24.930 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxy.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And this role was needed.

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It was needed for us
to learn anything.

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't learn anything without
having a contrast of some sort.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:39.143 align:middle line:84%
>> So we need to appreciate
them for that, for starters.

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
agree with them.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
live like them.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But at least appreciate that
there is a contrast that is

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:47.380 align:middle line:90%
pushing you to learn.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And since now it's
slowly dissolving,

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and the whole humanity is kind
of shifting in this positive

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
direction of integration
and accepting all these lost

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
children that we have
rejected from our own selves,

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the reptilians are
going through the same thing.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Probably not the
most engraved ones

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
on the top, but a
lot of them are.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think
that is great news,

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
because from what we've learned,
all these races have had

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
so many problems
with reptilians.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not just us.

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So who knows?

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going to help
make peace in the galaxy

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.800 align:middle line:90%
without even knowing it.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:30.635 align:middle line:90%
>> At least with them.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:31.435 --> 01:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Your work and your research, you
really sort of opened my eyes

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.540 align:middle line:90%
to these other reptilian races.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I like how you put out
your personal channelings,

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
or channeling sessions you've
had with other channelers who

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
have these reptilians.

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of put that
out there for the world

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and for myself to
listen, compare research,

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and to hear these stories.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it really helps
take away the fear

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and that perception
of, oh, all reptilians

01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
are bad kind of perception
that a lot of us,

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
spiritual communities

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
label and put on these guys.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what I find
funny is like saying all humans

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.690 align:middle line:90%
are like this or like that.

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Or like all members of
this human race are like this

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
or like that.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
The space is vast.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There are millions of these
different beings out there.

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a limited
amount of them

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that are in direct
contact with us.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But we all have these
oversold connections all over

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.220 align:middle line:90%
the place.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
There are places that have
reptilians that did not

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
originate from the Dracos.

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the Dracos
that brought all reptilians

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to our galaxy.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Like TReb, for example, is
like a hybrid between an animal

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.770 align:middle line:90%
reptile and an advanced human.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the
same with Pleiadians.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no all positive
and all negative.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You have all these
different groups.

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Pleiades is a system of
so many stars and so many races

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
around there, just like
Orion, just like Sirius, just

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.100 align:middle line:90%
like Arcturus.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Even though I would probably say
for Arcturus that I don't think

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that a negative
oriented being would

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
be able to exist within that.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They are so high up that they
probably wouldn't be interested

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:32.710 align:middle line:90%
in being there.

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So what races would you say
would be the key ones that

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
have either our
DNA, or spiritually

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.270 align:middle line:90%
that we're interacting with.

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, reptilians for sure.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have their DNA.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.620 align:middle line:90%
We know about that.

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.740 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
The Lyrans.

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Lyrans.

01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:58.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Or Lerans, how
people call them.

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> We didn't cover them yet.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> They are supposedly the
origin of a human form in this

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.470 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's like our
far, far, far ancestry.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And even in the last
interview I did with Lisa,

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.437 align:middle line:84%
she said that
Pleiadians actually--

01:08:17.437 --> 01:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Come from Lyrans.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That was our connection.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.710 align:middle line:90%
They were the Lyrans.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So basically all
these humanoid forms

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:27.689 align:middle line:84%
are related to us, just
like we are to them.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I am not sure about
the insectoid,

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
whether we have their DNA.

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the mantis
beings, even though there's

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.310 align:middle line:84%
so many different ones, again,
most of how I perceive them

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and what I heard about
them was that they're

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.660 align:middle line:90%
master geneticists.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So even if they're not
contributing their own DNA,

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I think they're somehow
involved in this alteration

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.950 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through.

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:55.649 align:middle line:90%
Arcturians for sure.

01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe in the DNA level?

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.109 align:middle line:90%
More of a spiritual level?

01:08:58.109 --> 01:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they're working
on these etheric DNA strands.

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
say we have 12?

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, those 12 are etheric.

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:07.439 align:middle line:90%
They're not physical.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be
manifested as physical,

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.100 align:middle line:90%
at least from what I know.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.689 align:middle line:84%
But they're on
these other levels,

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:17.189 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
8th, 9th, 10th chakra,

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:19.500 align:middle line:90%
different levels of existence.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones that
are seemingly tweaking us.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.439 align:middle line:84%
At least my experience
with them was

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
when they got me
on the ships, they

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:31.649 align:middle line:84%
would somehow tweak my energy
bodies so that in physical I

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
can be more loving,
receive more light,

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and hold in more of that energy.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of like their
thing what they're doing.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.439 align:middle line:84%
And they're also doing a
lot of emotional healing.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> But I can't forget Sirius.

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Sirius.

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Sirius is there, and
all these aquatic beings.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.029 align:middle line:90%
There's felines there.

01:09:54.029 --> 01:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
There's, again, all
these different races

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:57.720 align:middle line:90%
that are around Sirius.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But we are mostly
connecting directly here

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
on the planet with
cetaceans, like whales,

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and all these
beings that are kind

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
of conduits for that energy.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to DNA,
I think at this point

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.640 align:middle line:90%
we can't even tell anymore.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe at some point when it
just started there was a clear

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
picture of who contributed.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
actually happened

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
was, over time, we were
tweaked and tweaked

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.370 align:middle line:90%
by all these different beings.

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And it might be so that
we can be helped more.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It might be for
their own agendas.

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the universe
has a structure that

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.090 align:middle line:90%
is going to end up happening.

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is inevitable.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is no reason for
people to worry when it comes

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
to that.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Somehow it's going to come up.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The cork is going to pop to
the surface, as Abraham says.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But in my opinion, the
most important ones

01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
are the hybrids, because
they're bridging.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:02.500 align:middle line:90%
They're literally bridging.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Physically and--

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> How I saw it, I mean, I
am excited about meeting all

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:10.210 align:middle line:90%
of these physically.

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.910 align:middle line:90%


01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to hybrids,
I understand this thing.

01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is when a human that
hasn't got any idea about ETs,

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that might be afraid, comes face
to face with their own child,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that connection
cannot be ignored.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be broken.

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
very, very tangible.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I felt
it, very strongly,

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
without wanting, expecting
it, or looking for it.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think the hybrids are the
key when it comes to us opening

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
up to these foreign energies.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
That's probably going to be why
we are going to be integrating

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
them in our society,
because they are part us,

01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and they can relate to us
better than the actual ET can.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably a lot of them
would like to ask us a lot

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of questions.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that the
teachers are connecting to us.

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just these beings
who want to share information

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
with us.

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
There are also a
lot of them who are

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
genuinely excited about having
a counterpart as a human.

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the kids seem to be
really excited about coming

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
interesting how they really--

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.510 align:middle line:84%
what is that whole
integration of the kids here?

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That's something that I've
been thinking about a lot.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
But to me, we are
not yet humans.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We are becoming what
we're going to become.

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
see us or themselves

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
as not worthy, or
constantly in conflict,

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.890 align:middle line:90%
or race infesting this planet.

01:12:58.890 --> 01:12:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's really not
the way they see us.

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some of them do, probably.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But most of them are very aware
that we have this genetics

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.330 align:middle line:90%
that's blending within us.

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we are successful in
integrating all these things,

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and all these
emotional extremes,

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:23.190 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be, let's
say, a major player.

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> A major player.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We have a potential to be a
highly advanced civilization

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that has something
that none of them have.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I see humans.

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I haven't
lost faith in humanity

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
or this and that.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
people who get caught up,

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
like you said before,
they are also contributing

01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to that, because they are
going so deep, so far away,

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
like fractalizing
all the way out,

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.290 align:middle line:90%
as far as they can stretch.

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they bring
all of that with them

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
as an experience
that is going to be

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%
integrated in the collective.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what all of
us also are doing.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:12.380 align:middle line:84%
In my perspective, we
are exploring this realm,

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and then sending
it back, informing

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the other counterparts,
informing the oversoul,

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.170 align:middle line:84%
informing the vacuum,
as Nassim Haramein says.

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's constant
variety and uniquedness,

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
as they say sometimes
that is what

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
is good about being
here on the planet.

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, we
are a collective.

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And at some point
we are going to be

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
a collective consciousness
that is going to harmonize.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's our unique
perspectives that

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
are making this whole experience
something else entirely.

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that needs to
be appreciated no matter what

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
level somebody is on.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like with reptilians
and Pleiadians, or Arcturians.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:02.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you very much for
being in the middle of nowhere.

[LAUGHING]

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.398 align:middle line:84%
So I can come and visit
you and do this interview.

01:15:09.398 --> 01:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad we
finally got to do it.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward
to future stuff.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Keep us posted.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.650 align:middle line:90%
How do people find you?

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Vashta.com.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Vashta.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> They can find links to
my Facebook, my YouTube,

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
my everything on that website.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
seeing more cool art,

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where that goes,
and maybe future channelings?

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.610 align:middle line:84%
That's very, very possible
the way it's going right now.

01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.634 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:15:34.634 --> 01:15:35.938 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:15:35.938 --> 01:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm really glad that
I got the chance to talk to you

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
as well, to meet you, and to
participate in your awesome

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:42.570 align:middle line:90%
project.

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
