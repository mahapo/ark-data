we'll be entering into soon.

they will start

you will slowly, basically be
acclimating to their frequency

Their reality is merging with
our reality, and all of this

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:90%
is like a climatization process.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's acclimating
to their frequency

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
so that we can best
meet them in the middle.

Eventually, these
first-contact ambassadors

will all get very used to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%

with greater planetary shifts.

>> So I'm going to start
with just when I was younger.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And in retrospect, I didn't know
that the experiences that I was

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
having when I was younger
were actually setting me up

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
for the work that I'm doing
now and to become more --

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot more consciously aware
of these different types

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'll start with that.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I was younger,
I was pretty obsessed

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of different types of
metaphysical, paranormal stuff

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and specifically, aliens.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times when I was
younger, I would stay up late,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and I would watch shows
like "Ancient Aliens"

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and these different
kinds of things.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It was very matter
of fact to me.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.172 align:middle line:84%
I would watch the show,
and I would just kind of

00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
be like, oh, well, of
course this is how it is.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course aliens exist,
and of course they've

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
been influencing our society
for thousands of years.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:90%
How could you not believe this?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember
that oftentimes,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I would stay up late at night,
and I would wait by my bedroom

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
window.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Or there was a kitchen
door at a house

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that I grew up in that
had a big screen door.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I would wait there, and I would
wait for them to pick me up.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what that meant,
because I was still young.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe between the time
I was eight and 10 or whatever.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what that meant,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning my conscious mind
was confused by that,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.043 align:middle line:84%
but there is a deeper
thing that was happening,

00:05:02.043 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
a deeper recognition
that was happening,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that these experiences
were occurring,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:90%
or something was occurring.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that
they were experiences.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a notion that, OK,
they were coming to pick me up.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a few experiences that
I remember when I was younger.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
When I was about
eight, I remember

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
fall asleep one night.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I would put
my head on my pillow,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.505 align:middle line:84%
I could hear two
voices whispering,

00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were whispering
to each other.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.592 align:middle line:10%
They were deciding something,
but it was about me.

00:05:44.592 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't discern
what they were saying,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
but I could just
hear them whispering

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:90%
as I had my head on the pillow.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I would spring out
of bed, and I would

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
look around thinking,
I don't know,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I would catch them in the
act of talking about me

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.153 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Might find them
in your closet.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd open the closet
or look under the bed,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and they would be there.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I would
do that, it would stop,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and this went on
for the whole night.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I would go
in throughout that night,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and I would wake my mom up
and be like, there's angels.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:90%
There's angels in my room.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I perceived them as being
two different energies.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
There was two energies
that we're talking,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
context that I had.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:90%
It was angels.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, they were angels,
because what is an angel?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a benevolent
being of light,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and that was my sense about it.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't scared so
much, but I was curious,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.907 align:middle line:90%
and I was confused, I think.

00:06:43.907 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What did your mom
have to say about that?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.157 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember,
to be honest.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how she
actually responded to that.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Does she know about
your work now, and your--

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean she is very aware.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Is she supportive of
what you're doing now?

00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:90%
She's really supportive.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> She's had she's had her
own experiences and stuff.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
she said at the time.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so there was a few
things like that that happened.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Any memories of--

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:10%
you said you'd wait for
them to pick you up.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Any memories of them
actually picking you up?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> No memories of
that, as far as--

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.585 align:middle line:84%
well, and actually, it's
funny, because as I've

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
become a lot more aware
of these experiences,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had these very
interesting experiences where

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm viewing myself as a
kid from a third person

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:90%
perspective talking to them.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> They're like memories.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing me through
these other parallel past

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%
realities of me as a kid.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So I have had experiences
like that, but none

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that I was consciously
remembering from a first-person

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
perspective at that time.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting that
they would show you from that

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
perspective, that you would
show yourself I should say.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I show myself.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I've had a few of those.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.595 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward to
when I was a teenager.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was very
atheist and very almost

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
against anything that was
outside of the sort of idea

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that you're just
a person on Earth,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and you live, and you die, and
whatever, and no one cares.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
I was very much
in that attitude.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
a lot of dark stuff

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%
when I was a teenager.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I went through a lot
of drug addiction,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a very
dysfunctional relationship,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and hanging out
with a lot of people

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that were doing
things that were not

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.794 align:middle line:90%
in integrity and in alignment.

00:08:36.794 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't seem
like you at all.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem -- but it
was who I was at the time,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, OK. and
when was this at?

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>> This was from the time that
I was 14 to the time that I was

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:48.005 align:middle line:90%
17.

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where did you grow up?

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I grew up in Connecticut.

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:52.666 align:middle line:90%
>> In Connecticut?

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, and
just in the suburbs.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I was just in Hartford
a couple of weeks ago.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Or a month ago.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I just played a gig in
Hartford like, a week ago.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sweet.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So I went down this
very negative path,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of shut
all of that stuff out.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I was an active non-believer of
these kinds of things and was

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.213 align:middle line:84%
very against the idea of there
being some sort of greater--

00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:22.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Extraterrestrial,
or [INAUDIBLE]??

00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just some
sort of greater set.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, power, because in
that state that I was in,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I felt so abused, and
neglected, and misunderstood,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and abandoned that I kind of
shut off the idea that there

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:90%
was anything else out there.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I guess if you're going
through dark times, then yeah,

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that's usually
what you would do.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how it is, and you
tend to shut those aspects

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of yourself off, and
you feel abandoned.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So amongst all of that,
something that was a big

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
turning point for me, which was
that I got accepted to my dream

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
college, and that was a
music college called Berklee,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.715 align:middle line:90%
and it was in Boston.

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the school,
everything started to change,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
because all of a sudden, I was
immersed in my passion 24/7,

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and that was like the light
at the end of the tunnel,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and I really felt myself
changing for the positive.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
started to happen was

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that I would have spontaneous
out-of-body experiences,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and I would go
lucid in my dreams,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and that was not anything
that ever happened to me.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.958 align:middle line:84%
I might have heard about
lucid dreaming once or twice,

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
know anything about it.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It just spontaneously
started happening to me.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
The first conscious
contact experience

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that I had was in my
freshman year of college.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I went out of body,
and I found myself

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
in the city, what I was
perceiving to be a city,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot of
people walking around,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't really
like any kind of city

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen before.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to say what
even it looked like.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It was more of just the
feeling of it being a city,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and that's how I understood it.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking
up, and over the city,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
there was this giant
energetic field.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a purple, shimmery color.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking up there,
and as I was looking up,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
this massive ship just kind of
came through the energy field.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking
at it like, whoa.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
As that was happening,
I became aware

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that there was
someone talking to me,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that there was someone
having a conversation.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
This person was trying to get
my attention, like, hello.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Are you still listening?

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I kind of felt my attention come
back to looking straight ahead

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.555 align:middle line:90%
>> To the voice, or--

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> To the voice, and I realized
that there was a little man.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
he was maybe a little bit--
he was maybe five feet tall --

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:90%
or 4'9" or something.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And he had a huge
head, very human-like,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
but just a larger head,
no hair, our color skin.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember he was talking
to in and I sort of

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:90%
in a a half-remembered dream.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to
his words, but I

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really understanding
what he was saying,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
but I remember having
the thought alien.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I had that thought,
the experience ended.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, and that was the
first conscious experience

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I've ever had with
an extraterrestrial

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:90%
that I remembered.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what do you think--

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
do you think that was life
on another planet, another--

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a good question,
and I don't really know.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know, but I will
say that he was, from my sense,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
he was part of one of the hybrid
races, the Yahyel, most likely.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, because you're more
familiar with the energy--

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.195 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm more familiar.

00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I sensed that he was part
of one of the hybrid races,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and those are the beings, the
Yahyel, Essassani, the Hybrid

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Children, these beings
that, for a lot of people,

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.275 align:middle line:84%
they've heard Bashar
talk about them.

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
These are the beings that I
interact with a lot, the most

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
regularly, and I'm most
familiar with their energy.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
After that experience,
I kind of went back

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
into researching and obsessing
about paranormal stuff,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials, and UFOs.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the path that
I went down, which

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is the path that a lot
of us go down at first

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
is more of that
conspiracy ufology.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
What is their intention and
what are the scientific facts?

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:90%
And all that.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And the chemtrails, and
the fluoride, and the--

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And the chemtrails, and
the fluoride, and the--

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the government
cover-up and the secrecy, yeah.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And the secret underground--

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The conspiracy
theories, yeah.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all of that.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went into that, but
that was an important gateway,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:84%
because it opened me up to
understanding that there was

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
more out there, and that it
gave a little bit more validity

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:90%
to my experiences.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So throughout that time,
for about a year, I

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.428 align:middle line:84%
was kind of in denial as to
what was happening to me,

00:14:18.428 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and I would have these little--

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So it would continue?

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It was it was continuing,
and I would have these little

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.568 align:middle line:84%
There'd be like, 10
seconds or 20 seconds

00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
where it would be in
the middle of the night.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Flash.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I'd be in another reality.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It would be some
version of my bedroom,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and there would be two or three
ETs at the foot of the bed.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And a flash, it would be done.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And that happened, and I was
continually sort of in denial.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Am I making this up?

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
we go through when

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
we start to first
have these experiences

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and when we start to
spiritually awaken.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Am I crazy?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:10%
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.932 align:middle line:84%
So the turning point for me
was that I read this book,

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and it was called "An
Invitation to the Dance."

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:84%
it was written by an
experiencer named Steve Jones.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Steve Jones.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It was an amazing book.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
He talked a lot
about his experiences

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
which once again,
validated my experiences.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing
that he introduced

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to me was the concept
of universal love,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and that these beings
were messengers of love,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that these beings were
here to assist humanity,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:30.825 align:middle line:84%
reunite with these cosmic beings
who are a part of our family.

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
He talked a lot about
the hybridization program

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
as well and a lot of
these things that then,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
when I later found Bashar,
he was talking about, too.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And just the idea of practicing
positivity and becoming

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
more loving, implementing
that into your into our lives

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
was a huge key for me, because
then it was no longer just sort

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of accumulating facts
about extraterrestrials

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:90%
or about metaphysics.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It was more starting to embody
that and live from that place.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So my heart was more open, and
I was more spiritually aligned,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.748 align:middle line:84%
and I was I was
wanting to change,

00:16:14.748 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was wanting to open up
to these experiences more.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The first time I take
psychedelic mushrooms,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I had a absolutely,
insanely profound experience

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that really shaped the
course of what now I

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:90%
understand my work to be.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I
took the mushrooms,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:90%
and my intention going--

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I was with the right people, I
was in the right environment,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I had the right intention.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Set and setting.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Set and setting, totally.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
was extremely profound

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
about the experience
is-- of course,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever
taken psychedelics,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
you come, and you're
sensitive, and you're aligned.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
You come into the
space of realizing

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
everything is one, and
that we're all connected,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and all these beautiful
universal truths.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that really
changed everything for me

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
is that there was a
guy that was there

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
who was sort of inadvertently
acting as a guide.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:90%
He was very spiritually in tune.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:10%
He was only there for
two days, and he--

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Was he helping to facilitate
the ceremony in a way?

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, in a sense, but
it wasn't like so official.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure, sure.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.197 align:middle line:10%
>> He wasn't a shaman.

00:17:31.197 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:10%
He just was a guy who
was really in tune,

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:10%
and he knew how to help guide.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So he was showing me how to
move energy throughout my body,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and we were making
these energy balls.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:84%
A huge turning point for
me was that I remember

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
making an energy
ball in my hand,

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and I could see it as clear as
I see you, and I was hearing it.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I could hear the
oscillation of it.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.897 align:middle line:84%
I could see the colors of
it, and the veil was removed.

00:17:59.897 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I was perceiving all
these different things.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that came
to me in that experience

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
was God is real.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything that
I pushed away or everything

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that I denied for such
a long time was there

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.795 align:middle line:90%
in that experience.

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing that happened.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.837 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
that happened was

00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that I started to be
contacted in that experience

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they were
contacting me telepathically,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and they were utilizing the
people in my environment

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.922 align:middle line:90%
to deliver messages.

00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:10%
The people in my environment
didn't necessarily

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:10%
know that that's
what they were doing.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:10%
In their own subjective
version of reality,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:10%
they were just talking.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:10%
But no, no, no.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.707 align:middle line:84%
In my version of reality,
they were talking, and--

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as everything
is a reflection.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as everything
is a reflection.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Higher dimensional energies
will use us as conduits

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to deliver messages.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing was
like, this is real.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We are contacting you.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:90%
It was very direct.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They were like, you
are here on this planet

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
at this time as part of
a galactic federation,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
a council who is here to uplift
the vibrational frequency

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and you're going
to help just by living, just

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
by being you, and being
in your highest vibration

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:90%
and your highest alignment.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
help assist humanity

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in reuniting with
their galactic family.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.453 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a good thing that
they put that, just by living,

00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:10%
because to just say, you're
here to assist humanity,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:10%
that's a big burden to receive.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I think at the time, I didn't
know so much what that meant,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
because I immediately went,
OK, what do I have to do?

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Who do--

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Now I've got this huge.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Who do I have to call?

00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to call the president?
like I was in that position

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.117 align:middle line:90%
where I was like, I don't--

00:19:50.117 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But of course,
over the years,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I understand what it is now.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But at that time, they
also said, just be you?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They were just like,
you-- it wasn't even be you.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.505 align:middle line:90%
It was like, you are this.

00:20:00.505 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't be anything else.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%
you are our ambassador.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:90%
You are here assisting us.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:90%
We're your family.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:10%
You can't mess this up.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:90%
You just gotta be you.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good, that's good.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't so much
verb, always verb.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.075 align:middle line:90%
It was more of a feeling--

00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:19.908 align:middle line:90%
>> A feeling, right.

00:20:19.908 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>> --And an understanding.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Then a funny thing
that happened was

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that from that
point, my friend, who

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
was guiding the experience,
who I was mentioning,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
he was wanting--

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.452 align:middle line:84%
we were in an
apartment in Boston,

00:20:34.452 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to go
walk down the street,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
because he was going to
some building or whatever,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and he asked me if
I could go with him.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, after just having
that contact during the--

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I was still tripping
on mushrooms.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But right after that,
that happened right

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
after the telepathic
communication.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And so he asked me, oh,
could you come with me?

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Can you show me where this is?

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And to my perception
in that experience,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought that he was going
to take me behind a building,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and we were going to
get in a spaceship,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:90%
and we were going to fly away.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I was confused, I was scared,
but I was kind of like,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, I guess this is it.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.155 align:middle line:90%
I guess this is it.

00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Time to go.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I didn't have the
same context for what was

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.845 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the same
understanding that I do now.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
OK, I guess we're

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
going to go on a
spaceship and fly away.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It was your first
mushroom trip, right?

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.147 align:middle line:84%
>> It was my first mushroom
trip and just first opening up

00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:90%
to all these things.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But after that experience,
it was total 360 change

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
over night.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:10%
I shifted my diet
completely, I started

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:10%
to really get serious
about meditation,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:10%
and implementing different
spiritual practices,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:10%
and just really walking
the path and wanting

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:10%
to become this embodiment
of higher consciousness

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:10%
to assist in
humanity's evolution.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
started to live that.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's been many, many years
since that has happened,

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and I've created
a lot of content

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and put out a lot
of content that

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
has been inspired by this
message and by my experiences.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:90%
At this point--

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that led us to this.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It led us to this.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.087 align:middle line:84%

was very creative.

>> It is, yeah.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm an artist, and
a musician, and I

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
know how to utilize all
this technology and stuff,

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
so that's kind of how
I've packaged it together

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and presented it.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, I mean, I
have experiences multiple times

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
a week, and I've had hundreds
of fully conscious, fully lucid

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
experiences with a
lot of different types

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of it, honestly, I
don't always like talk about

how my experiences, necessarily.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I talk a lot about
the messages that

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
have come from the
experiences, but yeah,

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.387 align:middle line:84%
some of the stuff that
I've experienced is insane.

00:23:06.387 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we get into that,
I just want to double check.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%

>> And then what happened?

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well and then just that
experience just really

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
solidified and set the stage
for the work that now--

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:90%
what I'm doing now.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, galactic ambassador.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the galactic
ambassador role,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.207 align:middle line:84%
which looks like a lot of things
and nothing in particular,

00:27:11.207 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:90%
which is how put it.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.498 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
funny thing, too, is

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
like, I think that for people
that have these experiences,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and they go through a
spiritual awakening,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and they feel that
responsibility to help,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we think that it looks
like a certain spiritual career

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
or it looks like a certain
thing, but it's not, really.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just whatever--
it's however

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:90%
you choose to express yourself.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It's however you feel
is the way that you

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
want to represent yourself
and what is really, truly

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with you.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the path, so it
doesn't look like anything.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned that
over the many years

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
since that experience
and since that awakening.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were saying these
contact experiences now are

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:90%
quite common.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So since that, I mean, I've had
hundreds and hundreds of fully

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.873 align:middle line:84%
conscious, lucid
experiences with ETs

00:28:10.873 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
where I could touch them,
I'm talking to them,

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I could see them, and all
sorts of stuff is happening--

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Without the aid of mushrooms.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Without the aid of anything.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:90%
They just happen.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And they generally--

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
before I get into the
specifics of the experiences,

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll just talk about sort of
the general protocol of how

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:90%
they occur.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So for me, they generally happen
in the middle of the night,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and it will kind of be like a
spontaneous shift in reality.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll be falling asleep,
falling asleep, and boom,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll find myself
in another reality.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's blatantly
obvious that I'm on a ship.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is like a version
of my bedroom or a environment

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that my consciousness
feels comfortable within.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's sort of this
countdown of like 3, 2, 1.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're about to appear.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, not all the times,
I first won't be able to move,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be lying down.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it will start
with them holding my hand

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.965 align:middle line:90%
or touching me somewhere, and--

00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you feel actual pressure?

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel pressure.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I feel them, and they are like.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.815 align:middle line:90%
can we be here with you now?

00:29:21.815 --> 00:29:22.615 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:29:22.615 --> 00:29:23.415 align:middle line:90%
>> They ask?

00:29:23.415 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> They'll ask,
and they'll ask me.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:84%
That will sort of set the stage
for what's about to happen.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And so generally at
first, I can't move,

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:84%
because there's sort of
a climatization period

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.650 align:middle line:84%
where I'm adjusting
to their energy.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't move,
because I'm slowly

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:90%
getting used to the feeling.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Generally, until I
balance myself out,

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
it's like you kind of feel
like you're vibrating out

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.872 align:middle line:84%
of your skin, and you
can't really talk.

00:29:59.872 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:90%
You get very choked up.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.372 align:middle line:84%
Like if you've ever been very
emotionally moved by something,

00:30:03.372 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
you feel it in your throat.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
You quite literally
get choked up,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
sensation at first.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a lot
of like nerves,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of kinds
of feelings that happen,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and then it kind of settles
out, and they're there,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're usually
smiling at me.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have experienced
a lot of different types

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.623 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials, and all
of them feel very differently.

00:30:26.623 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, I interact

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
with the hybrid beings, so
I am used to their protocol.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.073 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times, they're
just like medical checkups.

00:30:36.073 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll bring me
through different procedures

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:84%
where they'll be activating
certain parts of my energy body

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and realigning me in
certain ways, and--

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that's
to communicate with them?

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think those medical
alignments are to be a better

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:90%
communicator?

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, yeah.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
They're primarily
adjusting the energy body

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
so that the frequencies that
are coming onto our planet now

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
can be assimilated more
efficiently by my being,

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:84%
both on a physiological level
and on a quasi-physical and

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:90%
metaphysical level.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost
like a tuning fork.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're helping
me to fine tune.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do the work here,
I have the experiences,

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and they help, and
then I come back here,

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and then so on and so forth.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:90%
And then you set the waves here.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And then other people get
activated like me coming to you

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:90%
for this interview and what not.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of generally
how those experiences happen.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:84%
My last experience
that I had with one

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.118 align:middle line:84%
of my friends, who is part of
this Sasani group, came to--

00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:49.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he have a
name, he or she?

00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sometimes he does.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he d--
it's kind of like,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.013 align:middle line:90%
it's one of those things where--

00:31:57.013 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have names in the
same way that we understand it.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They will give the
contactee a name

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
so that we can familiarize
ourselves with their energy.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, because they're so
unified and they work as one,

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.902 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's like, are you
this being or that being?

00:32:14.902 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're like,
that doesn't matter.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That doesn't.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:84%
That's-- because we operate
as one collective mind.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I mean, he came
to me, and he was smiling.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me
if he could come.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the experiences
are very intimate.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like, kind of--

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
even though they aren't
necessarily sexual,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
they're like kind of treating
you like a romantic partner.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They're very intimate, and
they'll hold your hand.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like being nurtured in
this very intimate way when

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:90%
you're with them.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually
showing me how

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to like sleep in a certain
way so that I could--

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
neck and back stuff,

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
because throughout
my journey, having

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to like assimilate
some of these energies

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and because of my experiences,
too, it's put a lot of strain

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
on my neck and my
back, because those

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
are like powerful reciprocal
points of the body that

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:84%
integrate these higher energies
so that energy comes down

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:90%
through your spine.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he was helping
me to sleep in a certain way

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and bring more awareness
to how I'm sleeping,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and where to actually place
my pillow so that I can more

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.445 align:middle line:90%
effectively not injure myself.

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was an
interesting experience.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And then there's been--

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many, but there's

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.842 align:middle line:84%
some that are even
more unbelievable.

00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:84%
That one was pretty
mundane in terms of--

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so to
the other extreme.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Go--

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --what's some of
the unbelievable ones?

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Another one was actually--
it was the one that I was

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
mentioning.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> With the reptilian?

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
With the reptilian--

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's--

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --which was a
cool story, I think.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So experience another way
that these experience starts

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
is that I become lucid, and
I'll be looking out a window.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:12.511 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking out the
window, a ship will appear,

00:34:12.511 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:84%
and so that's how
this one started.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I looked out, there was a
ship there, and it was like,

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:90%
OK, I know it's about to happen.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:18.249 --> 00:34:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm looking at the
ship, and it's like, boom.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And my consciousness gets sucked
into what felt like a portal.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:90%
So then there's a flash.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.241 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that feel like?

00:34:28.241 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Like you're flying down--

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, you know what it's like?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
you're flying down--

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.683 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever been
to a water park,

00:34:37.683 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and you go down one
of the water slides.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Tubes.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're in a tube.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.358 align:middle line:84%
And you're in that
enclosed space.

00:34:42.358 --> 00:34:43.775 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
what it feels like.

00:34:43.775 --> 00:34:44.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:34:44.575 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But more intense and
more defying of space-time.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:84%
One moment you're
flying backwards,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
drop-- you're falling,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to
explain exactly.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.110 align:middle line:90%
That's a great analogy.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So flash, and I'm in a
room, and there's two beings.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.355 align:middle line:90%
One of them is a shapeshifter.

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm just calling, because--

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> A shapeshifter, because
you were shapeshifting.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Because he was--

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:90%
he was shifting.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one
was this very tall--

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
like, maybe 9, 10 foot tall,
lanky, green, reptilian,

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:90%
humanoid being.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, very lanky, and was
wearing a priest robe.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were
basically bringing me

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
through an energetic
clearing process.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reptilian
was using this thing

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.823 align:middle line:84%
that was, in my
perception, was like sage.

00:35:38.823 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were clearing
the energy field,

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and they were clearing
the energy field.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting because they

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:84%
started to do all this
dental work on me.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.152 align:middle line:84%
This energetic dental
work-- that's the only way

00:35:49.152 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:90%
that I can really explain it.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.943 align:middle line:10%
>> With machines,
or just energy, or--

00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:53.600 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it was like--

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.480 align:middle line:10%
it was like somehow with ener--
and they were moving my mouth

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:10%
in a certain way.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
tell if they're using

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
some sort of mechanical--
energetic, mechanical device,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
or it is just with
consciousness.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.990 align:middle line:84%
In those realms, those
lines are very blurred.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:10%
>> But they were doing this,
all this kind of stuff,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:10%
and I remember as
this was happening--

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:10%
and in my experiences
now, I'm just--

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.640 align:middle line:10%
I don't ask questions,
I just sit there

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:10%
and I just let them
do what they do.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Because the more that
I try to ask questions,

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:10%
it creates this sort
of seeking energy,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:10%
and it agitates
the energy field.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're not able to
maintain your consciousness

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
for nearly as long
when you start

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.003 align:middle line:84%
to, like, what is this, who are
you, bah bah bah, bah bah bah.

00:36:41.003 --> 00:36:42.785 align:middle line:84%
It gets too much into
the chatter mind.

00:36:42.785 --> 00:36:43.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:36:43.355 --> 00:36:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So you just--

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It pulls you out
of the experience.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.808 align:middle line:84%
It pulls you out
of the experience.

00:36:46.808 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So you just learn to
kind of relax into it,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.930 align:middle line:90%
and just let it be what it is.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was laying there, and I
see, in the corner of my eye,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian
walked from the bed

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:90%
to the other side of the room.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And as he was walking back,
he was going like this,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and he was covering his eyes.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:90%
And I asked the other one--

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I was like, why is
he covering his eyes?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was a combination of
telepathic communication,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:84%
audibly, and also just
direct knowing that it was--

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.320 align:middle line:84%
they were concerned that
if we made eye contact,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:84%
it would trigger something
energetically that

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
would be overwhelming for me and
overwhelming for him as well.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And what was explained, or
what I knew in that moment,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
was that the group
that he was from

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:84%
was healing a lot of
wounds with humans,

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:84%
as well as humans healing a lot
with the idea of reptilians.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And the conflict between
humans and reptilians--

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
the entanglement between
humans and reptilians and the--

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Perception, maybe?

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hard to explain.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's more just like
the misunderstanding

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.910 align:middle line:84%
between reptilians and
humans is one of the oldest

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:90%
histories of our galaxy.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And so there's a lot of
wounds that need to be healed

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, if we had
made eye contact, there would

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
be this energetic force
that would happen,

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that it would be
too much for us.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So he was covering
his eyes respectfully

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.637 align:middle line:90%
towards me and for himself.

00:38:27.637 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating,
because then what happened

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
was that he laid on
the foot of the bed

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and he held my hand and--

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
so you have to imagine a
hand that is three times--

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:84%
two, three times
the size of mine--

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Very soft.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Some slight scales, but
really, really soft.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding his
hand and I'm like,

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
first of all, just amazed by
the feeling of what that is--

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> --physically.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And he starts to
bless me, and he

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:84%
starts to say this prayer, where
he's like, may he be blessed,

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:90%
may he be free, may he--

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.958 align:middle line:90%
and he's going on.

00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:10%
And then he says something
that was really interesting,

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:10%
and this is how the experience
ended, where he said, may he--

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:10%
but it was me, but it
was meaning mankind,

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.250 align:middle line:10%
he said may he look upon the
face of the lizard people

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:10%
as they once did in
the ancient times.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Meaning may we see reptilians
in the divine light

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
as we once did, earlier
in our galactic history.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And all of that
was, once again,

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
it was like he said that, but
all of that was understood

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.850 align:middle line:90%
by me in that experience.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So that one was
quite fascinating.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And you see, we have these
ancient monuments that were--

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:84%
in Gobekli Tepe, they're
finding the serpent statue--

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the Serpent
Mound in North America.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There's all this serpent
symbology that seems to be held

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.035 align:middle line:90%
in a very sacred manner--

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:05.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:05.835 --> 00:40:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> --in old, old times.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> This is pre--

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
the modern day image of an idea
of what a reptilian or serpent

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:90%
type energy is.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've had quite a
few experiences with these

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.940 align:middle line:84%
reptilians, and it's understood
that they ask me to do this

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very comfortable
with interacting with all

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:90%
different types of beings.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.427 align:middle line:84%
Some look very unusual, some
basically just look like us,

00:40:32.427 --> 00:40:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes their
skin color is different,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes are a
bit bigger or whatever.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm put in these
experiences because I can bring

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of healing to that
timeline and that lineage,

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not afraid
of these experiences,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
even though there's some like--
whoa, OK, this is intense,

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:90%
when this comes up.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:90%
There's not judgment.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And that has come through
having so many of these

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.760 align:middle line:84%
experiences over a
long period of time.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, in my own work,
I've noticed that too.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>> If you open yourself up--

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:90%
for me, it was a mantis being--

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --having, sort of not
judgment, but curiosity.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Then yeah, they
kind of come--

00:41:17.523 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they're like, oh,
this guy's not afraid.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:90%
We can show ourselves.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and we can--

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:84%
he can assist us in
this healing process.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then later-- for me,
yeah, I felt amazing,

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love from this
mantis being and this image

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:84%
of the insects, which
is-- we have this--

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's this
collective trauma

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
in some way from
insects and reptilians

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and these things
that we're all--

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
we think, oh,
that's gross, and we

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
create, in our monster
movies, we create all this--

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, totally.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.332 align:middle line:84%
There's all that stigma
around those kinds of forms.

00:41:53.332 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, we've got to sort
of work through that a little

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:90%
bit--

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> --to connect.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>> And they're just forms.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:10%
They're just form.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.818 align:middle line:10%
>> They look-- like the
rock, like the tree,

00:42:02.818 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:10%
they're just other forms.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When you connect
to the actual energy,

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
it's, like you said,
unconditional love.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It's amazingly loving, and
they're fantastic to be around.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Every time I have an
experience, I'm just like,

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I come back from
that experience,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just ready to go.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel recharged
from that, because

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of the pure positive
energy that's generated

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:90%
from my interactions with them.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned
the Essassani being--

00:42:28.515 --> 00:42:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you didn't mention
his name, but do you

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.312 align:middle line:84%
have any other regulars
that visit you often?

00:42:32.312 --> 00:42:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, there's a
whole group of them that are

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Essassani and then
there's one being--

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they talk like Bashar?

00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Not--

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] you
know what I mean?

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's funny, because
I've had three conscious

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:90%
interactions with Bashar.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
The entity Bashar.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And those have
been very interesting.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:10%
The first interaction
that I had with him,

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:10%
I knew that it was him, and
he was explaining to me how

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:10%
their civilization
is excited to learn

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:10%
from polarity through humans,
in the way that we're learning,

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:10%
and that he--

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:10%
he showed me an experience
where he was with his group,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:10%
and they were
exploring some planet,

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:10%
and they ran into this
local indigenous--

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.002 align:middle line:10%
almost like an octopus-type
being, and they had some--

00:43:24.002 --> 00:43:25.460 align:middle line:10%
the reason why they
were showing me

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:10%
was because they were
demonstrating how polarity

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:10%
happens to them, which is
that they didn't understand

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.670 align:middle line:10%
this being, and
the being latched

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:10%
onto one of the people
that were in their group,

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.180 align:middle line:10%
and they had to have this whole
procedure of removing the being

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.650 align:middle line:10%
without hurting anyone.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
lessons in there for them

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:90%
in that experience.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that was
quite interesting.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that is fascinating.

00:43:50.608 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And then another experience
I had with him, I was actually--

00:43:54.890 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:10%
I was clearly in Sedona, and
this is also at the time--

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:10%
as I'm living in Sedona, but
I went into another reality

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:08.900 align:middle line:10%
where I was in Sedona, I saw
his ship, I'm on the ship,

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:10%
and I'm laying on a
bed, and I can't move,

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:10%
and he's wheeling me, and I
can see out of their ship,

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.350 align:middle line:10%
and I could see Sedona from
their ship, which was--

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Nighttime or daytime?

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.790 align:middle line:10%
>> What's that?

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Was it nighttime or daytime?

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It was daytime.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Daytime.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.987 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:44:25.987 --> 00:44:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So you have these interactions
with the Essassani,

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:90%
and these different--

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.980 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
regulars with them.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
another regular,

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.560 align:middle line:10%
named Marlin, who's from
the YahYel civilization.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> He's a little bit taller
than me, completely bald,

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:90%
looks pretty much totally human.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.642 align:middle line:84%
There's some-- if
you saw him, you'd

00:44:45.642 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
be like, that guy kind
of looks a little weird.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But he's not-- the
YahYel look very human--

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> --and their features are
a little bit accentuated

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.880 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.840 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that energy like?

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:90%
The Essassani--

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's, once again, really
peaceful, really loving.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:08.390 align:middle line:10%
But it's very human, it's very--

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.870 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't really feel very
extraterrestrial in that sense,

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:10%
with the YahYel.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> You say that, and I've--

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people say that, and
I hear that, that they're--

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.607 align:middle line:84%
even Bashar talks about
being the first contact race,

00:45:22.607 --> 00:45:23.690 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And interviewed Bella--

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But the way they come
through different people,

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Wieteka and Arjun,
it's a little subdued.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:90%
But you have these other--

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:84%
like Shaun and Gita, and other
YahYel channelers out there,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:84%
it comes through very
heightened and excited and--

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's very excited.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --hyper.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, but that's
so far from the human!

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But see, the thing is, what
I mean by it's human is that

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:90%
it's the true humanity.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like the core essence of
the human, which is excited,

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
passionate, and aligned
and connected, and--

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Because a lot of people
who aren't in this world,

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.210 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, they
may see that and like,

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.200 align:middle line:90%
what is this silliness?

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's because most people
don't operate in that state.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:10%
But as you start to operate
more in that state of alignment

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:21.070 align:middle line:10%
and excitement, it's like,
that's how you become,

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:10%
and that's how you
feel a lot of the time.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.995 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm interacting
with them, I'm feeling good

00:46:26.995 --> 00:46:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're feeling
good, and they're excited

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited, but that's
just how I feel all the time.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So they're reflecting back
to us the true essence

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.850 align:middle line:90%
of our humanity.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And they themselves
consider themselves humans.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They're not earth humans,
but they're humans.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many interactions
with a lot of different groups

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.680 align:middle line:90%
that are like--

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:84%
when I'm like, well, how
do you identify yourself?

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.693 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, we're human.

00:46:50.693 --> 00:46:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't live on
earth, but we're human.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.510 align:middle line:90%
We're part of the human family.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's-- definitions.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything gets
wound up and twisted,

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and part of the
human experience is

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to put labels and
definitions on everything.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always trying to
figure out those YahYel.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of sneaky in the
sense of-- because they are

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.310 align:middle line:84%
so connected to us,
but yet they're--

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.410 align:middle line:84%
what are they, and
trying to figure out

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.940 align:middle line:90%
which timeline they're from.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, they're a lot
more similar to us

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:10%
than you might think at first.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a favorite?

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> A favorite being?

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.462 align:middle line:84%
>> A favorite civilization or
group that you hang out with?

00:47:37.462 --> 00:47:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all different
in their own respects,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to play favorites
in that sense, because it's--

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, it's a bad question.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's fine.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just like who is
wanting to interact with me?

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I would say that I'm
the most comfortable

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
with the Essassani
and the YahYel,

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:84%
but there's so many
other interactions

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with all
different types of beings that--

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.700 align:middle line:84%
they're all very
interesting and unique.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you interact with
the hybrid children a lot.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, a lot with
the hybrid children.

00:48:10.182 --> 00:48:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> At what age groups
do they come through?

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Some are between 17
and 20, based off of our--

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Understanding.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> --how we're perceiving age.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.570 align:middle line:90%
And some are infants.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Some are 6 to 10.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And at an infant,
they can communicate?

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more-- when
I'm with the infants,

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.680 align:middle line:84%
it's more like I'm
nurturing them.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm just helping
the other caretakers--

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:90%
caretakers, being the--

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Other YahYel, or other--

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Other-- the Essassani,
the YahYel, the Sha-YahYel,

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.080 align:middle line:90%
which is the fourth group--

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, right.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.982 align:middle line:84%
>> --based off of Bashar's
understanding and information.

00:48:47.982 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You said in nurturing
for the younger ones--

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.250 align:middle line:90%
what about the older ones?

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What kind of interactions
do you have with them?

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> With the older ones, a
lot of the time, it's like--

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.770 align:middle line:90%
it's all very playful.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:04.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an element
of play, and there's

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
creative activities

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that happen when we're together,
and there's a lot of talking

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and oh, I'm excited
to do this with you.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of sharing of
what we are both collectively

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:26.070 align:middle line:90%
excited about.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Which would be?

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:28.495 align:middle line:10%
For example-- Just
depends on the time?

00:49:28.495 --> 00:49:33.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, like, oh, I'm excited
to go be in nature with you,

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.550 align:middle line:10%
or to create with you, or to
do these different things.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mutual exchange
of what they're excited about

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm excited about.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And there's also a lot of--

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:90%


00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.260 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they
don't say anything.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
They just will look
at you and smile.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'll have
experiences where they'll

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.880 align:middle line:90%
make fun of you sometimes.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Playfully, not harshly.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.870 align:middle line:90%
But I remember that I was--

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't move when I was
with one of the beings that is

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.090 align:middle line:90%
actually one of my daughters--

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And she was looking
at me from above,

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was making these faces,
because I couldn't move,

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:90%
because I was paralyzed.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And she was making those
faces back at me and laughing.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.390 align:middle line:10%
And it was a very
visceral thing.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very visceral, yeah.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> So you have daughters.

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Daughters.

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You said S, with an S.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's like, the
way that we understand having

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.980 align:middle line:84%
daughters and children is a
bit different than how these

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:84%
experiences, or how their
understanding of it.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we donate
genetic material--

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> --energetically
and physically.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.407 align:middle line:84%
And different beings are
created through this donation

00:50:55.407 --> 00:50:56.240 align:middle line:90%
of genetic material.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.905 align:middle line:84%
That's the
hybridization program.

00:50:57.905 --> 00:50:58.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:58.705 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And those beings 100%
consider their genetic donors

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:middle line:90%
as their parents.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Fully.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Like mommy and daddy.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Just like we consider
our parents parents.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.590 align:middle line:10%
And so we don't
always consider--

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:10%
>> But caretakers?

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.190 align:middle line:10%
How does that--

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:17.523 align:middle line:10%
>> The caretakers are different
extraterrestrial groups.

00:51:17.523 --> 00:51:18.323 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:51:18.323 --> 00:51:20.560 align:middle line:10%
And would they consider
them parents at all?

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they consider
them caretakers.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Like we would-- like a nanny?

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Actually, yes.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a good analogy.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And those beings kind of act
as like surrogate parents,

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and they will take care of
them, and they will teach them

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:42.230 align:middle line:84%
what they need to know until
the time is upon us where

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.350 align:middle line:84%
those hybrid children
will inhabit our planet

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and share the space with us.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And from that point,
we will teach them

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.950 align:middle line:90%
in whatever way is necessary.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we also teach
them a lot on the ship.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:54.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.922 align:middle line:10%
>> And when I say teach, it's
not so much like, OK, class,

00:51:57.922 --> 00:52:00.380 align:middle line:10%
here is a lesson, and you're
writing stuff on a chalkboard.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.240 align:middle line:10%
It's like you're teaching
them through your experience.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And they basically have
this protocol where they can go

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.560 align:middle line:84%
through your experiences, they
can access your experiences,

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because your experiences
are stored in the cells

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.000 align:middle line:90%
of your body and in your DNA.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And they can access
this, and they

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
can learn from accessing
this information.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
ways that we teach them.

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the teaching is
very dynamic and will

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.450 align:middle line:84%
change as they are actually
physically with us.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And as they evolve and
understand those teachings too.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that
we're teaching them,

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot that they're
teaching us as well.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.888 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think the time--
is there a time frame on when

00:52:42.888 --> 00:52:44.180 align:middle line:90%
all this is supposed to happen?

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Dates don't really work
with this kind of thing,

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:90%
because it's always--

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.880 align:middle line:84%
there's many parallel
realities, and there's

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.380 align:middle line:84%
many different
versions of Earth.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
versions of us.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
shifting, depending

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:90%
on what we're choosing.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But one thing that came
to me that was very important

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to express was that
in this next decade--

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.750 align:middle line:84%
sometime within
this next decade--

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.650 align:middle line:84%
for certain groups of people,
small groups of people--

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.440 align:middle line:84%
because first contact
happens in phases.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:84%
We're in phase one of
first contact, which

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.670 align:middle line:84%
is the remembrance of
the fact that there

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.900 align:middle line:90%
is even anything outside of us.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's a phase
two of contact, which

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.110 align:middle line:90%
we'll be entering into soon.

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And this phase two is
that basically, they

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:36.500 align:middle line:84%
will start to appear physically
to certain groups of people.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that it's
going to happen is maybe

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you get called to
go hike somewhere,

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and at first you see a ship.

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that was quite profound.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I see a ship.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe a month later,
you see that same ship,

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.617 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a
different nature spot,

00:53:51.617 --> 00:53:52.700 align:middle line:90%
and you see the same ship.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're like, OK,
I recognize that.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've also had
experiences where

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.050 align:middle line:84%
they've shown me their
ship, and they're like,

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:90%
describe that to me.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:84%
They will ask me to describe
it to them, so that what

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.700 align:middle line:84%
their ship looks like
is ingrained in me,

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:84%
so that when I see that, I
will immediately recognize that

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.910 align:middle line:84%
as beings that I
am familiar with.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So you'll continue to maybe
have these different sightings.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And then eventually, you
might go somewhere and one

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of the scout ships will
be landed somewhere.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> In a field--

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> In a field--

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:30.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, this is
general, because it's

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.110 align:middle line:84%
hard to get into specifics
because it's going to happen

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:33.950 align:middle line:90%
different to everyone.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe you see that
ship, and you see it,

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's profound,
and it's amazing,

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they'll, in some
way, communicate with you.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe a month
later, you see that same ship

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll see
them standing there,

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe two months later,
a year later, the same thing

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:84%
will happen, but they will
actually come over to you,

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and they'll actually
hold your hand

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and they will actually really
physically embrace you.

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The point of--

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:06.043 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is part of this--

00:55:06.043 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
raise our frequency--

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to raise our--

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> --in order to match them.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.390 align:middle line:90%
They can only lower so much.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And then eventually, we get
to that place where we can hang

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.190 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is like
a climatization process.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It's acclimating
to their frequency

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we can best
meet them in the middle.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So the point of
what I was saying--

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of
giving some examples--

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.700 align:middle line:84%
it's like at first, the
experiences will be sparse.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, they'll
be little sightings.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Over that period
of 10 years or so,

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you will slowly, basically, be
acclimating to their frequency

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.920 align:middle line:90%
in a more physical way.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And then, eventually--

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about
lots of people, right?

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Having these things.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking
about lots of people.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:55.212 align:middle line:90%
Because I know a lot of--

00:55:55.212 --> 00:55:57.532 align:middle line:84%
I know, in this realm
and doing this work,

00:55:57.532 --> 00:55:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
are already having

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.360 align:middle line:90%
these experiences like this.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.202 align:middle line:90%
So what I'm saying that--

00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's more global.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.042 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying that on
a more global level.

00:56:05.042 --> 00:56:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's going to--

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:11.310 align:middle line:84%
on a global level,
and in this reality.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Their reality will--

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Not so much in a dream--

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Like what you're
experiencing now

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:19.250 align:middle line:84%
is in this not
physical realm here.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:22.533 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more in a quasi
physical kind of capacity.

00:56:22.533 --> 00:56:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> A dream sense, or--

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.580 align:middle line:90%
But even though they're--

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:84%
it's still as real as
I'm talking to you,

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.170 align:middle line:84%
but I consciously recognize
that it's not in this reality.

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:32.647 align:middle line:90%
>> It will be, though.

00:56:32.647 --> 00:56:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And their reality is
merging with our reality.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But there needs to be a
process of acclimation.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, these
first contact ambassadors

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.430 align:middle line:84%
will all get very used to
interacting in a physical way.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And that timing will
correlate with--

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The ambassadors on
earth, or their ambassadors?

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, both.

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's more so about
us getting used to them.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty used
to us, because they

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:90%
interact with us a lot--

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot, a lot.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We just don't remember.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So this will coincide
with greater planetary

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:13.220 align:middle line:84%
shifts that will eventually
lead to open global contact.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And open global contact,
meaning they're here,

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.950 align:middle line:84%
they're part of our
society, they've

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:20.680 align:middle line:90%
integrated into our society.

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that eventually, we will
become part of a greater

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:90%
galactic council and society.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like things that are
depicted on Star Trek?

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Very accurate, in the sense
that however many years from

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.930 align:middle line:84%
now, in our future,
in our lifetimes,

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:84%
we will be part of this
greater galactic community,

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be exploring
outside of our planet,

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be interacting as
first contact specialists

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to other societies as well.

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:53.097 align:middle line:10%
>> So do you think we're
in this timeline right now?

00:57:53.097 --> 00:57:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think-- so we're
in this 10 year span?

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Fully.

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.475 align:middle line:90%
>> We can get started?

00:57:56.475 --> 00:57:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, fully.

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Because yeah, we have--

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.820 align:middle line:84%
just a couple weeks
ago, the Navy,

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.865 align:middle line:90%
with the announcement that--

00:58:03.865 --> 00:58:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you caught that--

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:10%
What was that?

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's sort of a continuation
of this To The Stars Academy,

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the New York Times announcement
two years ago, that--

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and the release of these
three videos from the Navy.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Official videos--
they're saying--

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:24.470 align:middle line:90%
UAPs, right?

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified aerial phenomenon.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.373 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
they're E.T. or not.

00:58:28.373 --> 00:58:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying they're
E.T., but they're not

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:90%
from this planet.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --basically.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're getting
this in little bites.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Tucker Carlson
interviewed Donald Trump

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and said, what's the
deal with the Navy stuff?

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you believe in aliens?

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.923 align:middle line:10%
>> And he's like, well, I
don't believe in aliens,

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:48.120 align:middle line:10%
but I believe our Navy guys.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.797 align:middle line:84%
>> And then a week later,
the Navy comes out and says,

00:58:51.797 --> 00:58:53.005 align:middle line:90%
they're not from this planet.

00:58:53.005 --> 00:58:53.805 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah.

00:58:53.805 --> 00:58:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not UFOs, but they
are not from this planet.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.605 align:middle line:90%
Officially.

00:58:58.605 --> 00:59:00.230 align:middle line:84%
In the three videos
that they released,

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.120 align:middle line:84%
officially, fully--
they had already

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.190 align:middle line:84%
been sort of vetted
in everything,

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.690 align:middle line:84%
if you do your
homework, but there

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:07.010 align:middle line:90%
was no official announcement.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And now it was official.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Now it is.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is definitely a
step in the right direction.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And this will sweep
the world by storm.

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.115 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had storm
Area 51, right?

00:59:19.115 --> 00:59:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.002 align:middle line:10%
>> Just a couple
weeks ago as well.

00:59:22.002 --> 00:59:23.710 align:middle line:10%
>> As if it couldn't
be any more blatant.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But it will take
the world by storm.

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Also, global
contact won't happen

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.795 align:middle line:84%
until humanity is at a certain
level of energetic integration.

00:59:36.795 --> 00:59:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning they're not going
to come land if we're still

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.710 align:middle line:84%
at war, fighting,
dah dah dah dah dah.

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.835 align:middle line:90%
But the good news is that--

00:59:43.835 --> 00:59:45.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that would
just create more--

00:59:45.502 --> 00:59:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That could just
create more polarity.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It would create
a lot more polarity.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's not the agenda.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.405 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not the agenda,
and it wouldn't be helpful.

00:59:52.405 --> 00:59:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're on the
ascension timeline,

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and this is happening.

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Ascension is happening.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And the timeline that we
are on is peace on earth.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:09.410 align:middle line:10%
And of course, all
of us will always

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.510 align:middle line:10%
be at variant stages
of where we're

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.020 align:middle line:10%
at in our own integration,
but generally speaking, when

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.580 align:middle line:10%
the planet reaches a certain
threshold of positive focus,

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.040 align:middle line:10%
then global contact can happen.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And no dates,
nothing like that.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.418 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's happening, and
it's going to happen soon.

01:00:31.418 --> 01:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are going
to really come to a head,

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
this next decade,

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
we will see a lot of completely
paradigm shifting things

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.210 align:middle line:90%
happen in our society.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of people
who are in this space,

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
they want it now.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we know in our
bones that it exists,

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
we've had these experiences,
and we're just like, hurry up.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But we seem to forget
that it is happening.

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It is happening.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And we forget, too,
that it's a process,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.070 align:middle line:10%
and it has to be a process,
because of what all of this

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:14.880 align:middle line:10%
entails--

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.600 align:middle line:10%
what this all entails
physiologically,

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.950 align:middle line:10%
what this entails energetically,
what this entails socially--

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.240 align:middle line:10%
all of these levels.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's big stuff.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If it happened
overnight, it would be so--

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
it'd be like eating a hot
chili pepper or something.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'd probably have
to go to the bathroom.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:38.760 align:middle line:10%
That's a good way of saying it.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And you wouldn't
retain any of the--

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You would not.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.133 align:middle line:90%
>> --any of the nutrients.

01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And it wouldn't be
for the benefit of all.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It really wouldn't.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gradual process.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Though, at the same
time, it's happening,

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
continue to accelerate.

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe a good reminder
to everybody who's watching--

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.045 align:middle line:90%
>> It's already happening.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:01:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It is already happening.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.225 align:middle line:84%
>> We're having this show,
we're having the conversation,

01:02:00.225 --> 01:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
there's people watching,
we have an audience.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.930 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Just sit tight.

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Sit tight, seriously.

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.630 align:middle line:10%
>> It's happening.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Any other thing you want
to add to that, to final--

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The message is
about love, man.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about creativity,
it's about unity,

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's about coming together
as a global consciousness

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.452 align:middle line:90%
and as a global community.

01:02:24.452 --> 01:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the message of
these extraterrestrials are.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It is truly that we're all
connected, we are all family.

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And when we're able to put
aside our own personal agenda,

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and we're here--

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
we really allow ourselves to be
here, and be present with being

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
of service to the planet.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:51.075 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, that just
simply means a lot of things.

01:02:51.075 --> 01:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%
But I'll say it like this--

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we hear that a lot.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.457 align:middle line:90%
>> We hear that a lot.

01:02:54.457 --> 01:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so to clarify
this, in closing,

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
being of service to the
planet is being vulnerable,

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
it's being authentic, it's
being honest with how you feel,

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, and it's
about allowing yourself to love

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
how you feel, to the point
of your feelings becoming

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
integrated and
harmoniously balanced.

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That is the first
fundamental level of service.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
emotional integration,

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
it's what are you
inspired to do?

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you put your
service into action

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.560 align:middle line:90%
in a practical, physical sense?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.108 align:middle line:84%
Like what you're
doing with the show,

01:03:35.108 --> 01:03:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and with what I'm doing with
the YouTube channel, and the art

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:39.370 align:middle line:90%
and the music and everything.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Then for us, as artists,
it's simple, it's easy,

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
because artists have this
free pass to do whatever.

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> How could you--

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.330 align:middle line:90%
any ideas for somebody else?

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I love that question.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Say that you're a mom--

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.600 align:middle line:90%
a single mother.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
That is just as
significant as the artist--

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
an artist who's doing stuff,
creating art about E.T.s.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So your job as a single mother,
whoever is watching this

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and is a single
mother, your job is

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to raise your children with
the utmost love, compassion,

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
gratitude, and nurturing
energy, and to allow

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.600 align:middle line:84%
them to be free, and be fully
expressed in who they are.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Now that is as a powerful
planetary service,

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and that is
something that shifts

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the whole paradigm
of parent and child,

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:37.590 align:middle line:90%
or say that you're someone--

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
you're a business owner.

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> To run a business that is
ethical, that's of integrity,

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that is wanting to be about
connections rather than just

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
about how much money you make
and how much you can get from

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:53.250 align:middle line:90%
someone.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:56.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Having these
little shifts are as--

01:04:56.753 --> 01:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
these are the things that
are changing the paradigm.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to be an artist,

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.967 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be
a spiritual healer.

01:05:01.967 --> 01:05:03.270 align:middle line:90%
That's like a big--

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
a thing that a lot of
people get confused

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
with is my planetary
service has to look like me

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
being a spiritual healer.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.078 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't look like
anything in particular.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It literally just
looks like you being

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
more loving, more vulnerable,
more authentic in being you.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And sharing that with others.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
There's so many opportunities
throughout the day

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to anchor in a higher vibration
of love and compassion.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:32.190 align:middle line:90%
So many.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when you take
those opportunities,

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
you are being of service,
in all of these little ways.

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
In the way that
you treat yourself,

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you talk to
yourself, in the way that you

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
talk to other people.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:44.950 align:middle line:90%


01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It's in the simple
things, that's

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%
how we change the paradigm.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to
be E.T.s or going--

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No, none of that.

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> --into inter-dimensional
planes of existence.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And people get really--

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.538 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons why
I don't always share--

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I've shared a lot of my
experiences in this interview--

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I don't usually
share a lot of my experiences.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I make art that has come
from my experiences,

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the message
behind these experiences,

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
but I don't always talk about
my experiences themselves,

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
because people get
very caught up in that.

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's a play.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm having these
experiences, but I'm also

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
seeing through the one that
is having these experiences.

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:25.140 align:middle line:10%
So it's also a play that
when you see through it,

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.740 align:middle line:10%
you're integrated into an even
higher level of consciousness

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.240 align:middle line:10%
and understanding
and embodiment.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So don't get wrapped
up in the experiences.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not about talking to
E.T.s, it's about love,

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's about
alignment with yourself

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and sharing that
with other people.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, at
this point in my journey,

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so willing
to have my heart open,

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you never get disappointed,
because you're not

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
loving towards someone
because you expect

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
them to return the favor.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:06:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You're loving towards someone
because you know that the love

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that you're sharing with
someone is fueling you,

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:07.740 align:middle line:84%
it's fueling your being,
and you're helping to raise

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of our
planet by embodying that.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So for me, at this
point, it's just--

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I have an open heart, and
I share that with everyone,

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and I can see people's
realities changing, just

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
by me sharing love with them,
and just by being myself

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and expressing myself with
excitement and compassion

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.600 align:middle line:90%
and passion with what I'm doing.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> The unconditional love.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what it is.

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you say when a lot
of people who open themselves

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.610 align:middle line:90%
whole heartedly--

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:46.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes they feel taken
advantage of, or they get

01:07:46.365 --> 01:07:47.400 align:middle line:90%
in a rut.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You can only be taken
advantage of when you have

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
an expectation of how someone
should be in response to you.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't mean being
around people that are going

01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%
to abuse you.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean get yourself
involved in sketchy situations.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
What it means is
that when you're

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:09.618 align:middle line:84%
truly in integrity, first
of all, you sense deception.

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
If someone's intentions
are negative towards you,

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.687 align:middle line:90%
you develop that sense.

01:08:12.687 --> 01:08:13.520 align:middle line:90%
You could feel that.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You go, hm, maybe I don't
want to be around that person.

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you have no
expectations of how someone

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
should respond towards you,
as you're being loving towards

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
them, then you can't be taken
advantage of, because you have

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
no say, you have no need
for them to be anything

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.439 align:middle line:84%
You're just like, you
can be disgruntled,

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
you can project tons
of things at me,

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to love you.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And to some people,
that sounds crazy,

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, why
would you do that?

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you really understand
this, you become invincible.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Like, truly.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.939 align:middle line:84%
People's projections
and their negativity

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
stops affecting you
in the same way,

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:55.503 align:middle line:84%
because you're the first one
to show it love and compassion.

01:08:55.503 --> 01:08:56.670 align:middle line:90%
You're, like, oh, you just--

01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, that person
just yelled at me.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:06.279 align:middle line:84%
That's an indication of how
much more love they need.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Or just where they're
at in their evolution.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just a
simple observation that

01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:14.059 align:middle line:84%
they're working through their
own things, and that's fine,

01:09:14.059 --> 01:09:14.859 align:middle line:90%
love you.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
I send you love.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And you said invincible, but you
also kind of become invisible.

01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Invisible as well, yeah.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.910 align:middle line:84%
That's another way
to look at it, yeah.

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of where
the idea of attraction

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
comes in, too, where you're
attracting new realities,

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
because you become invisible
to the old realities that

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
are based in manipulation
and ego and all these things,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.149 align:middle line:84%
and you enter into new
realities with people

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
that are of service
to you, because you're

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:40.819 align:middle line:90%
of service to them.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And worlds collide
to make things

01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:50.045 align:middle line:84%
happen for you, as opposed
to worlds colliding--

01:09:50.045 --> 01:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> To go against you.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.878 align:middle line:90%
>> --to go against you.

01:09:51.878 --> 01:09:53.000 align:middle line:90%
And to spite you.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
On an individualistic
level, that might happen.

01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But on a, like you
said, a world level,

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
it's all-- the world is
conspiring to uplift, to grow,

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and to integrate.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But individually,
we're our own demise.

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> We are.

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And the other
level to that, too,

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is that you start to realize
that you are the world, meaning

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that there's many
versions of the world,

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and where you are
at vibrationally,

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
energetically, you
are matching yourself

01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to this gradient of different
versions of reality.

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So the more that
you are consciously

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
choosing the
version of the world

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.478 align:middle line:84%
that you want to be
in, the more that you

01:10:38.478 --> 01:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
will see the reflection of that
in these versions of people.

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Said very well, as the
true galactic ambassador would

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.603 align:middle line:90%
probably say, right?

01:10:49.603 --> 01:10:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, thank you for the
love you're putting out,

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:54.330 align:middle line:90%
and your art--

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, man.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.562 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for doing this.

01:10:55.562 --> 01:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%

YouTube videos, everything.

And continue to
share this message.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think you hit it
on the-- you hit the nail

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
on the head right there.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, awesome.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> So thanks, brother.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.360 align:middle line:90%

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.530 align:middle line:90%
