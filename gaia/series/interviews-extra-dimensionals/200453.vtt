00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So for me, the light language
began signing through my hands.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Like a sign language.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I was working on clients.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I had had an
Axiatonal alignment.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And after that, when I
was working on clients,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
my hands would start
to move around.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And so I just watched it.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
were-- it was silent.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes were closed.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
It was lovely.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was how
it began for me.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And that was the easy part.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Because when the sound
wanted to start coming out,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I was really reticent
with that at first.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But of course now I'm glad
I got over that hurdle.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So each hand-- does each
hand movement have a word

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
or a sentence to it, or--

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So with hand movements-- and
this could apply to something

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
verbal, spoken or sung as well,
but especially with the hand

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
movements, what I notice is
there are times where my hands

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
are actually writing light
language in the energy field.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So it would be the same
as if it was on paper,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's just in the air.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It's in a three-dimensional
plane there.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there are other
times where my hands are just

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:90%
moving energy.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:90%
They're responding to it.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes it'll
go into like a mudra.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Other times it might
go over a chakra,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
or it might just
hold and stabilize

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:90%
some energy that's flowing.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But the hands are kind of a
simultaneous language that's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Something's coming
out of my mouth.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the part
that's either verbal, audible,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:90%
or visible.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there are times
where I'm seeing language

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:90%
coming out of my eyes.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I've seen it
coming out of my elbow

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:90%
or out of my throat.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'm hearing or seeing
languages that they're not

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%
audible or visible.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>> And do you see when people
write light language in the--

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:10%
I've seen some other channelers
write light language,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:10%
and it looks almost like an
alien writing or something.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
dialects, you know?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of it looks
similar to some things

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that we might know,
like kanji or Sanskrit.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Some of it looks very different.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.008 align:middle line:90%
Some of it looks more symbolic.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are the symbols
you see when you're transmitting

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you see those
actual symbols, or--

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes I'll
see symbols, yes.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And it can vary.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.003 align:middle line:90%
It can be different languages.

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
they're clear to me,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're
just moving too fast.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was so
many of them, it's

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
not like I was seeing individual
glyphs or anything like that.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.472 align:middle line:90%
But it was there.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And there was stuff.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.888 align:middle line:84%
Was it coming out
your elbow today?

00:05:40.888 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, it wasn't.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.865 align:middle line:90%
That was like a whole immersion.

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Almost like an explosion of
light, in a positive sense.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, it looked beautiful.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It sounded awesome.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You said yesterday,
in the past you've

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
channeled many different
types of entities,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.334 align:middle line:84%
but today I think we're
going to focus on Areon.

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Can you just briefly,
before we go in there,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'll ask them
the same thing.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But how did that come
about, and what--

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
who are they, I
guess, in a sense.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.183 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask-- I'll ask
them who they are.

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But how did you start the
process of channeling Areon?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had been
channeling for many years.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was often
different energies

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
that were coming through.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And in, I think it was November
of 2012, Areon came to me

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and said, we'd like for
you to channel us directly.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Because our information
can be helpful to humanity

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And they even said,
humanity's on a trajectory.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
They're on a timeline
that is now--

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
our information can
be more helpful.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think getting so
close to that 1212 was--

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
at that time, we were ready
for a deeper connection

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
in with our heritage, that
had always been there,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.620 align:middle line:84%
but we were just ready
to bring it out more.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And they like getting
into the details

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:90%
of the mental and emotional.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So they brought through
a beautiful channeling

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was alone, by
myself, in a room.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was such a loving energy.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that
energy that of course I

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:90%
was willing to do that.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's been really
wonderful channeling them.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
At that time, I said yes.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like I ran,
and I'm like, OK, well,

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing one this weekend.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was getting
settled into other things.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And I connected with
a friend of mine who

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't told any of that to.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I had seen that they
were connecting with me,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and they were--

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
every couple of weeks, I
would tune into their energy.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
forming their name.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And they had
identified themselves

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:90%
as the Lyran Council of Time.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't--

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't asking for a name.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I figured that's how
they wanted to be known.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
But they I kept seeing
the letter A, and I knew

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
they were creating the name.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't see
the whole thing.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So I was chatting with a friend.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's very good at
getting names like that.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
We've had a lot of
synchronicities in that way.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't told him
anything about that.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.497 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I can
see these energies

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to you.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
They're forming a name.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you get their name?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, no.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.405 align:middle line:84%
I can't see their name, but
I'm seeing the letter A.

00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yes, yes.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'm getting too.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So a few weeks later, they
came to me, and they said,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
here's the name we want to use.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's Areon.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And they showed it
to me spelled out.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And I complained.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.616 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:02.616 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:03.945 align:middle line:90%
Why did you complain?

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a healthy skeptic.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Oh, does that really
have to be the name, you know?

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.865 align:middle line:84%
What if some people
think it's Aryan,

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and they have negative
connotations with that.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, no.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the name.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And they
just left it at that.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they were explaining to
me at that time that the reason

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
they wanted that name, the
A-R, it represents air, energy,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:90%
the mental, the subtle energy.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:84%
They deal a lot with the
mental and emotional.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And then eon, you know,
that makes sense time, time.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Time, yeah.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So they left it at that.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And then about a couple
of weeks, a month later,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:90%
they came back.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And all they said was
now spell it backwards.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So A-R-E-O-N spelled
backwards spells "no era."

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So timelessness.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.235 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was like, oh.

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:03.035 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go, yes.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was glad they
let that time lapse--

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:90%
ba-dum-bum.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But I was glad
they let that time lapse.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it made it
more important to me.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes we feel like
we want everything right now,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes this beautiful
physical experience,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
when things happen
over phases in time,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:90%
that was even more special.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So I really liked getting
to know them in that way.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I look forward
to talking to them.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can
bring them through.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:11:02.948 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.948 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Areon.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Blessed be.

00:11:09.515 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a few questions today.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.632 align:middle line:84%
I've been spending a
lot of time with Jayme

00:11:13.632 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and getting to know her
and getting to know you

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:90%
guys through her.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to communicate
in this way, in this fashion.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
First off, I wanted to ask,
from Areon's perspective,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.627 align:middle line:90%
what is time?

00:11:29.627 --> 00:11:30.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Time is an important
aspect of the experience

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:90%
that you are having.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
From your density, you
experience the linearity

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So your past is complete,
your present is now,

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and your future has
not yet occurred.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We do not like to start by
saying time does not exist,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
because the experience of
it exists in this reality.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you
understand that deeply,

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
then you can integrate into
the next level of truth

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:90%
or understanding of time.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Time is a function
of your density.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Because movement
is constant, you

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
experience linear time
because of the speed

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
at which you move
and experience.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So your biomechanism helps
you to linearize time.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to
linearize experience.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And time is the effect of
the speed of your movement.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
When you observe the
things that are around you,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
you see some that move fast
and others that move so slow,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:84%
you would consider that
no movement at all.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:90%
The rocks around you.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
You do not see them move in
the same way that you move.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a definition
that separates them

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:90%
from your experience.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Because the pace is different.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:90%
The density is slower.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Time is the effect of the
pace of that movement.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So as you understand
the experience

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that you are having slows
time into its linear form,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
you can then utilize the subtle
aspect of it much more clearly.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to
teach this in ways

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that help you understand the
linear aspect applies, and you

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
can start to add other
layers of application.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So where we usually begin
is the understanding

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that within your present
moment, your past exists now.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:10%
All of the experiences that
you have had in your life,

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:10%
all of the experiences that you
have observed from others, all

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:10%
of the experiences through
the genetics of your DNA, all

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:10%
of that past is in
your present moment,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:10%
because it has created
the defined experience

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:10%
that you are having.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Within that present
moment, your future already

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
exists now because the choices,
the actions, the inactions, all

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that you are experiencing
in your present

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is aligning you with
future potentials.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:90%
So time is part of you.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
It is part of this density.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:10%
And as the density changes, the
rules of time change as well.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
But it is for you to
change within and release

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
the resistance so
that you can flow

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
more easily with the
non-resistant, nonlinear

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the timeless
nature that you are.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So I was going to--

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking as you
were describing time.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And in past episodes,
I've covered

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
the different density
levels, rocks and plants

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
sort of being at a first
density, second density,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:90%
and third density.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And different channelers have
slightly different reference

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:90%
points or charts that they use.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But we all have this word,
density, and density levels.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Would time-- it seems
that time is associated

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
with these density levels.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We like to differentiate
between how you verbalize

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
dimensions and how you
verbalize densities.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions are a set of
rules that are helpful

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
only because of
your perspective.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Density considers the overall
resonance and interaction

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:90%
of those dimensional rules.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you consider
your density,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
you are creating an overview
of how the interaction occurs.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Your third density,
which is where humanity

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
has been residing and
resonating for a very long time,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
your third density helps slow
you into enough separation

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that you see the
movement through time,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
you experience the
movement through time,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's fast enough
to mark those time frames,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
but it's slow enough that
you can get into the details.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Your fourth density, where you
are crossing over and merging

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
back and forth and blinking
into and out of, depending

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
on the individuals, their
individual perspectives,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
your fourth density is still
separate in physical form.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
It is still slow enough
that the effects of time

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
are still there.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But there is a resonance
that is more consciously

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
subtle rules of magnetism

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the overall
resonance to determine

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:90%
rather than just control.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
When you are shifting
into that fourth density,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
you are starting to interact
with time in a different way.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is the connection
between your Mayan calendar.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
indigenous and ancient cultures

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that marked these
points, that understood

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
the overall cycle,
the cycles that

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.960 align:middle line:84%
are so long that humanity could
not easily see them moving.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So your fourth density, you
begin to understand life

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:90%
from more connection.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see some
of those longer cycles.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You begin to feel some
of those differences

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
in movement where the
duality of opposites

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is more connected
into one experience.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I am
moving fast, and I

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:90%
feel like I'm moving slow.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in time, and
I feel my timeless nature.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Your fourth density
begins to connect.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the exciting
point that humanity is at now,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
where they start to
experience more connection.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
They start to
experience more impact

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
from their overall resonance
because the expansion that

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is occurring is creating
more connection within.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So the intuitive signals
are starting to open up.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
The deeper thread
of connection is

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
starting to become more
apparent, or the lack thereof.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So the opposites are either
felt as more connected

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
or they are felt
as more drastic.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Part of the aspect
of that connection

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
creates a sense of a
stronger separation

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:90%
or more polarization.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is that aspect
that helps give

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
the perspective of new form.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
You see this in your
cellular structure

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as it separates in order
to create new form.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is the process that
humanity is now experiencing.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Where is there
separation, where is there

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%
opportunity for connection.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what
separation shows

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is how a deeper or a stronger
connection can be created.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There is still physicality
within that fourth density.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So for some, the experiences
are not drastic enough

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:90%
to sustain the believing.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it is so important

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
for the inner experience, the
subtle bridge, the thoughts

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions, to
become much clearer.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So that each being is
connecting within the self

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and with the invisible that is
not necessarily already formed.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And that part that you are
experiencing now, some of that

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
comes with understanding
time more deeply,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
relaxing into the
resistance that

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
resists the future potentials
or resists the present moment

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:90%
or holds tension from the past.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Part of that is the
strengthening of the self

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
so that what is going
on around and seems

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to be more separation
or polarization

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:90%
does not distort the beam.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So the density that
you are moving into

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
will still have
physical separation

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and yet more of a
connection within the self

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and within the subtle realm.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It seems that--

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:84%
well, first off,
let me ask, what

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
density does this Areon
consciousness that I'm

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:90%
speaking to now reside in?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We have moved beyond density,
and we bridge back and forth

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:84%
between non-density,
non-physicality,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and enough density to
be able to communicate.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The Lyran connection
with this, there

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
is Lyran aspects that
have moved beyond density.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:10%
So from your
numerical system, you

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:10%
would consider us 7th density.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:10%
Some would call us
different densities

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:10%
or might use different numbers.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Yet from our standpoint, we
are no longer in physical form.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And even our densest nature does
not hold physical separation.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:84%
That may not be true for
all Lyran experiences,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
but the energetics that
you are speaking with now,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:90%
that is our resonance.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Other episodes, you said that
Earth is a seventh density

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Would that be a little bit
different than Earth itself,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:10%
the collective
consciousness of Earth,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:10%
is a seventh density being,
is that in the realms, or--

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The consciousness of Earth?

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:10%
I see.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:10%
So we-- a similar consciousness
then to our planet, with--

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:10%
and I guess the way
I see that is all--

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:10%
not just humanity, but all of
the different consciousnesses

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:10%
that reside on Earth, the
plants, the animals, the rocks,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:10%
all the unseen
realms and dimensions

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:10%
that we don't necessarily
even see or all of us

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:10%
come in contact with.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
All of that combined together
in this grand consciousness

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.150 align:middle line:90%
called Earth.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's on that scale
that we're talking to

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:90%
with the Lyrans, or bigger.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It is as if there are
layers within layers.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the words
sometimes become difficult.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it is helpful
to understand it

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective and then
add another layer of truth,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:84%
another layer of truth,
another layer of truth.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
There are aspects
of consciousness

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that one could almost
always consider

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:90%
the highest density available.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It is not always true.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
There are aspects
of consciousness

00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that will sustain more of a
density level of separation.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of moving
through and integrating

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the overall consciousness
experience so

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that the ultimate creation or
resolution has a purer form.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it keeps
reforming itself

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:28.335 align:middle line:84%
until there is that clarity
that can no longer be refined.

00:25:28.335 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness of
Earth holds many levels.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are levels that can
communicate or can sustain

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
physical form that integrate
but would be considered separate

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And there is that separation.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:90%
There is that depth of density.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And there is that higher density
or lack of density as well.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
They all exist.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It is just like
the nature of time.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
You experience the
separation of it,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
but it is all existing
at once as well.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And to expand, well, I
guess what part of this global

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
ascension, this global
transformation that's happening

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
on the planet right
now, is us, humanity,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
awakening to these
unseen realms,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:84%
these subtle things that
we're just talking about.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, it seems this
cancellation of the polarity,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
this knowing the
other side of the coin

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and operating from a
place of non-polarity,

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
or I call it trinity
consciousness,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
the third choice, I say
a lot in my own studies,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:90%
in my own language.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.105 align:middle line:84%
And is that what's happening
here with this ascension?

00:27:33.105 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And could you talk about
the ascension a little bit

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and in your words?

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Ascension is a
very natural process.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It is just like plants that grow
through seasons or humans that

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
grow from child into adult.
It is a very natural process.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And what you are
experiencing now

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
is where the expansion
of your understanding

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of the subtle realms is
becoming more conscious to you.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You've always been
interacting with them,

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:84%
but the resonance
was not strong enough

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to sustain the focus or the
clarity of connection within.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is
important to observe

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
the subtle bridge, the
thoughts, and the emotions,

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:84%
so that you are tuning in to the
inner realm, the subtle aspect

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of self, that
communication bridge

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
between your physical nature
and your non-physical nature.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So what humanity
is experiencing now

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
is an expansion into more
of that conscious connection

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:90%
with the subtle realm.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So it is a matter of then
tuning in to the self, creating

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:84%
more ease and flow
and strength within,

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:84%
more personal empowerment,
more flow of love,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
but from that strength that
understands the conditions

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
of the physical realm.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Because your unconditional
nature is your subtle realm.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It is your inner realm.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That is where you heal,
you find forgiveness,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you find new perspective
of connection.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:84%
You nurture the self into
more wholeness and strength.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:84%
That then creates a
different resonance

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that is interacting
from physical

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to non-physical in a more
empowered, conscious,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and direct way.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It often begins by focusing
on creating with your thoughts

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is healthy
understanding.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
much more of a depth,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
of learning to navigate the
inner realms, whether it seems

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:84%
like it's a positive or if it
seems like it's a negative, one

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
is choosing, as you say, the
third direction, the third way,

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the third option, which is
to connect those opposites

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to become
one coin within the self.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We often use the example
of your atomic model.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Within the nucleus
of an atom, you

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
know there is a
positively charged proton,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
there is a neutral
charged neutron.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:90%
That creates that core within.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And if it does not have that
balance, it is unstable.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:84%
It can still create form
in this physical realm,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:90%
but it creates unstable form.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But when that is balanced, the
positivity and the neutrality,

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
this is the metaphor
of the self, when

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:84%
you are equal in your positivity
and equal in your neutrality,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
your relaxed, your
openness, your patience,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:90%
your willingness to experience.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
When those are equal,
that is a stable core.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And then that negatively
charged electron

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is drawn to that, which
would seem like opposite,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.770 align:middle line:90%
but it is the wholeness.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It is the two sides of the
coin that creates new form.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is within all
that you experience,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
this metaphor, this pattern
of the atomic model.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The 99% space, 1% matter,
that is your density as well.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:90%
You are 1% physical matter.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:84%
You are 99% invisible,
subtle, non-linear.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to tune
more in to the invisible,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:84%
whether it is the thoughts
and emotions first,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:84%
it is the potentials
of the future.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
tune into that more,

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:84%
you begin blending the 1%
form and the 99% invisible.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You start utilizing that
vast, subtle, invisible engine

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.111 align:middle line:90%
that forms this world.

00:32:36.111 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is what your
ascension process is.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You are aligning
the physical self

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:84%
more with that 99%
invisible aspect of self.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So what then is
that aspect of self?

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have many
names for this.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Some call it God.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Some call it oneness.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Some call it unity.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Some call it consciousness.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Some call it life.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the connective
force of life.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, from your emotional
standpoint, what connects?

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
You could say it's love,
in many different aspects.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.030 align:middle line:90%
That might be friendship.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It might be family.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It might be a shared passion.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:90%
But it is a connective force.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It might even be a shared anger.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Because that opposite is
part of that whole coin.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you called that
coin love, on one side,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.340 align:middle line:90%
that love may feel like bliss.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of that coin,
that love may feel like loss.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.040 align:middle line:90%
But those are one coin.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It's all love.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
you are learning.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You are learning to
have the strength

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to navigate the
positives, and you

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
are learning to
have the strength

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.380 align:middle line:90%
to navigate the negatives.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having resistance
to either one of those,

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
you are learning to
have the strength

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:84%
to navigate the connection
of both of those.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So first, as one
opens, they often

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:84%
pursue that through
that aspect of love.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.639 align:middle line:90%
Well, I want more positivity.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I want more love.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I want more bliss.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So I will give more love.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is effective.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:90%
It is part of it.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But often, what starts to
happen is they find that that

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:84%
resonance cannot be sustained,
and that also is perfect.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It is that negative
electron creating

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.570 align:middle line:84%
more wholeness that seems
like there must be a problem.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I've lost that flow of love.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But that is life creating
more wholeness within.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
That is life helping
you to create new form.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So that what seems
like a negative

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
is actually a completion.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the other
side of that coin.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
strength is developed

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through
that flow, it

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
seems as if there
is less negativity.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
In essence, that is true.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.650 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, there
is a layer of truth

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that that negativity
is still occurring.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It is that it is not
resonant with the being,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
or the things that might have
felt more negative to them

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
before now are part of
that strength that says,

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:90%
ah, this is just completion.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.920 align:middle line:84%
This is just a new
opportunity for form.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So the process of ascension
that you are going through,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, is a mental
and emotional one first,

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and then it becomes
a physical one.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is not to say that
your physicality will disappear.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
That is not the phase of
ascension that you are in.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
You are in a phase
of integration

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:84%
where the separation will still
be there, with more connection

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%
consciously.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's fourth density.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That is fourth density.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> So I-- it seems--

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I like to say everything
is a two-way pump.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So it has to go in
and come out in order

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to flow, to neutralize
the two sides of the coin.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of the analogy
you just said, to give

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:90%
is to receive, and vise versa.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't overly give, otherwise
you deplete your own source.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wanted to
go back earlier.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:50.915 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that the
Lyran collective had--

00:36:50.915 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:57.815 align:middle line:84%
correct me if I'm wrong--
but had already done all

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of the separation that it could
do, [LAUGHS] then it finally--

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it
was able to ascend.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what we're
doing in our sense?

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:90%
We were trying all the hats on?

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It is what you are doing.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are aspects
of each of you

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that have experienced this
process in different ways.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:84%
There are aspects of the
self that are more connected.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.810 align:middle line:84%
There are aspects
of the self that

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:90%
may perhaps be less connected.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the process that you are
moving through over a long time

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
frame of time from
your perspective

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
is the integration
of those opposites.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor of
what we experience

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:84%
is the color white,
the all inclusive,

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
the holding all of it,
that the separate color

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:90%
rays have already reintegrated.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And this process is what
humanity is moving through

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
in somewhat individual
ways, because that is always

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:84%
the case, and in a
collective way as well.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going back
into the prism, in a way.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If you use the prison
analogy that everybody

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:84%
knows the Pink
Floyd album cover,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of where the light
comes through,

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and then it separates
into the rainbow.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:90%
We're sort of going back in.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And from that perspective
of the individuality,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
it is that reintegration
back into the oneness

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:90%
that occurs over time.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Because from your density,
it is the uniqueness.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It is the separation
that creates that deeper

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
understanding or that deeper
clarity of the reintegration.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But it is a long process
from your perspective.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
In the Lyran, I'm
sure time is measured

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
in a much different
manner, rotations

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of planets around
different celestial bodies.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to
compare in Earth years

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the time it took for the Lyrans
to go through this density

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:90%
shift?

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Billions of years?

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Billions.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Billions, yes.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.760 align:middle line:90%
The same time.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Billions of years, yes.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> From the perspective of pain,
that feels like a long time.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:90%
It's perspective of pain.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess it could be a lot
of births, a lot of deaths,

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:90%
a lot of wars and battles.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I guess life
itself is still--

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
the Lyran journey, is Earth
just an aspect of that?

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It is an aspect of that.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that
the Lyran journey

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:90%
occurs on many densities.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
are experiencing,

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
what humanity is experiencing,
is very much a Lyran journey.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It is not only a
Lyran journey, but it

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:90%
is part of the Lyran journey.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So there is an aspect
of the Lyran energy

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that is still at a
different density.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:37.480 align:middle line:84%
This is why we began earlier
by saying the density that you

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.110 align:middle line:84%
are speaking to now is not
the totality of the Lyran

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the seventh
density version,

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.720 align:middle line:90%
you know, this point in time.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're maybe a side
story or a chapter in that.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> An aspect within
the entire journey.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
A chapter within
the entire book.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And a subchapter
of the subchapter,

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.300 align:middle line:84%
if you look at all the other--
you know, we have the lineages,

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is in other
works we get into.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But the Syrian, there's all
these different star system,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians and
different chapters,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, that we can use
to reference our own chapter.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Like the line of a family.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.742 align:middle line:90%
A family line.

00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I guess this is how we say
we learn from our mistakes,

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:84%
but we also repeat
[LAUGHS] history a lot too.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:84%
How do we-- how do
we do it different?

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Or should we even try?

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it just going to
unfold in its own way?

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It is the whole
coin, yet the density

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that you are experiencing
is about the individual.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And we would say to you that
the key is to look within.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The key is to
change your journey.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And all else out there
ripens on its own.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:90%
You are 99% invisible.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:90%
You are 99% connected.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.235 align:middle line:90%
You are vast.

00:42:20.235 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It is for the individual
to find that power within.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Rather than controlling
the external,

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:34.910 align:middle line:84%
when you shift
the internal, that

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:39.570 align:middle line:84%
is what transforms the
entire thing much faster.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Much of your communication,
though it is not conscious,

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.830 align:middle line:84%
much of your
communication, 99% of it,

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.955 align:middle line:84%
is occurring on an
unconscious or a subtle level.

00:42:52.955 --> 00:42:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:84%
As you allow the
human self to tune

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.230 align:middle line:84%
more into the
greater self, you are

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
beginning to utilize that vast
engine that builds worlds.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it is helpful to observe
the things that are going on

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:84%
around you, and it is
most helpful to interact

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:90%
from this physicality.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Take the risks of interaction.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Whether they feel like
they're painful or scary,

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.180 align:middle line:90%
take the risks of interaction.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Because this entire life,
all of humanity, the rocks,

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:84%
the flowers, the animals,
Gaia, the Earth, the things

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have not
even named yet,

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
they want to receive
your energy, just

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:84%
as humanity wants
to receive love

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and connection from others,
though some may protest.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Take the risks of interaction.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Nurture the self within.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that is where the
keys of your evolution reside.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
All of this, this
physicality, often you

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.100 align:middle line:90%
take it much too seriously.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful
expression, and at times, it

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.260 align:middle line:90%
is a very painful expression.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you tune in to the self
and honor and love the self,

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:38.900 align:middle line:84%
you cannot help but observe
all of life through that lens.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you create
that wholeness within,

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:45.760 align:middle line:84%
you start to connect more with
the wholeness that you are,

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:90%
that 99% invisible.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the
information flow that

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is interacting even on the
physical level is much greater.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
People may not be
conscious of it,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.860 align:middle line:84%
but that is when the
impact, because you're

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:84%
using that vast engine,
becomes greater.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It is all the personal healing,
the personal empowerment,

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.200 align:middle line:84%
the strength within, to be
willing to love the self,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to love
when it's not easy,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that is the key to your change,
your evolution, your ascension.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.832 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural process.

00:45:22.832 --> 00:45:23.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:45:23.632 --> 00:45:27.930 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] So in
closing, how do we

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.873 align:middle line:10%
integrate those people who
still choose in separation?

00:45:32.873 --> 00:45:34.290 align:middle line:10%
We still have wars
on this planet.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.930 align:middle line:10%
We still have a lot of polarity.

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:38.670 align:middle line:10%
You said earlier do
the internal work.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.710 align:middle line:10%
So if we are internally
focusing on that,

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:10%
but yet we're faced in living
on-- on this one planet

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.500 align:middle line:10%
together with people
who still choose

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:10%
the path of polarization,
how does one walk that line?

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very important to get
your energy into this world.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why we speak
so much of empowerment.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when a being has the
strength of knowing the self so

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:15.420 align:middle line:84%
deeply that they
will take risks,

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.330 align:middle line:84%
not because of the
outcome, but because

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.310 align:middle line:84%
of the passionate flow,
when you follow those,

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.840 align:middle line:84%
you are flowing your
energy into this realm.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Interact with those
that may seem opposite,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:84%
or interact in the ways
that your passion flows.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Bring your energy to
the causes, the focuses,

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.900 align:middle line:84%
the artistic creations,
the businesses

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.690 align:middle line:90%
that you are passionate about.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:90%
That is what this world needs.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.790 align:middle line:10%
That's what helps
it move faster.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It needs the
individuals interacting.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Often, they are
the sensitive ones.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.530 align:middle line:90%
They are the compassionate ones.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
that when they know

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that wars are being
fought, not to protect,

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:15.960 align:middle line:84%
but to sustain greed or to
overtake and hold power,

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that it makes them
shrink back and contract

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:90%
from the pain of that.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Because they are sensitive.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.060 align:middle line:84%
They want that
compassion to flow.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They want others to be
enjoying and feel that safety

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:31.860 align:middle line:90%
and creativity as well.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:35.460 align:middle line:84%
That sensitivity is
a gift, and yet it

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:84%
can be a painful
burden at times.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But it is for the
compassionate ones

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen
enough that they can

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:49.290 align:middle line:84%
handle the flow of the emotions
and let that pain flow so

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that it can transform into the
strength that inspires them

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.310 align:middle line:90%
into new choice.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So whether it is
a prayer for one

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or a protest for another
or a vote for another

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:06.930 align:middle line:84%
or an action for
another of giving aid,

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:10.230 align:middle line:90%
get your energy into this world.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
When the compassionate
ones start leading,

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:90%
that is when the world changes.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself feel the
pain of that separation,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and then let yourself know
more deeply the determination

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:30.180 align:middle line:84%
of creating connection in the
ways that are passion flowing

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.860 align:middle line:90%
through you.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It is important, and it
comes in all kinds of ways.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But as you follow
those passions,

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:84%
you find that life starts
giving you the opportunities

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to be able to let
your passion flow

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and be supported in this realm.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It is not always easy.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It does not always come with
the immediate gratification.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But the sustaining of the
self when one is strong,

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:84%
they don't flow that passion
just for the outcome.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They flow it because
passion must flow.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That is how you deal with
observing the pain around you.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a reality, but
it's not the whole story.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It is just one
side of that coin.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of that coin

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is someone discovering within
their courage or their ability

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.950 align:middle line:90%
to sustain or help others.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It is what creates
more connection,

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because that polarization
seems stronger at first.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It is not easy to do,
but that is the work,

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and it is why each
being becoming stronger

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is a vital aspect
of your ascension.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It is not just blissful
thoughts and blissful feelings.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:03.730 align:middle line:84%
It is the willingness to
sustain that container of love,

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it seems
like a moment of joy,

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.780 align:middle line:84%
or it seems like a moment of
pain, the container of love

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.830 align:middle line:90%
is strong.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:10%
That positivity
and that neutrality

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:10%
continue to find
that balance, even

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:10%
though when that electron
first comes into the resonance,

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:28.930 align:middle line:10%
it begins to shift it, and
that feels uncomfortable.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But let that be the
sense of completion

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
that creates more
of a determination

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to hold the balance of
positivity and neutrality.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
When you see pain
also see the power

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that is within every being that
that being may not yet know.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they learn
it through someone else

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:59.390 align:middle line:84%

helping to pull them through.

And sometimes they learn it when
there is no hand to pull them,

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and they must find
that strength within.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to figure
out which one is correct.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
You just need to follow
your passionate flow.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.870 align:middle line:10%
Interact in ways that may seem
a little uncomfortable at first,

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:10%
but they feel like a compelling
that is drawing you forward

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.300 align:middle line:10%
into more completion.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:10%
This is a powerful
time for humanity.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It is an exciting
and a beautiful time.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And yet that polarization
that is created

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:10%
as that cellular division
happens for a new form to occur

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.070 align:middle line:10%
can either shut one
down permanently,

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:10%
or it can be the
moment in time that

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:10%
creates a blending of
the strength of the past

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.410 align:middle line:10%
and a connection of the
potentials of the future

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:10%
in your now, in your container.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:84%
There is great power within
you, within every being.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It is just blossoming forth
in a different season,

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.825 align:middle line:90%
a different moment for each.

saying, the sensitive ones,
even though these things happen,

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.910 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like it's still--

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.130 align:middle line:10%
we still need to come
out of our closets

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:40.830 align:middle line:10%
and interact, integrate, take
action, and like you said,

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:10%
be ourselves and
follow our passions.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:84%

Yes.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:05.570 align:middle line:84%
You begin to find there is less
separation, even in ideologies.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But you are not meant to
interact with every human.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You are not meant to
convince them of your way

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:90%
is the right way.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You are just meant
to flow your energy

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:21.440 align:middle line:84%
into your life, your
realm, your passions,

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.670 align:middle line:90%
and it begins to change.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But then you must look
for the clues of change.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the times where it
seems as if that is not enough,

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you must catalog that in
that beautiful, linear mind

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and retouch that
time, that potential,

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to help sustain that neutrality
and that positivity within you,

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:55.250 align:middle line:84%
honoring this container, this
sacred vessel that you are,

00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:00.170 align:middle line:84%
sometimes means reaching out
and receiving and connecting.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes honoring
this sacred vessel

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.800 align:middle line:84%
means saying no or
holding a boundary

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:90%
or choosing not to interact.

speak to you of the
precious moments

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:84%

new potentials for humanity.

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the peace
within that creates

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the peace in the external realm,
but do not expect every moment

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.620 align:middle line:90%
to be peaceful.

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And do not blame the
self when you are not

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:90%
having that peaceful moment.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Nurture the self.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Nurture, just as
you would a child

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that you are strengthening
for the future.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%

sustain that container of love,

tears, or it is a moment of joy.

It may take time to
manifest, but life

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:46.750 align:middle line:90%
is failsafed towards love.

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Love is that connective energy.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Life is connected.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.570 align:middle line:10%
Life returns to love.

from our expression.

We say [NON-ENGLISH],, which
helps to understand some

of that connection.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it is easy from
a linear perspective

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to assume that something
is better or worse.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:10%
And part of what is written into
the information of that phrase

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:30.970 align:middle line:10%
is that you are so valuable
and cherished by all of life.

It is like just listening.

I'll actually pull
the channel off.
