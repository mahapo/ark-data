[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.946 --> 00:00:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Our human body, our
individual state of being,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is a mere representation
of the entire universe.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Every atom we have is
a mirror reflection

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:90%
of the atoms in the universe.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
And as the universe shifts,
and moves, and changes,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
we are simultaneously shifting.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.202 align:middle line:90%
I am one.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is one.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:90%
The universe is one.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:10%
The oneness of the universe to
the oneness of the individual--

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:10%
there's absolutely no difference
whatsoever, other than the fact

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:10%
that our every moment
is a representation

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:10%
of the one slide in the
PowerPoint presentation

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:10%
or the one image per slot.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.975 align:middle line:84%
Because our brains are not
advanced enough, complex enough

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
to process simultaneous
experiences at once,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
we have a limited
experience here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
on this planet with
one slide at a time.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we can get
caught up in each slide

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and not realizing that that
slide is a representation

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:90%
of the last slide.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.739 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a full
flow, not a touching yourself

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:84%
to every moment so
that you can easily

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.995 align:middle line:84%
move into the next
slide, and understanding

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that the current slide
is just a state of being,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
an impermanent state of being,
a whimsical state of being--

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.792 align:middle line:90%
whimsical non-attachment.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're back.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're back.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we are going to
have a little conversation with

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Khan.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.723 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe you
could introduce Khan,

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
cause we didn't really talk
about him at all prior.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So he's definitely not
as prominent as Herra.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
He came through back in 2015.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Khan is a Mantis being.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
He's from the 12th dimension.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I first got
in contact with him,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I had just undergone
foot surgery.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was hanging out
at my dad's house.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
He was taking care of me
after the foot surgery.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was just the fact that I

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
was in a state of
meditation, or if I just

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working at the time
and I was really relaxed,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But in an instant,
all of a sudden,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
this giant Mantis being
comes into the room.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:90%
I close my eyes.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I see him there.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And he was huge.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I see him
out in the universe,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
he looks like he's 40 feet tall.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But he squishes himself into
buildings when he comes in.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So because he's in
the 12th dimension,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:90%
he's completely non-physical.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't have a body.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
He is in the astral
plane all of the time.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we had a lovely
conversation back in 2015

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
when he first introduced me.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I had this huge download--

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
unlocked a massive
amount of DNA within me--

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
when he came through.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I spent four hours
documenting the conversation,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, our
conversation together.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And part of the conversation
was I asked him who he was.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I am you.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, OK, great.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You're another
parallel self of mine.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
That's really awesome.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:90%
So when am I you?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:90%
When was this?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.685 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it was about
200 lifetimes in the future,

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty cool.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.577 align:middle line:90%
That's not too far away.

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not far at all--

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the scope of--

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In the grand
scheme of things.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:90%
So very exciting.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then,
I've spoken to him,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and brought him through, and
consulted him on some things.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But he's very
different than Heera.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Heera is very expansive,
very conversational.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Heera really loves to explain
things and go into visuals.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Khan is very right to the point,
very efficient and effective.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he will
do these one-liners

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and then leave it at that.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And when he comes
to you in visions,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
even though you say he's
non-physical, he has a--

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:84%
How does it work when you
say he's a Mantis being,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.502 align:middle line:84%
and you see him, but
yet he's non-physical?

00:04:57.502 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's something
we could ask Khan later.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> How does that work?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.412 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you think that works?

00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So for a lot of species, from
the 8th dimension to the 12th

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
dimension, there's a choice in
whether or not they want to be

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body
or a non-physical body.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're still
incarnated, in a sense.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
They're still separate.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They're still acting as a
separate entity from source.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
necessarily confined

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
to that physical limitation.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I've even seen
a lot of Pleiadians

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
who are non-physical.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So they're in their
astral body all the time.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so like I said, Khan--

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:90%
he's got this beautiful--

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Not a cape, but like--

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] what is it?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
A robe-- yeah, he's got
a beautiful robe on.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And I literally
look at the robe,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
and it looks like the galaxy.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one color.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just this moving energy.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this darker
skin, but it's also--

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:90%
it changes as well.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
His skin changes quite often.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
I usually see him

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
universe, just sitting,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:90%
really observing things.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
does most of the time--

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is just observe the
flow of the universe.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And he usually exists
solo, most of the time.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so he's a
very different energy.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And he's more universal--

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
a universal truth, rather
than quantum physics,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
genetics, and
hybridization, as Heera is.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, can we bring
him through and start

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
having some words and
dialogue with Khan?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So Khan-- wondering what your
role is in this ascension

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
process that we're going
through right now on the planet.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.384 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.384 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> [SIGHS] Hmm.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.305 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:58.305 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So he's showing me the
image of the planet.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing me himself
incarnating into this planet.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me
some words as well.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was showing
me that he incarnates

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:90%
into individual creatures--

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of animals,
even plants--

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
to teach lessons through
those individual incarnations.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
He also says that he can and
does come through other people

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Other people channel him.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't incarnate as one
person in particular as Khan.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:90%
But he allows other people.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, he's acting as
his oversoul for planet Earth.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
He does a lot of work out
there in the universe.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.063 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, for this
planet in particular, he does--

00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get the
words again from him.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that he
individually incarnates to teach

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:90%
a collective, conscious lesson.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he does--

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, anyway.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, he's kind
of a collective consciousness

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:35.519 align:middle line:84%
himself, incarnating,
individualizing

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:39.040 align:middle line:84%
as an individual
consciousness to teach--

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Humanity.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>> --the rest of the collective,
the human collective,

00:08:42.262 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
be a collective.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sweet.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:90%
So he'll give lessons.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of curious now.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I kind of want to ask
him what an example would be

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So yes, Khan, if
you could give us

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
an example of how you
teach these lessons

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.762 align:middle line:90%
to the collective.

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he said that
this just happened.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
One of his incarnations
passed away.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:90%
But this happens all the time.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Because he incarnates
so frequently

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
in a variety of different
bodies on this planet,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:90%
the lifespan is very short.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:90%
He incarnated as a little boy.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not totally
sure where it

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
was, because it looked like
the Middle East somewhere.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of commotion--

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I just get this image
of people everywhere.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a marketplace,
but it was somewhere

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in the city-- lots of
cars, lots of commotion.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was this little
boy with dark skin.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up getting
hit by a driver.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if the
driver was drinking,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:84%
or if he was just on
some sort of rampage.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But the driver shouldn't
have been there.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And so this little boy gets hit.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And Khan says that that
little boy was him.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The boy was about
five or six years old.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked Khan--

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, so what does that mean?

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Did you incarnate
for that entire time?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I came through as
that little boy

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
just to shed light so that this
man who was driving this car

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
could learn this lesson
that he has yet to learn.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that man was
very angry, very abusive,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:90%
very--

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
not a very pleasant
energy to many people.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.252 align:middle line:84%
And that man had
to learn a lesson.

00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that came
through that little boy.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful thing is that,
because Khan sacrifices himself

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
so many times, there's
no attachment there.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to think about
an individual or a soul living

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:90%
just to teach--

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and then, really, just to die--

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
without having to go through
the same sort of lessons

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that we typically need to go
through as incarnated beings.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's probably
the 12th dimensional oversoul

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:84%
aspect of that-- that
he doesn't necessarily

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:84%
need to learn any of
those lessons himself.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
He is just at of
position now where

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
he is giving all
of those lessons

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:90%
through those incarnated beings.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that sense,
then, the boy himself--

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --would he be
fully actualized?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Or is he just playing
the role of a boy?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I asked him
the same thing, too.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like, OK,
how were you as a boy?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you [LAUGHS] weird?

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, no, he was
just playing the role of a boy.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was very,
very light-hearted,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:90%
would always smile at people.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Whatever he could do
to help his family--

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
cooking, or baking,
or what have you--

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
he was always right
there in that position.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And so he was just a
very light-hearted boy.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And his contracts were of
those five or six years,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to teach those lessons, and
to shed light on the community

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.418 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
parents of the boy?

00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They must have been devastated.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Let me check in with him.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.808 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what he has to say.

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, beautiful.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Wow, this is so interesting.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] It makes so much sense.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Right away, of course, the
parents were devastated.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
There was other children.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But they were very
just devastated,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
because that was
probably the brightest

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:90%
light within the family.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And Khan explained
it in an instant.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
He said that the
parents were concluding,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
within their own soul, some
past-life karmic energy where

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:90%
they also had a child pass away.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And those parents--
individually,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in individual lives--

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
ended up taking their own
life when their son ended up

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:90%
passing away.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they couldn't
live any-- they

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to live
anymore when that happened.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:84%
In this incarnation,
in this lifetime,

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
those parents needed to go
through the same experience

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and find their own strength
through that to complete

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:90%
the karmic energies.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And Khan said, if
there was another child

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
or another little boy who
passed away in Khan's place,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
there would have been more
karma created than completed.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've had some interactions
with various Mantis beings

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And the information that's
come through them to me

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.843 align:middle line:90%
was that they are--

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
especially the
higher-dimensional ones, but it

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:84%
sounds like Khan is up
there in dimensions.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> They're the archetypes of--

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
The architects--
not the archetypes,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.385 align:middle line:84%
but the architects of
this current matrix

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.723 align:middle line:90%
we're residing in.

00:13:45.723 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Does he have anything
to say about that?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good question.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.834 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:52.318 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:52.318 --> 00:13:52.802 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:52.802 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.361 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.915 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:02.316 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:02.316 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.383 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
different roles.

00:14:05.383 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And being the architects
makes a lot of sense,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:90%
especially with the Mantis.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
He says specifically
that that's not his role.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> He calls himself the
overseer of the universe.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So he will, simultaneously,
be tapped into a variety

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of different dimensions, in a
variety of different incarnated

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
beings, but also overseeing
those different dimensions

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and different civilizations to
make sure that everything is

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
going in flow, everything
is going as planned.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So he calls himself
the overseer.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he said something else
about just this planet as well.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
so yeah, so Khan says that he's
not a creator in that sense.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though he creates
himself into individual

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
incarnations, he only
oversees the creation.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.757 align:middle line:84%
He does not create the
creation, if that makes sense.

00:14:59.757 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes total sense.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So another
analogy that I use--

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:90%
maybe he can verify.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
And we're going specifics here.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is part of
the show-- is defining,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
what are these beings?

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
The facilitators of desire--

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
so if one person is giving
off a specific frequency,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.000 align:middle line:84%
or has a desire to do something
on one side of the planet,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
another person has
another desire,

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and they're a vibrational match.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So I've always saw
the Mantis beings

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
as orchestrating certain
events and things

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
to happen in a specific way--
like, OK, the train is delayed

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
by 15 minutes.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So then this person gets on
the right step, and this thing,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:90%
and this thing.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.373 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
those two people

00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
can meet and facilitate
each other's desires,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much
distance, how much time,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:90%
or how much-- whatever it is.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that the Mantis being's role?

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
From my own perspective
working with Khan,

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
you pinpointed it better than I
probably could ever articulate.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what Khan
has to say about that.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
That's really cool.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's see.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.472 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, Khan
really doesn't have

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.625 align:middle line:84%
much to say about that,
because he's saying, yes--

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:20.425 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --a big yes.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.505 align:middle line:84%
And then he called
you something,

00:16:23.505 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
He explained it, too.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.788 align:middle line:84%
He said that you're
a brother in arms.

00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
That you're a brother in arms--
that's what he's calling you.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm getting goosebumps.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:32.435 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:16:32.435 --> 00:16:33.808 align:middle line:90%
>> And so I said, OK, cool.

00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the brother
thing-- you clearly have some

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Mantis to you as well.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And you understand
at that level.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But I said, brother in
arms, what does that mean?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Arms-- weird.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
He's ready to fight?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And Khan said, yeah,
he's here to perpetuate

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
the mission of not just the
collective consciousness, which

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:84%
you are, but also that Mantis,
the overseer, the alignment.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.385 align:middle line:84%
You plant the seeds, but
you don't necessarily push.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Brother Khan.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:04.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:04.755 --> 00:17:05.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:17:05.685 --> 00:17:08.656 align:middle line:84%
>> That actually has a nice
ring to it-- brother Khan.

00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:09.456 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:17:09.456 --> 00:17:09.888 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:10.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Khan!

00:17:10.752 --> 00:17:11.919 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a different Khan.

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.562 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that said,
I've had these--

00:17:17.562 --> 00:17:19.229 align:middle line:84%
personally, I've had
a few interactions.

00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have names or--

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
they've come in a few
times through clicking.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
this clicking idea.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
With me and my
expansive research

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
into all of these
different beings--

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians, we went
into earlier, Zetas--

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the only real conscious
memories I have of interactions

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:90%
is actually with Mantis beings.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he have anything
to say with that?

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's see.

00:17:50.366 --> 00:17:54.358 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.358 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
He said that your
interactions with Mantis

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest way for you
to wake up and understand

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
what you're here to do.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And he compared it
to an interaction

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiadians.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So in comparison with the
interaction with Pleiadians,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:84%
you could receive a lot of
knowledge and information.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about-- there's two things.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
One, the Pleiadian vibration--
very similar to humans.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
indistinguishable, in a sense.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the other part
is the Pleiadian energy

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and information is
very divinely feminine.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's not clear-cut.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
The information interaction
and the awareness,

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the awakening, the
transition, the transmutation

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
that could happen
and does happen

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
when you remember your
Mantis lineage is--

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:90%
it's a shock to the system.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pleiadians is a really
lovely, fluffy integration.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
The Mantis is like, boom.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> They're very--

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's a little bit more--

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
you've had many experiences
with Pleiadian energy.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You're just not aware of it,
because it's indistinguishable.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes sense.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.682 align:middle line:84%
During those
interactions, I've gotten

00:19:12.682 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
some of these downloads
and other things.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had physical
sensations of the clicking--

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --whether it starts with
fingers tapping, like this,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
actual physical jaws
clicking, like this.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And we talked
about that at lunch.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So could Khan just go
into that a little bit--

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's see.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --and describe what
is happening there?

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.174 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:42.174 --> 00:19:42.974 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:47.783 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.783 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK, two things--

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:84%
one that came through right
away was the DNA activation.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:84%
There was this aspect
of your Mantoid,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Mantis DNA being activated.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
to that was you

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
said involuntary responses
or involuntary interaction

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.460 align:middle line:90%
with them, right?

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So involuntary in the
sense that you weren't

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
necessarily planning on--

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --communicating or
interacting with them.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But because they were
in your vibration,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:84%
your body instantly--
your soul instantly--

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
took on the shape, and the
form, and the interaction

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of those Mantoids, which
is involuntary interaction.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
what it felt like.

00:20:30.557 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I was involuntary convulsing.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I liken it to a
fish out of water.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.503 align:middle line:84%
I was literally
flopping in my bed

00:20:41.503 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
when it got really
intense, when I was getting

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
full downloads of what you
were talking about before,

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:90%
the zip files.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I got some.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I had some questions.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
started doing the show,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and going into history of Earth,
and these kinds of things.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally
energetically just shaking

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:90%
and on my bed like, [GIBBERISH].

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what is happening?

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, and go with it, and just let
it flow and get the downloads.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I unpacked those.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's just been validating.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's cool.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> --another validation.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.512 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Some other archetypal
energies with the Mantis

00:21:23.975 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and downloads that I've
received is the idea of insects.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And the evolution of the
insects in maybe other worlds

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
seems to be quite fast,
because of the collective hive

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:90%
mentality, perhaps.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Does he have anything to
add onto that or go into?

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Hive mentality, evolution.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.755 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, great question.

00:21:53.755 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.508 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I've
never really thought

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
about the hive mentality
and then evolu-- never

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:90%
really even thought about that.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:90%
But 100%, he's saying that--

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
the word that he
used was cohesive.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:84%
There's this
cohesion, cohesiveness

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that happens when
you've got, basically,

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
one soul ruling over
many different bodies.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
get something done,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you're all cooperating
together to do it.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is really fast
evolution in that sense.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether that be building
incredibly large structures,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
or evolving scientifically,
spiritually,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:90%
there's that cohesion.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, it takes a master
soul to work with another master

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
soul in tandem, in harmony, in
order to get something done,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
as older the soul you
get, as more experience

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.445 align:middle line:84%
you have under your
belt, the more difficult

00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
it can be, because
you're working

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
with other very unique souls
who all have their own agenda.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's more difficult,
but there's also

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot more lessons to learn.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
When you have that other
soul to have that mirror

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:84%
reflection to say, oh,
why did I attract you,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
there's none of that when
it's the hive mentality.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
When there's just
one soul, there's

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of advancements
in a lot of ways,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and also a lack of
challenge in a lot

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
of ways, which also
lacks some or holds back

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
some sort of
advancement as well.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's pros and cons.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
You have to look at it.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But he was mentioning
and referencing

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
all the human beings on this
planet and the mastery level

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have to get to to
even just exist on this planet

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:84%
with other human beings who all
have their own indoctrinated

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
belief systems, projections,
and attachments.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, especially when it
comes to different cultures,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and different religious
groups, and in countries.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And now we're getting more and
more unified with the internet.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But there still
are some countries

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.053 align:middle line:84%
that are a little bit
slower to take on new ideas.

00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, once
they take them on--

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've made this comparison
with Japanese culture

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:90%
or Asian culture.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They tend to-- and
this is not an insult,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
but this is just a
realization that they

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
tend to be a little
more hive mentality.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And to get through on some
issues, it takes a long time.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But once you get through,
it spreads like wildfire.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I use the
internet as an example.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Japan was one of
the last countries

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to really have a really good
internet infrastructure.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But once they got it, it's the
best internet on the planet.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And everybody wants it.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.052 align:middle line:84%
Silicon Valley is
trying to get to--

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
everybody is trying to
migrate to Japan because

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of their infrastructure.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And the speed is so fast.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So that, I guess,
just reflecting

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:90%
on what you just said there.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Was there a centralized
place in the galaxy

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
universe that the
Mantis being came from?

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Where in the galaxy
did they come from?

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's take a look.

00:25:15.362 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] Mm-hmm.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:90%
That is so interesting.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to say
exactly what planet it is.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely
nowhere close to here.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not a planet
that I recognize.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:84%
He did give me a name
for it, and not sure

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:90%
if it's known out there.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely somewhere
else in the universe.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And he called it planet Kai--

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.838 align:middle line:90%
K-A-I, planet Kai.

00:25:41.838 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Probably just the translation
into our language, right?

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's cool.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
He showed me the whole evolution
of the Mantoids, which I've

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:90%
never personally seen before.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.203 align:middle line:84%
They started off looking
very much like the insects.

00:25:56.203 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The praying mantis.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But not as small--
definitely not as small.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the evolution,
the separation,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of the different groups
all across the planet--

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
the different advancements
that they made,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.867 align:middle line:84%
the telepathy that
they had, the language

00:26:10.867 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that they developed, and then
the fact that they started

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
getting off of the planet.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're at an
extremely ancient species.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They've been around for
a very, very long time.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And they've had
millennia upon millennia

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:90%
to advance themselves.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they've
really had a hand--

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
or a claw-- involved in the
advancement, the structure,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of many
different species

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:90%
all across the universe.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Once again, they're
very non-intervention.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
But they love being--

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I call them the masters
of the universe.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:90%
They really oversee things.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The architects-- they
really structure things

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
without that direct involvement,
which is so beautiful.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then Khan was
also comparing--

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because I was like, ooh,
this is kind of weird

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:90%
watching all the Mantoids.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had
different colors, too.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I saw some white
Mantoids as well

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
in there, and some orange
ones, and whatever.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they all
grew, and developed,

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.352 align:middle line:84%
and went off the planet,
and went everywhere.

00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, ooh,
this is kind of weird.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well,
Elizabeth, it's

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
not as weird as you may think it
is, because think about the way

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that human beings--
or, really, any species

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:90%
around the universe-- existed.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Same thing-- from a lower
life form into a much more

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.250 align:middle line:90%
intelligent form.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we were just
animals not too long ago.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, I guess we're
still mammals, but--

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But we've had
our genetic pushes.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've had
our genetic pushes.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In their evolution, did they
have any genetic pushes from

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:90%
any other--

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] Hmm.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
There was one point in time when
there was another very advanced

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
species or civilization-- and I
believe it was the or Anunnaki

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
or a subspecies of the
Anunnaki-- who came in.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki spoke to
the leaders of the Mantis.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we can give
you that push, whether it

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
be a technology transfer,
or a genetic involvement,

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But the Mantis had
to give up something.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:90%
But it was this give and take.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the Mantoids
said, absolutely not.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.677 align:middle line:90%
We want to keep our sovereignty.

00:28:33.677 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was the word that came
through-- was the sovereignty.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So they actually decided
to go solo and advance

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
themselves to do it exactly the
way that they wanted to do it.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there was
probably other subsections

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or other subspecies of Mantoids
who probably did get help.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But specifically, maybe
where Khan came from,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:84%
or that lineage, or the
main dominant lineage said,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:90%
absolutely not.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
We will keep our
full sovereignty

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and our full
freewill and control.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Super cool.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, in abduction or
temporary detainment scenarios,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:90%
people have--

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
with, typically, the
Greys, and the short ones

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:90%
doing all the work.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes-- as
we talked to Heera,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
he said, there's a taller
one in the corner somewhere,

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:90%
a white one or something.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, in the
mix of the little guys,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:90%
there's a Mantoid in the corner.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What is their role in
the hybridization program?

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, great question.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.816 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So the Mantoids
that typically work

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys and the
Galactic Federation

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:90%
are lower-dimensional Mantoids.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're usually anywhere
between probably 8th dimension

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:90%
and 10th dimension.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.565 align:middle line:90%
And they're in physical bodies.

00:30:02.565 --> 00:30:04.148 align:middle line:84%
So actually, they're
physically there.

00:30:04.148 --> 00:30:05.732 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to make
that distinction.

00:30:05.732 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said--
it was really cool.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
They are there to
specifically oversee

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
any potential for infringement.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the word that he
used-- was infringement.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.853 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
kind of infringement?

00:30:20.853 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.962 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- not
necessarily with a mistake.

00:30:25.962 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It could be a conscious
decision as well.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But in one of those
decisions, they

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:84%
could make a species that
could destroy the universe.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They could make
a master species.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
They could-- so especially when
we're dealing with genetics,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and hybridization,
and a lot of power,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
they have to be there
to oversee things.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they, the
Mantoids, go up

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
to the higher Mantoids
and relay information.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- I don't want
to say they're kind of like

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:90%
the police.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But they do oversee.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And they just make sure that
there is no universal law

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
infringement.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Because a lot of people
associate them as the master

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:90%
geneticist.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But we heard from Heera
before that they're called upon

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.065 align:middle line:84%
by other species
to be the genetic--

00:31:14.065 --> 00:31:16.985 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
again, not using the
word manipulation,

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.145 align:middle line:84%
but the genetic
pushers, genetic--

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, advancement.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --advancers.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So do they actually--
the lower Mantoids,

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
the physicalized ones-- do
they actually do genetic work?

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Or are they just policing?

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's take a look.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.695 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:31:33.695 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of knowledge.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of their knowledge--

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
it's on all topics
within the universe.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And definitely part
of their knowledge

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is within genetics,
and the hybridization,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and how to do things
a certain way.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:84%
He still gave me this
image of this Mantis--

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:84%
not him, but another one--
working on-board a ship,

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:90%
physically, with Greys.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And if the Greys
were to be stumped,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or they can't really
figure out that harmony,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
the Mantoid will give the Grey
a download of information on how

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.965 align:middle line:84%
to do it the way that
they want to do it.

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So once, again it
feels like they

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of knowledge
in that regard.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
very non-intervention,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:90%
non-interfere.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They're there to oversee
things, but not necessarily--

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.645 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't really feel
like their project at all.

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:90%
The Mantis and the hybrids--

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.140 align:middle line:84%
it really doesn't feel
like it's their thing.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
They're really just
on the outskirts,

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.397 align:middle line:90%
even the ones who are physical.

00:32:35.397 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> They're just helping
to facilitate the desire--

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Facilitate, yeah.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.187 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:40.187 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --for the Zetas
and for the humans.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And facilitate--
that's probably the best--

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:46.795 align:middle line:90%
>> They're facilitators.

00:32:46.795 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Facilitators of desire.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have physicalized
little Mantis beings

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
on our planet here.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Can we use that--

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.990 align:middle line:84%
or I've heard actually
already that we

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.900 align:middle line:84%
can use that as a permission
slip to tap into that energy.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.812 align:middle line:90%
Are they related?

00:33:08.812 --> 00:33:10.270 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Are they
actually related?

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:14.252 align:middle line:84%
Or what's the deal
with our connection

00:33:14.252 --> 00:33:15.460 align:middle line:90%
with our little mantis folks?

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's great.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
words here, but I'm

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
going to try and say
it the best I can.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.592 align:middle line:90%
This is what he's saying.

00:33:24.592 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
They're helping to anchor in the
advancement of the population

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.877 align:middle line:84%
by bringing forward the
vibration of the Mantis.

00:33:38.877 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.810 align:middle line:90%
So he showed me the image.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like all of
these little praying mantis

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.250 align:middle line:84%
bugs that we have
here-- insects, really.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I think bugs is probably
not a great word.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Nah, that's fine.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're actually holding
part of this praying mantis DNA

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They're not really making a
huge impact on the planet.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But our awareness of them
is allowing us to openly,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:10.739 align:middle line:84%
consciously bring in the
vibration of the Mantoids.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are anchoring
in that vibration

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:90%
just by being on this planet.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And Khan also brought
up a couple of the--

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:90%
what is it called?

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Martial art--
yeah, a couple of--

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There's praying
mantis style--

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:90%
>> --Kung Fu.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:32.806 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:33.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.227 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a very unique style.

00:34:35.227 --> 00:34:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of the movements
we're also mirrored after some

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.659 align:middle line:84%
of the movements of
the praying mantis.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And the people, the individuals,
who brought in the praying

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
mantis Kung Fu and some
of the more Krav Maga--

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.739 align:middle line:90%
or not Krav Maga, Capoeira--

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that flow and that
movement, they're

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
actually connected to the
Mantis beings as well.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
knowledge that's being

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
taken from the praying mantis
beings, the praying mantis

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:84%
insects, and imparted
onto the planet.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And I always find, when
Khan comes through,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I always find a praying mantis
somewhere, which is really--

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hi, Khan.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I mean,
just like, hello.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] He's so cute.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe not so cute
is the fact that the female

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.653 align:middle line:84%
praying mantis bites the
head off of the male--

00:35:24.653 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it can
be quite violent.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --after it mates, right?

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So [LAUGHS] do they do that?

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.135 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming they
don't in higher dimensions.

00:35:33.135 --> 00:35:34.093 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure they don't.

00:35:34.093 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But how does that translate
into these higher-dimensional

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:90%
realities?

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.452 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's take a look.

00:35:38.452 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.872 align:middle line:84%
So some of that violence,
in a sense, comes through.

00:35:45.872 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept saying
this was, over and over

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:90%
again, life and death--

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
this understanding of
the rebirth, the death.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to--
he was even giving

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
the example of lions
and other large cats

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:84%
who end up, basically, killing
all of their young right

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:90%
after they're born.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
pattern, there's

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.650 align:middle line:90%
this cycle of life and death.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And he was also talking
about the strength

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
of the divine feminine as
well, which is interesting.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But he said, no, we
don't do any of that.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We're much more
advanced than that.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Even the physical ones that are
these giant, physical Mantis

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:90%
beings--

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.808 align:middle line:84%
they don't even bother
with that, either.

00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be a very--

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine a giant
praying mantis biting heads off

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:90%
of their mates.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Let's not.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That could get violent.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's not do that.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's-- no.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably in some
horror movie somewhere--

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --it's already been done.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So would the Mantis
more be aligned

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:90%
with the feminine energy?

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.403 align:middle line:90%
Or is it quite balanced?

00:36:46.403 --> 00:36:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work?

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let me ask.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, overall,
it's very balanced

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:90%
between masculine and feminine.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it's not
necessarily the physical parts

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:90%
that make it male or female.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the vibration and energy.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So they still have the
distinction within the binary

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
between, oh, you've got
a more feminine essence,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:90%
or a more masculine essence.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's no ranking system
based on gender, or vibration,

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty straight
across the board.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And have the Mantis beings--

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:84%
at this high level of
evolution that they've

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
achieved in our
dimensional matrix reality,

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:84%
have they expanded beyond this
dimension in this reality?

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.538 align:middle line:84%
And are they interwoven
into other matrices?

00:37:41.538 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's take a look.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying that,
after the 12th dimension,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:90%
you go back to source.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to
go back to source.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you can choose to
create your own universe.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, there's
been many a Mantis

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:84%
who have gone on to create their
own matrix reality within that.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And he said, absolutely.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot
have chosen to do.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of curious
what he wants to do.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I ask?

00:38:14.477 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Has he done that?

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.352 align:middle line:90%
Or will he be doing that soon?

00:38:17.352 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, he's in
the 12th dimension.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> He's kind of at the end
of this dimensional matrix

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so curious if
he's thought about that

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:84%
or where he wants to
go after he graduates.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So he says that he really
enjoys this universe.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
He really enjoys this
matrix, in a sense.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.540 align:middle line:90%
So he's going to stick around.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Especially when a
being is incarnated

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:84%
without a body, like I said,
between 8 to 12 dimensions,

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
you can choose whether
you want a body or not.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
don't have a body,

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
you can choose when
your exit point is.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So he says, oh, I'll
be here for a while.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And when he says, a while,
he means a long time.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:90%
[BIRD CHIRPING]

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Confirmation.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So he said, eventually, when
he's done with being there

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and overseeing the
universe in that way,

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
he will choose to move on
and create his own universe.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said that that's
usually what most beings choose

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because, if you just
go back to source

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:84%
after that 12
dimensions, there's

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
really not a whole lot else
to see or do in this universe.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You've kind of done it all.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.017 align:middle line:84%
So typically, you go on, and
you create your own universe.

00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:36.683 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
infinite amount of--

00:39:36.683 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a whole
new set of rules.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Since this is a binary
system, then there

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.180 align:middle line:84%
would be whatever
your imagination can--

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Many other infinite
numbers of systems.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And the one time I decided to
astral travel to check out,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:90%
hey, is there another universe?

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:84%
That was just a question
that I had back in the day.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went into--
and it was so cool.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.163 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how
I ended up doing this.

00:40:00.163 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it was a hologram,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.038 align:middle line:84%
or if I just astral
traveled there.

00:40:03.038 --> 00:40:07.085 align:middle line:90%
[BIRD CHIRPING]

00:40:07.085 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:90%
But I went out of this universe.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And I took a look at all
of the other universes.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And it literally looked like
this giant, almost donut shape,

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and all of these bright lights.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, I was quite far back.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And every light that I saw, they
told me, was its own universe.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.465 align:middle line:84%
If you think about looking
at a torus from the top down,

00:40:33.465 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:90%
it would look like a donut.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that that's
basically the shape--

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.350 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the
energy-- that I was seeing.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always, in
meditation, have asked,

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:84%
what does the universe
look like if it had shape?

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And I always come back to--

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.003 align:middle line:90%
I try to go into other shapes.

00:40:49.003 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And always come
back to the torus.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Torus-- I know.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:90%
That is--

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe similar to this
Alex Grey picture you showed us

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.070 align:middle line:90%
something like that, right?

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:59.493 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Which we saw a little
mantis face in there today.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.230 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've had several
experiences with the plant

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300 align:middle line:90%
medicine ayahuasca.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've had, I feel, a couple
of times-- one, for sure--

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
a very prominent time
when several Mantises

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
came into the room and
started doing some work.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got more
downloads on who they were.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:84%
What's the relationship
with that medicine?

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And is there any other medicine
that they're connected with?

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.823 align:middle line:90%
Or what--

00:41:37.823 --> 00:41:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great question.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:46.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK, this is so cool.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
He said that-- and
it was very clear.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for those who
are seeking, we are waiting.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when you ask
about any other medicine,

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:84%
any time you release DMT
or dimethyltryptamine

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in the pineal gland,
and you're seeking,

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be there.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Because many people have also
made claims that they've seen

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Mantis beings under
the influence of--

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.455 align:middle line:84%
or in ceremony with--
ayahuasca or DMT.

00:42:14.455 --> 00:42:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't be surprised.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:90%
But not everyone would--

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Not everyone.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --because not everyone is
ready to seek the knowledge

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're asking for.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> They're asking
for what they want,

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're not necessarily
ready to receive.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So at that-- particularly the
one ceremony that just called

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.640 align:middle line:84%
them in, so to say, another
friend of mine had received

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the night before in ceremony
specific symbols that he then

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:84%
was instructed to play
the symbols on a gong,

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.663 align:middle line:90%
to use a mallet, or--

00:42:50.663 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I forget what you use.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And he literally drew
them out on the gong.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And it made this super
crazy, weird sound.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, right when he
started doing that, I was like,

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:90%
oh, the Mantis are here.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.690 align:middle line:84%
That's where-- I don't
know if I was specifically

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:90%
looking for the Mantis.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.368 align:middle line:84%
But we were both-- we had
a separate talk outside

00:43:09.368 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of the group.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were like, let's
call them in tonight.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He's like, I
know the secrets.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was a pretty
intense ceremony.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
lot of information

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:90%
from them at that time.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But is there a specific
language that they use--

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:90%
symbols, or light language?

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have-- the
more physicalized ones.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Khan probably is beyond
language at this point.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.415 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's take a look.

00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:40.215 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:40.674 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:43:40.674 --> 00:43:41.474 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:43:41.474 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:43.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So there is a language
that they use.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.172 align:middle line:84%
And it's cool, because
we've kind of been hearing

00:43:47.172 --> 00:43:48.765 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of it from the--

00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:49.625 align:middle line:90%
>> The woodpeckers.

00:43:49.625 --> 00:43:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --the woodpeckers.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:90%
It's this clicking.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a clicking
language that they

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:84%
use, sounding very similar
to these woodpeckers,

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:84%
but obviously-- and it almost
sounds almost like Morse code

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.557 align:middle line:90%
with the clicking.

00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, apart from
that, I asked him

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.112 align:middle line:84%
if they use light language at
all, because most species--

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.820 align:middle line:84%
yeah, out there in
the universe, they all

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
use light language
or a dialect of it.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:84%
He said there's something
about their mouth

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.920 align:middle line:84%
that they can't necessarily
maybe form the--

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The sounds.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --the sounds.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why they
just revert to the clicking.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the clickings happen
through physical bodies?

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.285 align:middle line:84%
Or does it actually
happen with their mouths?

00:44:28.285 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Every Mantis in particular
has its own style of doing it.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Some of them do use their body--

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:90%
different body parts, even.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
do use their mouth.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And they make different
sounds with it.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would have no idea
how to even begin to--

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --start that.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.000 align:middle line:90%
But most of them are telepathic.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.375 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of them
are telepathic,

00:44:58.375 --> 00:45:00.452 align:middle line:84%
whether they be physical
or non-physical.

00:45:00.452 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
light language.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And they can communicate
mostly telepathically.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So even the little
guys on our planet--

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
can we telepathically
communicate with them?

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:16.616 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Ah, interesting.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:18.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times, those
little praying mantis

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.105 align:middle line:84%
have an oversoul that is
connected to a mantis.

00:45:27.105 --> 00:45:29.522 align:middle line:84%
So usually, they're just doing
their little praying mantis

00:45:29.522 --> 00:45:30.322 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're just living
life as a praying mantis.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you connect
with it consciously,

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and you call it in,
you will end up--

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.908 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
picking up a phone

00:45:39.908 --> 00:45:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and calling one of
the Mantis beings.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:41.925 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the big guys.

00:45:41.925 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, oh, oh, someone's
calling me from Earth.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.293 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what's going on?

00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they will connect
with you telepathically,

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.300 align:middle line:90%
which is really cool.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I never knew that.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.952 align:middle line:84%
>> We can use a little
guy and pick him up.

00:45:51.952 --> 00:45:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Hey, get your pop on the phone.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Bring him in.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Sweet.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.130 align:middle line:84%
For some of the other
downloads, I'll just share--

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is, again,
confirmation.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When humans were being
created I'm assuming,

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:84%
like the hybridization
programs now, there

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:90%
was a policing happening.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the downloads I
got from my Mantis encounter

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:84%
was that a faction of the
Reptilian energy consciousness.

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Draconian-- this is
sort of what came through me,

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:90%
my interpretation of it--

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.475 align:middle line:84%
desired because they were stuck
in their evolutionary scale--

00:46:40.475 --> 00:46:41.275 align:middle line:90%
scales.

00:46:41.275 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Scale.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, scale.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Then they called out
to a feminine energy,

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian-like energy--

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't if it was specifically
Pleiadians, but more

00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of a feminine energy--
to co-create a way out,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.580 align:middle line:84%
so to say, a way
out of evolution

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:13.660 align:middle line:84%
because of the archetypes
of that Reptilian energy.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Can he say anything about
that or go into any detail?

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.583 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:22.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So definitely a
huge confirmation

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.340 align:middle line:90%
that they were very stuck.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them still
are very stuck within

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.705 align:middle line:90%
their own spiritual and--

00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:84%
in technology, they're
pretty advanced.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But spiritually, and
even genetically,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.170 align:middle line:84%
they can be quite
far behind, because--

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:46.590 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they can just be stuck
in that service-to-self sort

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.680 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Khan did say that,
back in the day--

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:90%
so this is going a while back--

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:84%
when they did call
out for some help,

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
there's only a few individuals
who called for help.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Those individuals got picked
up by the Galactic Federation

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and started working for
the Galactic Federation.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe that's that divine
feminine energy that came

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:84%
in and picked them up
and said, absolutely.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing to
go within, then we're

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:90%
willing to get you there.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So answering the call was
the Federation, in a sense.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:17.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:17.385 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Answering the call
was the Federation.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And it usually is.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
the human creation

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.570 align:middle line:84%
was multiple beings
then connecting with--

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I had sort of seen it as a
feminine energy connecting

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.550 align:middle line:84%
with the Draconian energy
was this human experiment was

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.022 align:middle line:84%
to help that Draconian
energy evolve,

00:48:38.022 --> 00:48:39.480 align:middle line:84%
was the way it was
presented to me.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could go into
some of the other races that

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.370 align:middle line:84%
combined with that specific--
and we may be far removed down

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was trying to go back
to the origin story of humans.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So I've channeled this
many times before.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily Khan who
has this particular information

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:90%
about the origins.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:08.190 align:middle line:84%
From what I've seen in astral
traveling into human history's

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:12.210 align:middle line:84%
past, it was the Anunnaki
who originally came here

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and who wanted, basically,
a slave race to mine gold.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I even just went into a
lifetime the other day

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of a client of mine who was
are those gold-mining slaves.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It was so interesting.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, and so the
Anunnaki came here,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.510 align:middle line:84%
utilized humanity, really
developed humanity to a point

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.460 align:middle line:84%
where they can just
basically follow orders

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than the more Neanderthal
type of energy and bodies.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the Reptilians said,
hey, we're on this planet.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't just utilize
our resources and be here.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So the Reptilians--
the Draconians,

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.957 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call them-- they've

00:49:50.957 --> 00:49:53.250 align:middle line:84%
been here long before the
Anunnaki were ever here.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:84%
They were here long before the
human beings were ever here.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And they felt gypped.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.360 align:middle line:84%
They felt like, all
of a sudden, there's

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.850 align:middle line:84%
all this commotion that's
happening on their planet.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're
not involved in it.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So because of their
outcry, and their pushback,

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.160 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki are like, OK,
do you want in on this?

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We'll also take your
DNA and combine it

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.690 align:middle line:90%
with the human beings.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you're
a part of the mix.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, for a very long time,
it was these giant humanoid

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.380 align:middle line:90%
beings-- these Anunnaki beings--

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.600 align:middle line:90%
along with the Raptoids.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a mix
of Pleiadians, and angels,

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and other beings who were
swooping in and trying to help

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:90%
the chaos and the confusion.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was also a
lot of overpowering

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.560 align:middle line:90%
individual free will.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a no-no with
the Galactic Federation.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
non-intervention policies.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, the
Galactic Federation--

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.620 align:middle line:90%
there was a point in time--

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and I remember this
lifetime very clearly,

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:90%
because I was a part of it.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is back
in ancient Egypt.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Galactic Federation
came down and said,

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.000 align:middle line:84%
you are no longer
allowed to interfere

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:90%
with humanity's progression.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.817 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
get out of here.

00:51:05.817 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
off the planet.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the GFL came
through kind of as

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that policing, governmental
force, kicked off the Anunnaki.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But the Reptilians
said, we're not leaving.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.080 align:middle line:90%
This is our planet.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.550 align:middle line:90%
We deserve to be here.

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Let us stay.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there was maybe
about 25% of Reptilians

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:90%
who left and went off planet.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.680 align:middle line:90%
The majority of them stayed.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But the Galactic Federation
said, you can be here,

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
but this planet was
always prophesized

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.210 align:middle line:90%
to be the planet for the humans.

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.838 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to let you
stay, but you can't-- still,

00:51:36.838 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:84%
you can no longer have
involvement with the human

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.680 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go somewhere
else where they're not

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to see you.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:44.790 align:middle line:90%
They went underground.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And they started to make
all of these cavern systems.

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And they started to basically
live-- these Reptilians live

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.050 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, because of that
genealogy and the gene splicing

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that was created with
the human beings,

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians were actually able
to shift themselves and come

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.700 align:middle line:84%
into the bodies of human beings,
especially the human beings who

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.780 align:middle line:84%
had a higher percentage of
Draconian and Reptilian DNA.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It was easier for them
to control or take

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:90%
over that human body.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:90%
They kept it in the bloodlines.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of
the royal families

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.910 align:middle line:84%
have the higher percentage
of the Reptilian DNA.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they
are those shape shifters

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:84%
who are running
things at this time.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's two things where
the Reptilians come into play.

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They are extremely
spiteful over humans,

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.480 align:middle line:84%
because humans have a lot
higher vibrational DNA

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:90%
than just the Reptilians.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.750 align:middle line:90%
So humans can travel dimensions.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Reptilians can't.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:45.785 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck in the
fourth dimension.

00:52:45.785 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So humans can do
a lot of things,

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.745 align:middle line:84%
but we're much
newer than they are.

00:52:48.745 --> 00:52:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of spite there.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.245 align:middle line:84%
And there's even more
resentment for the fact

00:52:52.245 --> 00:52:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that humans are now traipsing
around their planet,

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and they're forced underground.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So they feel like,
any way that they can,

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.510 align:middle line:84%
they want to take
that power back.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But once again,
there's many Reptilians

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:84%
who work in tandem with
the Galactic Federation.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:90%
They're here for our awakening.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't agree with the
majority of their population.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And they want to help humans.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's
a little history

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.930 align:middle line:90%
with what I've channeled.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does Khan have
to say about all that?

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.825 align:middle line:90%
Have they just been policing?

00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:24.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Making sure that-- standing
in the corner like,

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.990 align:middle line:84%
all right, there's a
lot happening here.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What was Khan's role?

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:90%
So he has been standing back.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.140 align:middle line:84%
He understands where
humanity came from.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, he was very
aware of the prophecy

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of the human beings
to begin with.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't surprised that
things got very explosive

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:84%
very quickly and very out
of control very quickly.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.440 align:middle line:84%
He kind of knew that
that was going to happen.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was just kind
of the creation of one

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:90%
of the most epic species.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It was bound to have some
hiccups, and some infringement,

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and those kind of things.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So he's calling this planet
the precipice of evolution.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we can all get along,
if we can evolve ourselves,

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.750 align:middle line:84%
if we can love one another--
no matter if you have more

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Reptilian DNA, or Anunnaki
DNA, or angelic DNA--

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.110 align:middle line:84%
if we can really
all come together

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:27.790 align:middle line:84%
with this collective
consciousness,

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:31.240 align:middle line:84%
with this higher vibration
of love, then we've done it.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of the pain, and
the chaos, and the wars

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that have sprouted because
of those differences--

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.260 align:middle line:90%
that's not in vain.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.945 align:middle line:84%
That all needed to happen to
get to where we are right now.

00:54:43.945 --> 00:54:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're kind of the center
of the universe right now.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> We kind of are.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:90%
All eyes are on us.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
channeling years ago,

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:53.407 align:middle line:84%
I started to
realize, OK, so we're

00:54:53.407 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:90%
a third-dimensional species.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have 8th
dimensional, 11th dimensional,

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:02.070 align:middle line:84%
6th dimensional
beings all over us?

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to understand
how powerful we actually are

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.722 align:middle line:84%
and how magnificent it
is to be here right now.

00:55:10.722 --> 00:55:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> The cosmic blender, right?

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The cosmic blender--

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.380 align:middle line:90%
going back to that blender.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of times, people
who have had interactions with

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.070 align:middle line:84%
angels-- archangels,
that type of energy--

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:31.533 align:middle line:84%
they say the energy of the
Mantis is also very similar.

00:55:31.533 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Does he have anything
to say about that?

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good question.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:84%
He said-- this is kind
of funny, because Khan

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.160 align:middle line:90%
be funny sometimes.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>> He's making a joke.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> He's saying-- he thinks
it's a joke, anyway.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:48.710 align:middle line:90%
But he says--

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> He says, yes, we are like,
as you say, Switzerland.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So they just really
don't choose sides.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're very objective.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
aware of things.

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And so he's just
saying, absolutely.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We could be compared
to that kind of energy,

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.730 align:middle line:90%
because they don't react.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't attach.

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:10.740 align:middle line:90%
They don't choose sides.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.720 align:middle line:84%
They're just always
kind of there.

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very loving,
open presence to them

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:90%
because they don't choose sides.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
always completely

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.360 align:middle line:84%
compassionate over every
phase of every species

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in their existence because
they've been there, too.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they working with angels?

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:90%
He says, not necessarily.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But he works with--

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:39.210 align:middle line:84%
they work with many
different species

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:40.450 align:middle line:90%
all across the universe.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So they don't specifically
just work with the angels.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:45.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't specifically
just work with the humans.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're just everywhere.

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They've planted their seeds
all across this universe.

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So they're like the
Federation counselors--

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> --in a sense.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even beyond
the Federation,

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.780 align:middle line:84%
because I think the Mantoid
beings were around long before

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.130 align:middle line:90%
the Galactic Federation was.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't want to
say that they're above,

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.560 align:middle line:84%
especially the ones who
are incarnated in bodies.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They definitely work
with the Federation.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But they can't
really be bothered

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:16.400 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of structure.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond structure.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond structure.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.300 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, super glad
Khan could come in

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and share the Mantis knowledge
and the Mantis energy.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Big fan.

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:29.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been there, been
having those interactions.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Hopefully, you have more.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And I will be calling.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Lovely.

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Elizabeth.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Reuben.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:42.990 align:middle line:90%
