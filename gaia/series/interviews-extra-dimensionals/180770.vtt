00:00:03.976 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we are
in lovely Sedona.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Amazing property here.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Thank you to Dana for
letting us use his place.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Gorgeous.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you for showing
up in this awesome vortex spot

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of crazy interdimensional
cosmic high-wave energy.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfectly put.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:90%
And you too.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't get it
out for this place.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
So any opportunity to come--

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad our timelines
merged, pathways merged.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, this spot in this land
is such a sacred area always.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You are from the Netherlands.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're here in America
doing traveling and doing

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:90%
your work.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Following my heart.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Following your heart.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about that.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
What is your work, your
play, your what you're doing?

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:90%
And how does it all start?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, OK.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I'm traveling
as an interstellar channel.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I do group Q&As with people.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm channeling
my interstellar guide

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Arjun, who is of the
Yahyel, as I understand it.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And I also do private
sessions, one-on-ones,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that are a little bit different
than the groups because it goes

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:90%
really in-depth.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And receiver is laying down.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's mixed between
energy work, Q&A

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
because there is
definitely a dialogue.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And it accelerates
and streamlines

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the self-healing properties of
the body if the receiver can

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
match the frequencies that I
could say the ETs are offering.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Arjun works with a team.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's never boring, or
it's never just one guide.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
But he's my hub,
as I understand it,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and he translates
information through me.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I allow that to flow through
and share it with other people

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'm, basically,
in love with this work

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and with their energies.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And everything started
to come together

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
for me into this kind of work
about 2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.708 align:middle line:90%
>> Fairly recent then.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That is fairly recent.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, stepping forward with
the focal channeling, I mean.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And years before that,
I was writing it down.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But I've been receiving
downloads of information

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and having visitation
experiences

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and physical experiences with
what I believe or understand

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to be the interstellar
family members since I

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:90%
was a child, since age 3.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was
quite a journey

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to understand what was going on.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe, I guess,
it's less common.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:90%
The idea of contact and--

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's not
spoken of that much.

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Or at least it wasn't
in my childhood.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --abduction, temporary
detainment, all of these.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That was totally
unknown phenomena to me

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
until maybe at age 26, I
started hearing about that.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
wow, how about that?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had
personal experiences,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't have any
relation point to say, OK,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.325 align:middle line:84%
this is not just me
having this experience.

00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
having this too.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
You didn't really
think about that?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it
seemed to be just me.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You thought it was
just you until 26.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it was eye-opening
for me because, wow,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I just thought something wasn't
all together right maybe.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:90%
I knew it wasn't ghosts.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was other than
people that have diseased.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
can channel that too.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that wasn't it,
but I couldn't pinpoint it

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into sci-fi.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Because all films
with shooting in it,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.795 align:middle line:84%
I was super sensitive
to all of that.

00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
So for a long time, I was just--

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
well, I learned how to
embrace it within myself,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:90%
so I found a way with it.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But I kept it to myself
for a very, very long time

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and used the
information for myself.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Already as a child,
I had experiences.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was going
somewhere else in the night

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and being brought back.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
And I learned lessons.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And I could embrace
them so easily.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And the conviction of it was so
strong, it was so heart-based.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
What just confused
me at the time

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
was that my teachers
in school were teaching

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:90%
totally different things.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The teachers
of like regular--

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The normal primary school.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Primary school, right.

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So that was confusing.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Different things in
the sense of history?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Or what kind of
things were different?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> History, but also
definitely the way--

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I as a child was being
taught how you will

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:90%
grow up and go into society.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:90%
It was very much--

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Structured.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And this way, you're going
to be a lawyer, a doctor.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You study something, you
become that one thing.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Go to college.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.568 align:middle line:90%
>> You choose a profession.

00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You need to know
what you want to be.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It was very strict
in that sense.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And the messages you were
getting were not of that sense?

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Follow your heart, do what
you feel fits your core energy.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is much more intuitive
than the professions that

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
are usually offered to you.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So very young, I
decided I wanted

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to do something with art
because drawing was my language.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't speaking.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a part that I was
a really quiet kid, which

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.235 align:middle line:84%
most people probably wouldn't
expect when they meet me now.

00:07:12.235 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And all the teachers
were probably saying,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
this is just a hobby, you
can't make money at this,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.487 align:middle line:90%
you can't do anything.

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:18.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not raised to
believe-- like the societies

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
or artists, bohemian lifestyle,
where is this ever going to go?

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it time for
something more serious?

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:10%
So that never worked for me.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that very young.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In school, there were lessons
coming from a teacher.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
why I understood

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't the way.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But that became more clear
throughout my puberty.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
The visitations
became more intense.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely a
time that I resisted it.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is
getting too crazy,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.923 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this anymore.

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:56.457 align:middle line:90%
I was living a double life.

00:07:56.457 --> 00:07:57.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:07:57.365 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> But that was all--

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I can see now when I
look in retrospect,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that was all because I didn't
understand what was going on.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then at age 24, I
actually sought help.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Like medical help?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought I needed to
speak at least to someone

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that I feel safe speaking to
and sharing this story because I

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
was keeping it in for so long.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:90%
But then I was in art school.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So art was a beautiful
and natural outlet for me

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
to share or to process more what
was going on in my life before.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to see a--

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think you call it
a psychotherapist.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychiatrist,
psychotherapist.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:90%
That works too.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The most easy one
that they send you to.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.487 align:middle line:84%
And he appeared to be
an ex-hypnotherapist.

00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Which was great because
he could really feel

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:90%
into my story very intuitively.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:90%
So we understood each other.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And he just reflected to me
exactly what I needed to know.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you can
work with these "dreams,"

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:90%
that is not the enemy.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It's you speaking to you.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And then it clicked so quickly.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I only needed just a few
conversations with him

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to grasp it and suddenly be
like, oh, OK, this is it.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And only a few months after
that, I saw my first UFO.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
started accelerating.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you sort of accepted
it, then that created the space

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and the pathways.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
The pipes were free to--

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Through which more
information could come without

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:90%
freaking me out.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really the freak
factor that sort of kept those

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
doors semi-closed, even
though it was still happening.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And you just feel resistance.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I was super shy
and, as a child,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
afraid of judgments
from outside.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I was raised Christian,
so this is super

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
leaning towards the
unexplainable, you know,

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
what from the Christian
side is just evil.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:90%
So I kept it to myself.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was good, I
knew it wasn't evil.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.822 align:middle line:84%
But I knew it was
other, and people

00:10:08.822 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:90%
might respond to it that way.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and you didn't want to
be demonized as some people who

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:90%
do come out with this.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been
much harder in the past.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
heaven right now.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you're doing,
you're interviewing--

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We're having a conversation
about ETs and talking to them.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Coming home, that's
what it is to me.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like, oh, man,
now I'm surrendering to it.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going with the flow.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us a
little bit about Arjun,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
the Yahyel, your understanding
of that alien race, society.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:10%
What kind of messages are
you getting in that sense?

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So I understand
he's of a hybrid race.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
They exist out of--

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:90%
that sounds so technical.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They are result of the
future human race--

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
one future human
race, one timeline--

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that found themselves eventually
at a dead end, you could say.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>> The Zetas, essentially.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
The Zeta story.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So we've covered this story.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, great, so
I don't have to.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's technically
what I understand

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the Yahyel are-- the last,
the youngest race that

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%
came out of that experiment.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They're very much
like us physically.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And Arjun looks-- he's a
little taller than I am.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
He's blond.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
He has a slight curl,
he has blue eyes.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.607 align:middle line:84%
First, I thought he was a
Pleiadian because of the looks.

00:11:59.607 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we sort of had
this classification.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.107 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
this, or maybe I'll

00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:90%
ask Arjun this later.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.628 align:middle line:84%
We have this idea of
Pleiadians being this way.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I've talked to
other Pleiadian channels,

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.545 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, oh,
no, we have Cat people,

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
we have all these different--
there's many types.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I was also just going
by the pictures in the books,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.193 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking, oh,
this must be the Pleiadian.

00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Because he was so light.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's also, I
think, the energy.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever say
there is other races?

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:37.917 align:middle line:84%
Do we have black or
Hispanic-looking Yahyel beings?

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> They have colors.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They have different colors
and different hair color.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Again, we can go into that
later with those guys.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But he's knowing
me my whole life.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
We made a pre-my birth agreement
to do this if I wanted to.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is always a
free choice agreement.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I decided to do it, to
test it out, in a sense.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So I did art school,
I was an artist first.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a
life coach, overcoming

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
my fear of working with
people, in a sense,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and really wanting to share
the heart's message that

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:90%
was already kicking in there.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And from a life coach, I
went to this channeling work,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
which basically took the life
coaching over in a few months,

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
come out with that.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're sort of life
coaching through the channeling

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, yes.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You are guiding people.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the same mission, if
you want to look at it that way.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Just helping people
along with your stuff.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And I just have a lot
of assistance now.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And Arjun works with a
big bunch of other races.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of a
steady healing team

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
present when I do the
groups or private sessions.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you had direct
communication with those guys?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one I know
from since I was a child.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:90%
He's a Mantid being.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the three in
this study team, I call it.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Three Mantis beings?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:90%
There's three beings--

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Sirius, Mantid, and Sassani.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And these three work with
Arjun, who is Yahyel.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So they work together
a lot, I understand.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It's much more flexible and
interwoven-- is that a word?--

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> --than maybe you would think
when you just dive into this.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
They're not super
separated races.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:90%
They do a lot of stuff together.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And the Mantid being, is he--

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember him from
visitations in my childhood.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I guess he comes
through separate then.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Not just as a team, but
they actually come--

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:90%
do they come separate?

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they are a team.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:90%
They really work together.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.112 align:middle line:84%
>> They always are a
team, always together.

00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> They're like, OK, when we're
going to go communicate with

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Wieteke, this is what we--

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
they don't come individually?

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Like would Mantid say, hey,
I'm just checking and say hi?

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Then Arjun would translate
their messages to me.

00:15:06.852 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
That's constantly
what's happening.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Arjun is my hub, so we are
really, really close, also

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:90%
even genetically somehow.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Throughout my family line, with
the DNA, there is a connection.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's easiest
to have this one study guide

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and translate the
other ones to me.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's with Rob Gauthier.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.997 align:middle line:84%
He uses TReb to access all
these other different beings.

00:15:32.997 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> As his hub, yeah.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> As his hub.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:90%
And we joke about it.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:90%
He goes fishing with TReb.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, all these
other beings can come through.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's sort of
oblivious to it.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But he has many beings coming
through him all the time.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So all I see,
basically-- well, I

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
do get the images
of the other beings

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.118 align:middle line:84%
if there's a cross-connection
going on like that.

00:15:55.118 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I have a question
in the background,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I can actually have
a Q&A with a person

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
or facilitate the Q&A between
Arjun and the questioner

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and have a question of
myself in the background.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.613 align:middle line:90%
And in my mind--

00:16:05.613 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe it sounds weird-- but
I'd turn my head to the right.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:90%
He's always on the right side.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Arjun.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And I will see his expression.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And he can actually answer
my questions in the back.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And my attention
goes to the left.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
There's this--

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Left-right.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, movement always
happening when I go

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
into channeling as well.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I kind of fall to the
left, and then Arjun

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:90%
comes from the right.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the Mantoid
being have a name?

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> He's just Mantoid guy.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't asked
for a name either.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I did ask Arjun for
a name at some point

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't use a name
either in the beginning.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So for months, it was just
my Yahyel guide or parallel

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
version of myself, because he
is a feature version of me.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really ask
for names in the team.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Although the Sassani is a
female, and her name is Nanuk.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Nanuk.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got that name while I was
painting her face, because I'm

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:90%
painting my team at the moment.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to have
portraits of them,

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and I'm working on that now.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
because I get

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.812 align:middle line:84%
to see in my head
what they look like.

00:17:12.812 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But then maybe sometimes
they want to dress up,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
they want to look
a little different.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
That they let me know, OK,
just this and this symbol

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
because that's the theme
I'm representing for you

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:90%
or for a client, for instance.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So art is still a big part
of my work in a sense.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It's very visual.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe the Sirian
and the Sassani being at all?

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was
painting Nanuk's face--

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%
she's the Sassani being--

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
she inspired me, you could
say, to put a sun and a moon

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
on her forehead.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And later, I got a
dream that explained

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
how she was about balancing
energies, male and female.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of her
role in the healing team.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And she's really
connected to nature.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:06.023 align:middle line:84%
So they all have their own
little niche, something

00:18:06.023 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
that they're really good at.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Mantid being is really
amazing with bone structures,

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
skeleton, the doctor's kind
of work, realigning the more

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:90%
tough stuff, in a sense.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know another
translation for it,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
but electro currents-- he's
really strong with that.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Electromagnetics?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in the body.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.555 align:middle line:84%
And he works on the
brain very strongly.

00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
We have this particular
thing going on.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
He was there since
I was a child,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and we did a lot of
frequency matching.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:90%
So I understand how he works.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's part of the
energy, you could say,

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that moves my hands when
I do a healing session.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
The movements that
go with the healing

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
amplify the work that is
being done on an astral level

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:90%
because they use my energy body.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, they wouldn't
necessarily need my body.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But because we are physical,
I'm like the portal, in a sense,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
physicalizing the movements
here, getting even closer

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:90%
to the other person.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, movement is so huge.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's really big.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And moving energy, we
don't necessarily do that.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But just in this
motion of the hands--

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really big.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially martial artists
really understand this with

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:90%
energy work.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Chi Gong, Tai Chi,
Kung Fu, all of

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
these different
physical movements

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
actually move energetics.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:19:39.255 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Create the space.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And that can
come very precise.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And I love to work
with them in that way.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And the Sirian being is--

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
this is really hard
to put in words.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's really the bigger
electromagnetic field,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
boosting it with light and
rebalancing in that way.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a level
around you in a sense.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I do sometimes
work with my hands

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
up very high and
sometimes much closer.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And the being that fits in with
that part of the energy body

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
will assist.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, everything is,
of course, one and connected.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But they do really
know how to streamline

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:90%
certain parts in the system.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a group
Q&A, they're there,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and they work in the back
for those who from the heart

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
wish some assistance on
maybe whatever kind of topic

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:90%
is with them.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And they speak through Arjun.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.723 align:middle line:84%
The other's information
comes through.

00:20:33.723 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So did they ever come forward
and say, hi, I'm Mantis guy?

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.293 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not their role.

00:20:38.293 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Very clearly not their role.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really just
communicating through Arjun,

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:90%
through you.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Adding to the information for
the questioner to get a clearer

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.685 align:middle line:84%
picture of what their higher
mind wants to come through

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:90%
to their conscious minds.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that's their common
goal-- to reflect to anybody

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.293 align:middle line:84%
their own inner
rhythm, in a sense.

00:20:59.293 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
They're just putting it
into words, the things

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that we with our rational
mind don't focus on

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
that much, I guess.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we can, but
we weren't taught to.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.342 align:middle line:84%
So it's still, for most
people, blind spots.

00:21:14.342 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And for me as well sometimes.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I really need some
good reflections.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And the work you do
with the energy healing--

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and you did a session
for me yesterday--

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that work, using
your cosmic clan

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with my
cosmic clan and then help

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.317 align:middle line:90%
reflect that.

00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of how--

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's all coming together and
coming out as one storyline,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the information
that's coming through.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not necessarily your
cosmic clan saying this per se.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
are maybe better

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:90%
communicators to my cosmic clan.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And they can say,
OK, his cosmic clan

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:90%
is saying this, so do this.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that they're--

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.147 align:middle line:84%
we have this idea of
how psychics work.

00:22:14.147 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And they can read our minds
and go into this stuff

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and do other stuff.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, what's
probably really happening

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is just my cosmic
guides communicate

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:90%
with your cosmic guides.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have a clearer
channel to your cosmic team

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.156 align:middle line:90%
than I do.

00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I don't know.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I would say you do
because you're able to have

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
those dialogues in
the work you're doing.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.982 align:middle line:90%
>> I think everybody can.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I think everybody can too.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But of course, I
will say it's both.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.713 align:middle line:84%
Because some people need a
little bit more training back,

00:22:47.713 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
which is really what I
would want to call it--

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
training back into that
actually natural state.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that's our nature
to have that very open.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole idea of
shamanism and shamanic

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:84%
practices with our
native cultures,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of what they, from
my understanding training with

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
when someone would go
to visit the shaman,

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in essence, they're
doing the same thing.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
[WIND CHIMES RING]

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is connecting to
the other person's guides.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the guides are telling
them to do this work.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> As opposed to, I'm doing this
work because I'm psychic and I

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:90%
know better.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I even don't like that.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I avoid even the word
"healer" on my website,

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
for instance, because
I'm just a facilitator.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting stuff through.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I never know what's
going to happen.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a preset idea
about what somebody would

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:90%
need because I don't know that.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That other person
actually knows best.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So all that is being
asked for in that moment

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and being allowed
in as a reflection

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:90%
of their own inner wisdom.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think as we define and
understand these terms better,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:84%
we can tell this
story now in this way.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe before,
we didn't have

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
the understanding,
or the knowledge

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.075 align:middle line:90%
to go that deep into it.

00:24:13.075 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So we just said, yeah, I'm a
healer, and I'm healing you.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we go, yeah,
you're healing me.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.012 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, nobody's
healing anybody else.

00:24:20.012 --> 00:24:21.645 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also feeling
it eventually.

00:24:21.645 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually,
it's self-healing.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm just giving--

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.303 align:middle line:90%
it's the permission slip thing--

00:24:25.303 --> 00:24:27.746 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you permission.

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:31.165 align:middle line:90%
It's tricking myself in this.

00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm doing
the healing work.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But just because of
the way my mind works

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and the construct
of my reality, I

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
need this physicalized outside
thing to do the healing.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But that still takes away
a little bit of the idea of--

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
you used the word "need"
in this description.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I guess I'm
not saying that I need that.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that that's the
way of a lot of our old ways

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:10.320 align:middle line:90%
of looking at things.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And many people too-- you
know, going to the doctor,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
getting the surgery, taking
the pill, all of this

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:22.192 align:middle line:90%
is really an illusion.

00:25:22.192 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a belief
system, all of it.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a belief system.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
All of it is just there for, you
know, pharmaceutical companies

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:90%
to make lots of money.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they are so
keen on supporting the illusion.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but you
cannot do it alone.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't do it alone, no.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:90%
This is disempowering.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the name of the
game for those structures

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
that are in place in order
for us to be reliant on them.

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they feed off of.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of
vampire-type energy that

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
can grow because that's the
archetype of that energy.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there's the trap a
little bit to think that that

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is just being pursued
in the center,

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
continued even in
nowadays healing work,

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
even if you're a very
new paradigm about it.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this, so I
want to throw this in.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.993 align:middle line:84%
And Arjun-- because I have
my own doubts about this,

00:26:29.993 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
before I started doing
private sessions,

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure if I wanted
to be a part of that idea

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that somebody would
come to me for help.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him, so
how do you look at this?

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well,
you've all decided

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to be with a lot of people
here, a lot of reflections

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's also
playful, and joyful,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful to look
in each other's mirror.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
when you fall in love.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:90%
It's when you pick your friends.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It's even when you
pick your family,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
even though that doesn't always
look like such a pretty mirror.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But all of that
is part of a dance

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:90%
that you chose to be a part of.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So that helped me also
understand and embrace

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
even the old paradigm
medical system a little more,

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to be like, OK,
it is what it is.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And whatever direction
you navigate to most,

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:90%
just choose that.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And I also go for regular
reflections, I would say,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
with colleague
interstellar healers

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that are channelers, who
facilitate realignments

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:84%
to get some more insights
on my own blind spots.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because there are always
things that you're

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:90%
learning about and expanding.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always good to
have another perspective.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally, yes.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So go get a second opinion.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.707 align:middle line:90%
I love more angles to a topic.

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
The more the better.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I will pick the one
that resonates most with me.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
No one is better
than the other--

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's all good.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --for the collective.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.268 align:middle line:84%
But for the individual, you
may have better resonance.

00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the
whole journey, I think,

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
for me to collect the
guts, I would say,

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to be faithful to what I
feel resonates most with me.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And just like I said, I
fell in love with this work.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You've sort of awoken to
the Yahyel channeling by going

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:90%
to another channeler?

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in a sense.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So I've been receiving all
these downloads, mainly

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
in night times, or just
before waking, astral travel

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I went to see
Darryl Anka channeling Bashar.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered him
after reading Seth.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So the steps that
I went are actually

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
pretty similar to his
story, now I understand.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw UFO 10 years
before discovering Seth.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I got into
it more, understanding

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that there are actually
people out there

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
sharing this information and
not just walking around with it,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:90%
keeping it inside.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So divine synchronicity
helped me to actually attend

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:20.448 align:middle line:84%
to one of his group sessions--
the way Darryl channels Bashar.

00:29:20.448 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in the audience,
I didn't have any questions.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I was just feeling at home
and being in a bliss state

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
being with these
energies, because it

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
felt so much at home,
but not really questions.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there,
and at some point,

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
the sounds kind of
went down, the lights

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
dimmed, in my experience,
even though I was

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:90%
sitting between other people.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I felt super drawn inwards,
so I had to close my eyes.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.635 align:middle line:84%
And I felt other
beings around me.

00:29:48.635 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And to have this
experience in a waking

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:90%
state, that was new to me.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So I felt very
clearly that there

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:90%
was work being done on me.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And I could fully relax in it.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It felt super loving.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, oh, I'm in good
hands, this is beautiful.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And then a picture was
given to me of, basically,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:90%
a cat sitting on my head.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And the energy that surrounded
that was very giggly-like,

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:90%
joyful, "this is funny."

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.243 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK--

00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like, this is you, and
the cat is on your head,

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's funny,
and I'm like, OK.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And that whole thing
lasted maybe 10 minutes.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a little bit
out-of-time-ish for me.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that first half of
the channeling also ended.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And the sounds came back
into the room for me,

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:84%
the lights went on
again, you could say.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.382 align:middle line:84%
And I was left with
that feeling that a cat

00:30:44.382 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:90%
was sitting on my head.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Like an actual pressure,
I could really feel it.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was hesitant to
move because I thought

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
it might fall off, even though
I knew it wasn't really there.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And a year later,
in the Netherlands,

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I went to see an
ET channeler woman.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And she lives in the
Netherlands as well.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:10.225 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went to have
my back straightened out.

00:31:10.225 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I had some issues there
between my shoulders.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
She said she did
channeling and worked

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
with a team that does
also physical healings

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:84%
or, like we understand,
a realignment

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:84%
of your own
self-healing abilities.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was curious about
that, so I went there.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And a month before
I went to see her,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Arjun actually
started speaking out

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
loud to me, which
was quite a surprise

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for me because he was
coming closer and closer.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd seen his face.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was with me
during meditations.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point,
I asked in my mind,

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I just opened conversation-- and
he had been waiting for that,

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I understand that now--

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:90%
asking, who are you?

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I got this huge
spelling out, Yah-Yel.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Like for him, it was more
logical to first pinpoint--

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:84%
this is who we
are as a race more

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
where I am from
then to use a name,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:90%
because they don't use names.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was instantly confused,
thinking, is that his name?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.005 align:middle line:90%
But that's actually a race.

00:32:12.005 --> 00:32:12.805 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you hear about
the Yahyel race before?

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I heard
about that by then.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> By Darryl or
other channelers?

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, through Darryl.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:90%
And so it confused me.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But also that the answer was
so super crispy clear and loud,

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that confused me.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So I instantly like,
whoa, backed away

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
from it not knowing what to
do with it, left it at that.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, I
went to see this woman.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And she started
channeling for me.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And maybe two minutes
into working on my back

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.683 align:middle line:90%
with her team--

00:32:46.683 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it a private session?

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> A private session, yes.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was laying on
this massage table.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And she started
to look at my back

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and what could be done maybe
according to her guides.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then Arjun was just
jumping up and down like,

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
hey, hello, I've been trying
to get to this girl for quite

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:90%
some time now.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, there's
somebody here for you.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And then she just
started speaking for him,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have to throw this little
thing I forgot to tell you.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Just before the
session, she has a cat

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that is basically
identical to the one that

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:90%
was put on my head.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.028 align:middle line:84%
But I did not make
that connection.

00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:26.695 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to
ask, what kind of cat?

00:33:26.695 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a Nordic Forest cat.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty big.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
They have long fur, a
little bit longer snout,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:90%
cute head, so pretty big.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And it jumped on
the table with me.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And it laid down
next to my feet.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was just there
rolled up and purring.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then she started channeling
Arjun for me, who said,

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're ready from head
to toe to do this kind of work

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
yourself if you want to
because we have this agreement.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
explaining that he is Yahyel.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
understand, oh, wow.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Or she got it through.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
She translated it as she
thought his name was Shayel

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because maybe she didn't
know about the race,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.460 align:middle line:90%
so this was funny.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
But at least, it gave
me the synchronicity

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand that what happened
a month earlier was actually

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%
not my imagination.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.889 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a lot of
things happening.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
floating off the table.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:90%
I was really buzzing.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving me all
this specific information

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.427 align:middle line:84%
about my childhood, how
dad visited me before.

00:34:30.427 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
And everything started to
come together all of a sudden

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It took me about three days to
get used to the entire idea.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a
life coach by then,

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I picked out some
open-minded clients.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so are you
up for an experiment?

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit about
your art and how that was

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
an influence in maybe
transitioning to where you are

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.508 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:34:59.508 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it was always there.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've
seen many of your--

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your art incorporates
extraterrestrial themes.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And when did that start?

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Just from when you
were very little?

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I have some childhood
drawings in which I'm already

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
attempting at that age to draw
the classrooms and where I

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:90%
believe I went--

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
what I call astral
school, where I

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
got the lessons about
universe and how things work.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I would make drawings
of birds with the sky

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
inside the bird instead of
the bird inside the sky.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Because everything was a loop.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And I got that.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.533 align:middle line:90%
And I have these drawings.

00:35:36.533 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And I made them at
age four or five.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so surprised.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually rediscovered
these drawings--

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I thought they were gone--

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:90%
only three years ago.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of stuff is also being
thrown out, kids stuff,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:90%
but this is still there.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's always been my
outlet for translating

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%
what was coming in.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So in my diaries as a
teenager, starting 12,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I was also making diagrams
of how I understood

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.607 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos looked like.

00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was having
questions like, there

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.970 align:middle line:84%
must be an edge to
this whole universe,

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:90%
so what is outside of that?

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And then intuitively
understanding

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that the more you go outside,
it must look the same

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:90%
as when you go really inside.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.125 align:middle line:84%
And then going into research
biology and fractals--

00:36:27.125 --> 00:36:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing that
for fun at age 17,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
getting books from the library
just because I felt drawn

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of information.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But it made no sense at all,
not even for my profession

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:90%
as an artist.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to necessarily
read, for instance, philosophy

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I was really into
Nietzsche and Young.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.572 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to understand
how the mind works.

00:36:48.572 --> 00:36:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And then I discovered--

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a lot of
artists out there that explore

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:90%
those themes.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It is very intuitive.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It is another language.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it Da--

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.838 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, my appreciation
for art is there,

00:37:02.838 --> 00:37:04.130 align:middle line:90%
but I forget everybody's names.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But is it the guy who writes
the melting clocks all the time?

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Salvador Dali?

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Dali, that's right.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And then is that
the same guy that

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
does those weird dimensional
drawings like the stairs going

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:90%
this way and--

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Escher.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Escher, yes, great.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So these guys, I think,
they're probably--

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I was obsessed by that.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But I really do feel it's
one of the languages that's

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.380 align:middle line:84%
very close to the
interstellar speech.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Plus is music, by the
way, and even movement.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.605 align:middle line:84%
Yes, sound, movement,
and visuals.

00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:10%
And if you really
dive into that,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:10%
yes, I think it's
maybe only logical

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.620 align:middle line:10%
that you end up wanting to
know more about philosophy

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:10%
and how things work.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.992 align:middle line:90%
But I was a bit nerdy in that.

00:37:52.992 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I would really go for the books
and dive into the websites,

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and go explore, and
feel that it makes

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:84%
sense, and wanting
to do something

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think all artists
necessarily have that.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we really are entering
this time in humanity where we

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.268 align:middle line:90%
can grasp these concepts.

00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:13.310 align:middle line:84%
We sort of had hints of
it throughout our history

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
with the art.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But now with science going into
the quantum fields and quantum

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:24.080 align:middle line:84%
theory, we're doing
experiments in those realms.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We're really starting to
figure out the universe.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was just posting
an article yesterday,

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
these experiments of how the
present can change the past.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:90%
And we can see this in photons.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And this experiment's been
repeated over and over.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And they call it the eraser
effect, where what we can do

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
here now can actually
literally change the past.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've known from these
channeling works and art

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and everything else that the
only thing that really exists

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.955 align:middle line:90%
is the now anyways.

00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So I find it fascinating
that it's all interconnected.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's great that you
subconsciously tapped into that

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:90%
at a young age.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And that you can change
the past from the present,

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I got that very clearly at
age 26, around and about.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I started rewriting
my childhood literally.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I made a new diary.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Like I piled up all the old
ones and I made a new one.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I tore out all the
drawings and I threw away

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:90%
most of the writings.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.467 align:middle line:90%
I kept the dreams, by the way.

00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like this is
what I want to keep.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And these stories
where I was venting,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that timeline of my childhood,
I let go of very deliberately.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, this is a part--

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to switch to
another timeline.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So I started to rewrite it,
and that was so powerful.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's through this
kind of playing around

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
with the information that I got
for myself that I eventually

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.900 align:middle line:84%
ended up discovering techniques
like tapping and using

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:90%
that as a life coach.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I had experienced
in my own life

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:84%
how powerful these
techniques are and how

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:90%
you can really use them.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And essentially, from
my understanding now,

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked with
tapping and plant medicine work,

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.470 align:middle line:84%
we're essentially going
into these quantum states

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and rewriting the story,
shifting timelines per se.

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> On a cellular level,
actually opening up--

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:84%
there's these little portals,
in a sense, in your body.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So when I do the
private sessions,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I get to see these details.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And I want to actually
see if I can make

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Photoshop examples of that.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's a great video--

00:40:38.793 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I post this all the
time-- out there,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:46.810 align:middle line:84%
this YouTube channel called
upriser, what's his name?

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I forgot the guy's name.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But he goes into explaining
how DNA in itself

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a dimensional
doorway for bringing

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:84%
through information
from another dimension.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Gravity as well,
but really the DNA

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
strands and how they
work in the molecules,

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:90%
with hydrogen within water--

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:17.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, two hydrogens
and one oxygen molecule--

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.980 align:middle line:84%
creating portals to bring
through information.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Like gravity, it's all
interconnected into science.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're now merging these
worlds of art, philosophy,

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:30.660 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think quantum physics
is that mechanism we have now

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that really is like, yeah,
this is how the universe works.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think our space brothers
and sisters are like, yeah,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:90%
they're finally getting it.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they are.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
so super patient

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:90%
with those who don't yet.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.270 align:middle line:90%
There's so much love, wow.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It blows me away continuously.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's next?

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:10.413 align:middle line:84%
What's your plan with
this tool of channeling?

00:42:10.413 --> 00:42:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going with it?

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's a funny question.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I never really think
into the future

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that much because I think
that's really weird.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I almost feel my brain
cramp up trying to do that.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.880 align:middle line:90%
That never worked for me.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:90%
So I don't think ahead.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're sort of living
the Yahyel philosophy--

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Already, yeah.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --of synchronicities
and living in the moment.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see what
happens, totally.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Planning ahead really
never worked for me.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:84%
This is why as a
child at school,

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.427 align:middle line:84%
I was already having issues with
the way they see the future.

00:42:44.427 --> 00:42:46.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're going to
do, and then logically, you

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.530 align:middle line:90%
would go to m-m-m.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still not planning
anything, only like loosely.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Like OK, I feel it's time
to move maybe location,

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.660 align:middle line:84%
so I'll move to a
more foresty location.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a plan that
I have right now.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's no stress on
it, there's no deadline.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And I know it will come to me.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.372 align:middle line:84%
The house is basically
already there.

00:43:09.372 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I just have to discover it in
a here and now timeline, which

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:90%
will be there eventually.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So the channeling also is
teaching me to surrender

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:90%
even more to the here and now.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's such a here
and now state to be in,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.315 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing else, everything
else disappears for me.

00:43:30.315 --> 00:43:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> In the channeling state.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, many channelers
these days don't go into that

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.430 align:middle line:90%
deep trance so much.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Are you present and aware?

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm present, but I'm moving
in and out of the amount

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.870 align:middle line:90%
of presence, I guess.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I can move it to the back
a little more and kind of

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.870 align:middle line:84%
lose track of where
things are going.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But I'll still get a hint, OK,
now this dialogue is finished,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:90%
we've gone to the next.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I wake up again, pay
attention to new storyline.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be more present
when I'm doing it in English,

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.260 align:middle line:90%
as it's my second language.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.150 align:middle line:84%
In Dutch, in my first language,
I can drift a little bit more.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Go on autopilot.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a little more.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's in and out.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And if they increase the tempo,
I'm more on one word at a time,

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.125 align:middle line:84%
translating one word
at a time, instead of--

00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had moments where I don't
know where the sentence is

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:84%
going at all, just focusing
on the correct pronunciation

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.170 align:middle line:90%
of every word.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still conscious.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.998 align:middle line:84%
>> And then are you surprised
yourself when you go in those

00:44:37.998 --> 00:44:40.540 align:middle line:84%
one word at a time moments, and
then afterwards, you're like,

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.010 align:middle line:84%
oh, I actually made
a full sentence?

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.215 align:middle line:84%
>> People understood
what I said.

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> This actually went somewhere.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have these moments.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes the sentences are--

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you
would read them,

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:90%
they have 12 commas in them.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, whoa, where is
this ever going to end?

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And then it still makes sense.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, since
starting the series,

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and investigating channeling
and going into it,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and having my own
channeling experiences,

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I have the same thing.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled information,
and in my mind, I'm like,

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.350 align:middle line:84%
this is not going to
make any sense at all.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's gibberish,
what is this--

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in the moment that
you're doing it,

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.743 align:middle line:90%
because it's more of a feeling.

00:45:26.743 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You're just like, OK, I get
it, but the rest of the world,

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.610 align:middle line:90%
they can't get this.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.235 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back
and you review it,

00:45:31.235 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're like,
holy smokes, it's

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
actually using
semi-correct grammar even.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, wow,
that is incredible.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Recognizable.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So for all those watching out
there, this channeling stuff,

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.400 align:middle line:90%
there's something to it.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's funny how
sometimes I have conversations

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:84%
with people who aren't familiar
with what channeling is.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And they may think
it's just a big act.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no, you can't.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
actors who channel.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
actors do channel.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a form of channeling.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.495 align:middle line:84%
>> When you get into that
state, it just comes naturally.

00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And the better ones,
the better actors

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:84%
do get into that
channeling state.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:26.122 align:middle line:90%
But to make it up--

00:46:26.122 --> 00:46:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and I guess we are making
it up as we go along.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's the ultimate improv--

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --where you're just
completely surrendering,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.120 align:middle line:90%
whatever comes out.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But the information
that's coming out

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:84%
was not scripted and not
pre-learned dialogue.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It just comes out, and
it's quite phenomenal.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why, I think,
I felt so pulled towards

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
meditation and
emptying the mind out.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I fell in love with
that very young,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
so I started practicing
that and then the chanting,

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:90%
was a Buddhist for a while.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, Arjun just

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.080 align:middle line:84%
stepped forward and let
me know, OK, you're ready,

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.080 align:middle line:90%
let's do this if you want.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:90%
It's full surrender.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so glad you have chosen
this path to do this and share

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
the information and bring
forth these beings that we can

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.305 align:middle line:84%
hopefully soon, sooner than
later, meet face to face,

00:47:28.305 --> 00:47:30.160 align:middle line:90%
in a physical interaction.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.535 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the meantime, we
have this wonderful gift.

00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:34.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you for bringing
this out and sharing it.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for sharing it
in this way with the world--

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> This is my channel
with the cameras.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> --on an even bigger platform.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it all intertwines.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll get into some
channeling then and see where

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.440 align:middle line:90%
it goes from there.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:90%
