00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Here I would like to share
that there is a whirlwind

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of energy that is happening
on this planet at this time.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
He is mentioning that he has
been in contact with humanity

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and with myself for a number of
lifetimes, a number of years,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to spread certain
messages to humanity

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.471 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to prepare for the
time that we are in right now.

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.995 align:middle line:84%
We are currently experiencing
a time of turmoil.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
We are currently experiencing
a time of a tumultuous shift.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to get to a point where
we are ready for the shift.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We need to get to
a point where we

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
are ready to invite these
beings to our planet.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to get to a point
where we are no longer existing

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and living within
the confines of fear

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and we are completely liberated
in the trust of the universe.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
If we continue to attach
ourself to the old, traditional,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.299 align:middle line:84%
fear-based mentality
of an us versus them,

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.293 align:middle line:84%
we will never be
open enough to allow

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:90%
these beings to come through.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Elizabeth, welcome back here.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We're in this beautiful property
in Malibu with our good friend

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Buddha, and what's
his name again?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Grayson.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Grayson.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.566 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, Grayson, I
forgot your name.

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, awesome.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to
bring in some gray energy.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we are.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You're, actually, as we
were talking out yesterday,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
the other version of you.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> From the past?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so this is a past
life version of myself,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting because the
type of channeling that I do is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
usually going straight to source
energy to receive information.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really consult
a lot of spirit guides

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
or individual beings or even
my parallel versions of myself,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely
have a lot to say.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So they're very excited
to come through today.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, awesome.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And just really quick, so
your form of channeling

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.485 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit different than
some of the other channelers

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I've had on the show.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yes.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't remove
myself from my body.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'm always in full control.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just the fact
that I like to be in control.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically it's kind of
this energy of them standing

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
beside me, you asking
them a question,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm kind of the mediator.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.982 align:middle line:84%
The coolest thing is I have no
idea what they're about to say,

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and then when it
comes through, I'm

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, that's really cool.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll explain what
they say, how they explain it,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and how they show it to
me, because it's really

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
a mix of a download
of information,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.652 align:middle line:90%
and I call it a zip file.

00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like they
give me this huge download,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and then I unpack it
through verbal translation,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and then they also show
me a lot of visuals.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'll explain what that
visual looks like, and then I'll

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
explain what that
means based on what

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.977 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to talk about.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you need to do
anything special to get

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:90%
into the channeling or--

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been such an open
channel since a little girl,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I basically have the
balance or the control

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
or the structure when
my eyes are open.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm present.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:90%
I'm grounded.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.009 align:middle line:90%
I'm human.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
When my eyes are closed,
that's when my third eye opens,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and all I have to do is
kind of direct that channel

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and bring in whatever it
is that I'm curious about.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's pretty simple
to literally just snap right

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
into it and bring Heera
through, and then you

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
can go ahead and
ask him questions.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And I might have a little bit
of human commentary in between

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
of like, oh, that's really
cool, or, oh, OK, yeah,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's just basically
me listening to what he's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
explaining, and then
I'll open my eyes

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and explain exactly what that
was that he was giving me.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So in essence,
Heera's already here.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Heera's always here.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
He's always around.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they related?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, little Grayson,
yeah, he's the little son.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, perfect.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's bring in Heera.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.162 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.162 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can start with
the first question.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Start with the
first question?

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, hi, Heera.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
What is this time
we're in right now?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people classify it as
ascension, transformation,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:90%
the shift to Age of Aquarius.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:90%
There's all these labels for it.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So what, in Heera's words, is
this time we're going through

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:90%
on the planet right now?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So he gives me this image, and
the image that he gives me is--

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
the first image that he
gave me, anyway, was this,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and he gives me the
word "expansion."

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the time that
we're in is expansion.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And then he throws me
into another image, which

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
is the image of
the planet, and he

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
was showing me all of the
vortexes on the planet

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
reawakening because
there was a time where

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the vortexes
were deactivated.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.592 align:middle line:84%
And so the vortexes
are reawakening.

00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
He also brought me
all the way back

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to the time of ancient
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So he was showing me this
really hustle, bustle,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
this bustling kind
of civilization

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
during ancient
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that
this is nothing new.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are expanding.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.468 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is happening.

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's a lot
of things that are

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:90%
reactivating and opening up.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But, at the same time,
we've seen this all before.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me the word
of "rebirth, rebirth."

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
This has not the first time
this has ever happened.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This is happening again, and
he's talking about the cycles.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that he
was throwing me back

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Atlantis and
Lemuria because this

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.727 align:middle line:84%
is the last time we saw
the expansion at the point

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to get to.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not there yet.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But we're going back to those
days of Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
We've got technology and
that kind of consciousness

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and awareness and that
vibrational frequency that's

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:90%
all coming back.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So his main point, the emphasis
that he wanted to make,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:90%
is this cycle.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not new.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
We're just seeing it again.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And also he's saying,
deep down somewhere

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
within us, a lot of us, as
human beings, as souls, we've

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
been here since that time,
since Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're remembering
what we once lost.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.327 align:middle line:84%
>> What is Heera's role
in this remembering?

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask him.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
So interesting.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So he said the real question
is, what is Elizabeth April's

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:90%
role in this, because he is me.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we're here,
so he is me in this past.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But he decided it was in
that lifetime as Heera

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to come here on this
planet as a human being.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And so during that
time, we decided,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I guess as a
collective, to come down

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to this planet and this
lifetime for me, as this soul,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be the
most important lifetime

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
This is all of the
information from all

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of the lifetimes,
both terrestrial

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and non-terrestrial, are
coming back to me at this time,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm
connecting to all

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
of these cosmic and
parallel lifetimes.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to ask Heera, now,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
what he thinks my role
is on this planet?

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what does he
think your role is?

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.219 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because
we are the same.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.468 align:middle line:84%
Very short, very
sweet, and very clear,

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and he gave this to
me in a sentence.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A person-- but on
a collective role,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
a collective answer.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So to say, how do you
remind someone of who

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
they are in a general sense?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's probably
specific for each person, but--

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:09:20.232 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there a general answer?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.398 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's see.

00:09:22.398 --> 00:09:26.804 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:29.096 align:middle line:84%
Right, right, right, right,
right, right, right, right,

00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:29.896 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool, cool.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he's talking about the
difference between the body

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and the soul, and
it's a remembrance,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and it really isn't different
from person to person.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is existing in a
physical third-dimensional

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
body, and everyone has a soul
within that third-dimensional

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:90%
physical body.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the remembrance
of who you are

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
is let go of the programming.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the attachment.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Let go of the identity
and understand

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that you are so much greater
than just this person, just

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
this individual,
third-dimensional body, right?

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So the remembrance is
more at a soul level

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
than it is at a physical level.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not, hey, you were once
a shaman in a past life.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not that kind
of remembrance.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the remembrance
of we are so

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.086 align:middle line:84%
much greater than just this
moment right here, right now.

00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
What was Heera's role how
many thousands of years ago?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Roughly, more kind
of human level, I guess,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
because time's kind
of different up there,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:90%
about 500,000 years ago.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So in our interview yesterday
there was this talk of Heera

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
coming in with the Neanderthal
or Neanderthal type.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.865 align:middle line:84%
>> What specifically was Heera's
role at that time on planet

00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
He didn't-- I'll answer this,
and then I'll ask him about

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
what he can define his role as.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately he didn't really
have a role on this planet.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, his role was
how to progress his species

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
with genetic manipulation.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So let me just see what
Heera has to say about that.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:18.744 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he's talking
about his role.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
He was the ambassador for
the Grays, the Zeta Grays.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
He lived his entire
existence up on a ship.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So he said that his role in
particular in that lifetime

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
was the ambassador
for the Grays,

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and then he said he worked
in tandem with the Galactic

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Federation to help
elevate consciousness,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to help service
other species who

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe didn't have the
resources that the Grays had.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what it was
that the Grays could provide

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to the Galactic
Federation to help

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
the collective consciousness--
not on this planet,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
but as a whole within the
universe-- that's what he did.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he also mentioned
that, at a certain point

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:90%
in time, his son--

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is kind of weird
because Grays don't--

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Not this guy.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Grayson.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Grayson.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:90%
But-- so his son--

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of weird
because Grays don't really

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:90%
have children.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Grays are just clones
of one another.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
They're basically all made
in Petri dishes, in a sense,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in a laboratory.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But Heera, at that time,
made a conscious decision

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to have children or have a
son, in a sense, because he

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:90%
felt like he wanted that bond.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point in time
when his son was in relation

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to maybe around 10 years
to this kind of timelines

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, his son
ended up passing away.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
his son passed away

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
was because the genetic
manipulation went

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
so far that there was
something in the son

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:90%
was unable to be processed.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
genetic manipulation

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
that the species itself
was kind of dying out.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And so after his
son passed away,

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that's when he
got really heavily

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:90%
into genetic manipulation.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.063 align:middle line:84%
How can we save
the Gray species?

00:13:25.063 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he started
working with the Galactic

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Federation in more of a genetics
and more of a hybridization

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
That was never really his goal.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to be there for
his people as this ambassador.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
his son passing away

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and that heartbreak
and that hurt--

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
even though he understood
that a body is just a body

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can kind of implant the
same soul into another body,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't the point.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That happened so that he
could help advance the Grays

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and, essentially, eventually
help advance human beings, as

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:84%
well, within our own
genetic genome as well.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So was he maybe one of the
ones responsible for bringing

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that up to the
Federation to say, hey,

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
our species is in trouble, we
need to find some DNA to help

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
us out, and Earth
was a match for that?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't him who even
brought up Earth as a match.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the Galactic
Federation that said,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
actually, there
is a peace treaty

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that is happening on this planet
called Earth, even though they

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
don't call it Earth, and this
peace treaty is basically

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
this prophecy where all of
these different interdimensional

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
beings from all
over the universe

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
come together, genetically
splice their DNA with the DNA

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of these Neanderthals to
help advance us, in a sense,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
but really just to
kind of all get along

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
out there in the universe.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Galactic
Federation was like, this

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:90%
is kind of perfect timing.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
We also need you,
as well, a part

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
of this prophecy and
this peace treaty.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So for the
Federation, is it--

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
so would he just sort
of make a phone call,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
like a telepathic phone call
to the Federation and say--

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
like our government leaders
would call on the red phone

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:90%
to Russia.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got a problem,
and let's negotiate,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and let's figure
something out here,

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and how can we work together
to solve this issue?

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's two
ways to mainly contact.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:90%
One is teleportation.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
So there's like a hub.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to call it--

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a train
station, and you

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
can teleport into the
Galactic Federation spaceship

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.675 align:middle line:90%
from any spaceship.

00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
all across the universe,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but you can be quite a
distance and just teleport in.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.788 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
hologram projectors, as well,

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:90%
within the Galactic Federation.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And they've shown me a
lot of holograms, which

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I thought was pretty cool.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like in "Star Wars"
where R2-D2 does the thing.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly like that.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.933 align:middle line:84%
>> And everybody's
sitting around, like, oh,

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
we got a distress signal
coming from Earth.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's go in and--

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really wild how close
some movies really do have it--

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Really do that.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.575 align:middle line:90%
>> --what's going on out there.

00:16:02.575 --> 00:16:03.375 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that leads me to
my next question, which was,

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
what is the Galactic Federation?

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So we've heard terms
and ideas about it.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.947 align:middle line:84%
In Heera's terms, what is
the Galactic Federation?

00:16:19.947 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see what he has to say.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, he's giving
me very specific words.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's an intuitively
structured system

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
to organize the chaos
of the universe.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting a huge
emphasis on "intuitive,"

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
and he was explaining that--

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.968 align:middle line:90%
and this is really cool.

00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably
the biggest difference

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
between our government
system and theirs.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
He was explaining that every
position within the Galactic

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Federation is chosen
for the person based

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:90%
on their vibrational frequency.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the vibration
very logical, analytical, very

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
good at problem solving,
you're going be an engineer.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:84%
If you really love
technology, you're

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be working
on the circuit boards.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.753 align:middle line:84%
If you're really good at
nurturing and kindness

00:17:14.753 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and compassion,
you're going to be

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
working with the hybrids,
the hybrid children,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:90%
or in the nursery.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has a position
that is finely tuned

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to their vibration,
and he is reminding me

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's very similar to what
we had back in ancient Greece,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe, with the
philosopher kings and the fact

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't necessarily
a caste system that puts you

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
into a position, but it was
your skills and abilities that

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:90%
put you into that position.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Skills can be sort
of learned in a sense.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.017 align:middle line:90%
If I wanted--

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I guess, what am I
trying to say here?

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.058 align:middle line:84%
The question I'm
trying to ask is--

00:17:50.058 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, I'm a
skilled martial artist.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I've trained.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:90%
I've done the work.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I can do martial arts.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Right now, my interest is more
in doing this kind of work,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and I'm growing those skills.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
How would the Federation
handle something like that?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
What if someone had the skills
to work on circuit boards

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
but had the interest
to do something else?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So from an early age,
based on your skills,

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a variety of
testing that you go through,

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.782 align:middle line:84%
and there's school and stuff
like that up there as well.

00:18:22.782 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And so once you go through
the testing, they're like,

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.908 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is what you're
going to be good at.

00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're fine tuned.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:84%
This is your ideal state
of working position.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go
into that position

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, OK,
that doesn't really

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
align with me anymore, it's
not exciting me, then you

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:84%
can go back to the
Galactic Federation,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
go back to the council members
and let them know that,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and they will actually put
you into a better suited

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:84%
position based on where
you're at at that time.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.965 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you're not forced into
anything you don't want to do.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.507 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not necessarily forced
into anything you don't want

00:18:55.507 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is the best based on
your vibrational frequency.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, it's
most likely something

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that you really enjoy
doing because that's

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:90%
what you're really good at.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you shift into
some other interests,

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
most likely your frequency,
your vibration's also going

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to shift, so they would go
according to that as opposed

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead of-- yeah, cool.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
In the Federation,
do they have--

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
in our "Star Trek" lore, we
have the prime directive where--

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%
are you familiar?

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you watch?

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you a "Star Trek" fan?

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.702 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OH.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's OK though.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Even better.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got my own "Star Trek."

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.175 align:middle line:90%
It's probably better.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's probably better.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the "Star Trek" lore,
there's the prime directive

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
where a non-space-bearing planet
is not allowed to be interfered

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%
with in their
evolutionary stage.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure Gene Roddenberry
and the creator of "Star Trek"

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
were probably channeling or
having some kind of contact

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:90%
information for that.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:90%
We've heard from others.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about this in
different forms and fashions.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:90%
And wondering what Heera's--

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
his idea of the prime
directive and how that works

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and if he could help
define that a little bit.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, perfect.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:12.607 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's take a look.

00:20:12.607 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he doesn't necessarily
know what prime directive is,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:84%
but he is mentioning
that there are

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
laws within the universe
that are not necessarily laws

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Galactic Federation has
created, but they do abide by,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and he was explaining that
these laws, once again, are not

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
created by one species,
one being, one force.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:90%
These are universal laws.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So the law of binary, the
laws of ones and zeros,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the laws of binary is the
laws of opposites, right?

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He was also talking about
the law of non-intervention,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's pretty much what
you were talking about,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and that's the same thing.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:90%
So when-- how do I say this?

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
If a soul or a consciousness
does not ask for help,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
there is no intervention
that can be had at that time.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So any species across
the entire universe

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
has to abide by these
certain universal truths

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
or universal laws.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is just the role
of the Galactic Federation

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that comes in and basically
oversees those laws.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the Galactic
Federation laws.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the laws of the universe.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
about the laws

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
of the universe are to ensure
the harmony of the universe.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In our human lore, as
far as when it comes to ETs

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and especially Grays, there's
a lot of ideas around abduction

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and people taken against their
will aboard ships with genetic

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.925 align:middle line:84%
material taken, which
you'd already mentioned

00:22:01.925 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
the hybridization programs,
which we'll get into a little

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:90%
bit later.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But what does Heera have
to say about that idea--

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Abductions.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the abductions, and
how is it related to this

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:90%
noninterference law?

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good question.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's a
lot going on here.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.895 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of facets to this.

00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
that he brought up

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and he was showing me these--

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
he was showing me
a couple of things.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.068 align:middle line:84%
One was the abductions
themselves on this planet,

00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and then he was also showing
me the Galactic Federation

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
ship and all of the
beings on the ship.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
There is an approval
process that

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
needs to kind of take place,
not just from the Galactic

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Federation because,
ultimately, it comes down

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:90%
to that individual soul.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
That soul has to sign up
for and volunteer themselves

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:90%
for the hybridization program.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
No one, no one being,
no one species,

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is allowed to
override the contracts

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and to override the free
will of another being.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:84%
That is probably the
of nonintervention

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest law out
there in the universe.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So Heera was talking
about not only

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
are individual souls on this
planet choosing to sign up

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
for these abduction
experiences, they're

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:84%
volunteering to
have that experience

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and to be a part
of that program.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that, there's
the approval process of any

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
being, any species, that wants
to interact with humanity,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
with this planet, or really
any other terrestrial

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
or non-terrestrial planet has
to kind of bring it across the--

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
bring it by, I guess,
the Galactic Federation.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, Heera was also talking
about some nefarious

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
or malevolent
beings-- so basically

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the lower vibrational ones,
the service to self beings.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:84%
They find loopholes
in the system.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the importance
of the Galactic Federation

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
comes into play
is to kind of put

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
a stop to a lot
of these loopholes

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
or the manipulation
of the system.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing that Heera
was talking about is--

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
this is convoluted,
but he was saying

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that certain beings, low
vibrational service to self

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:84%
beings, are able to
manipulate an individual soul

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
on this planet so that they
actually ask to be taken.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, when they
ask to be taken or they're OK

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and they accept the terms
of the agreement-- maybe

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that's a dream that was set up,
maybe that was a fear tactic,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and then there's certain
abductions and things

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that happen with the
beings that are service

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
to self because they've found
that loophole in the system,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and they get that individual's
permission, in a sense,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
but working with fear to kind
of get that person's permission.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's corruption.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There's corruption
out there just

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
as much as there's
corruption down here.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's kind
of like a cult.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they start
off with good intentions.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
They use the buzz words "love
and light" to get everybody in,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and then, before
you know it, you're

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of giving all
your power away

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to this one person
or this group,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.777 align:middle line:84%
and then they got
you, all your money.

00:25:32.777 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:90%
They got your house.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:90%
They got your mortgage.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we have some cults
here in LA that do that,

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.685 align:middle line:90%
and we won't even go into that.

00:25:42.685 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, it sounds
like there are loopholes

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:90%
to sign your life away.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But what Heer's saying is
initially in these programs

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
when they were set up, the
hybridization programs,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the borrowing of DNA, I'll say,
or the extraction of DNA is all

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%
done prior to incarnation--

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --and with permission.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are the
hybridization programs from

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Heera's perspective?

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

00:26:16.422 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, fantastic.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.683 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's a lot
of information here,

00:26:21.683 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
different varying degrees

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:90%
of the hybridization program.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So Heera was first talking
about the initial hybridization

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
program that was happening on
the Galactic Federation ships.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So this was happening long
before any hybridization

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
program that was
here on this planet.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic
Federation, the GFL,

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
was already working with a
lot of different gene splicing

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and collaborations
between different species.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Heera was saying that
the strongest individual,

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the strongest species
that we can get to

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
is the mixing of all of the DNA,
because if you think about all

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of these strengths and all of
the exposure to a lot of the--

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a
bacteria, whether it

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
be some sort of disease
in another species.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You mix the genome,
and you come up

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
with this super being
who's able to override

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that typical
kind of genetic--

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Weakness.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the weaknesses
within those individual genes.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying that that
was already in play long

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
before the hybridization project
that the Grays got involved

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he was talking
about, specifically

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
with the passing away
of his son and getting

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
involved with this
hybrid program,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:84%
it was great because the
Grays are genetic specialists.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
They are specifically attuned
and really well versed

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:90%
in genetics.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They have been splicing
their own genes,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and they have been advancing
their own civilization

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and biology for tens
of thousands of years,

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:90%
probably millions of years.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And so they're experts.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:90%
They're genetic experts.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when Heera went to
the Galactic Federation

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and they came on board
with the GFL and said,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.710 align:middle line:84%
hey, we want to help
evolve our species

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and we want to help
in whatever way we can

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:84%
for the collective, that's when
the Galactic Federation was

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
like, we could really
use your help with this.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then they came and
involved with the Galactic

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Federation, and it
was only after a lot

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
of other kind of
genetic splicing

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and other hybrids were created
where the humans kind of came

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
into play with that, and
the Galactic Federation

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
asked the Grays to kind
of help us also evolve

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:90%
the human species as well.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.648 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like the
Zetas, or the Grays--

00:28:47.648 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I can say Zeta, right--
from Zeta Reticuli.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:49.903 align:middle line:90%
>> You can say Zeta.

00:28:49.903 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I know there's many
different species,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:84%
different types of
Grays, I should say.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.252 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the past you
said, he's a tall Gray.

00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So what's the difference
between the tall Grays

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and the short Grays?

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's see.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, OK, so it's kind
of two different things

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that he wants to bring up here.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The first one is there's a
lot of different gray beings

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
who have been planted
all across this universe,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and depending on the environment
and the different variables,

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
they developed in
different ways,

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and also depending on the
environment and the variables

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and the wars and what
have you, they also

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
developed emotionally,
energetically,

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
consciously in a
different way as well

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:90%
with different vibrations.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
His species in particular
he's talking about

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:84%
came from Sirius,
Sirius Planet B,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and he does call
himself Zeta as well.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So maybe even further back
he comes from Zeta Reticuli.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.318 align:middle line:84%
But he lived all of his
lifetime on a spaceship.

00:29:57.318 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So even though that's
his background,

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's kind of--

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
know he was on the mothership
of the Grays in that sense.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of difficult
to differentiate

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:90%
each gray category.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> His species in particular
looks very typical to Grays,

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
very much like Grayson.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Grayson, all right.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then he said, within the
species onboard the mothership

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that he is in control of, or
was in control of in a sense,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:84%
there are three different
types of Grays--

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%
short Grays-- they're between
3 feet and 4 feet tall--

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and then medium-height
Grays, which

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
are anywhere between 5
feet and 6 feet tall,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and then the tall Grays, which
are typically 7 or 8 feet tall.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that tall?

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:40.635 --> 00:30:41.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, OK.

00:30:41.435 --> 00:30:43.133 align:middle line:90%
>> And so I asked him--

00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:84%
when I was just
chatting with him,

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.577 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why the
difference in the heights?

00:30:47.577 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is really cool because
I've never heard this from him

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But he said, there's
literally no other way

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to differentiate the Grays
in their physical appearance

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
other than the height.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.408 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, well,
one has really big ears.

00:31:01.408 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
No, none of them have
ears, you know what I mean?

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's-- now they're
just down to a very limited

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
kind of genetic makeup
to really change.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then he goes
into the different roles

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:90%
of each height of each Gray.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So the short Grays
are a little bit more

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
like biological
robots in a sense.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:90%
They're very technical driven.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
They're very simplistic.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can consider
their vibration

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
as younger souls in a
sense, even though there's

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as really
young or old souls,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:84%
but they're just a little bit
more straightforward right.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You give them a task, and
they go ahead and do it,

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's very straightforward.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:84%
The medium-height Grays
are basically like--

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:90%
he calls them the managers.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of oversee
mostly the short Grays.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But they also get put
into more advanced roles

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:84%
of within the
engineering department

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
they will be that the leader
of that department or they'll

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
oversee that kind of
department or what have you.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're a little
bit more advanced.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:84%
They're also a lot
more emotional.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So when the abductions
happen, it's usually

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
the short, little Grays
who pick up the people,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're usually
much more robotic.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So even at a vibrational
sense, if the short Grays

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:84%
were to abduct someone who is
very intuitive and empathic,

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
they would not really feel
that emotional connection

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.360 align:middle line:84%
with the short, little Grays,
whereas the taller grays are

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:90%
much more emotionally--

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
they've got this emotional
intelligence to them.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
They've got a wide spectrum.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the tallest Grays, the
tall Grays, are the leaders--

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and once again, the
leaders of each section

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of community.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him if
the height had anything

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to do with their awareness level
or is it taller, a bigger body,

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:84%
you've got more capacity
to fit more in there?

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, not at all.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the
height is specifically

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
for the distinction between the
roles onboard the spaceships.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And there has been moments
where short Grays have said,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I don't feel
like this is a position for me,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
especially the short Grays who
are freethinkers in a way that

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
they think beyond the horde,
beyond the collective.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, I don't
know, that's not really me,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and then they get put
into a position that

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is a higher ranking even though
they're in a shorter body.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's also possible.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Same sort of thing.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like a uniform when
we have in military uniforms--

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
there are different governmental
uniforms that have different

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
insignias or colors to
distinguish the roles.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So their bodies, in
a sense, is a uniform--

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, yeah.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --for the role.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.753 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a lot of
abduction scenarios, too,

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:42.795 align:middle line:90%
or temporary detainment--

00:33:42.795 --> 00:33:45.012 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to shift
over to that word more.

00:33:45.012 --> 00:33:45.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:45.845 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:90%
That's better.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people report on
being with the little guys

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and then going on the ship,
and over in the corner,

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a tall dude
sitting in the room--

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Overseeing.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --overseeing or connecting,
and they could feel more

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:90%
emotions coming from that one--

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, cool.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> --that love or
something more connect--

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:84%
more connectivity
to that one being

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.439 align:middle line:84%
in the room as opposed
to all the little guys.

00:34:10.439 --> 00:34:11.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally makes sense.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's sort of that
lineage of Heera's gray world,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
There are other
Grays that we hear

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
about that really have nefarious
roles or nefarious agendas.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these the ones that
we're hearing about that slipped

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
through the cracks and sort
of are able to manipulate

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
the current system a
little bit and do things?

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.783 align:middle line:84%
How does the Galactic
Federation deal

00:34:47.783 --> 00:34:48.950 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of situation?

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good question.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:90%


00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot within that.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's just two things
that he really wants to mention.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.320 align:middle line:84%
One is, honestly, the
Galactic Federation just

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
does the best that they
can with those situations,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
difficult, and he brought up

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:90%
the nonintervention as well.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So here are these
nefarious beings

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%
who are not overriding these
contracts, not necessarily--

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:90%
just manipulating the system.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So if they're manipulating the
system because they understand

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.090 align:middle line:84%
the system, then the
Galactic Federation

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:84%
can't swoop in and
override their free will

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and their contracts.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic
Federation is basically

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:90%
abiding by all of the rules.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:84%
The nefarious ones are
manipulating the rules.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Galactic Federation
still has to abide by the rules

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
even when it comes down to the
nefarious because, once again,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing
anything wrong,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and if they were
to be overriding

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
freewill and overriding
those kind of contracts,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:90%
then the GFL could step in.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But, unfortunately,
because they're just

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:84%
skewing things and
manipulating things,

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
there really isn't a
whole lot that the GFL

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:90%
can do in those situations.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as Heera, he said
he doesn't really interact

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.682 align:middle line:90%
with those beings whatsoever.

00:36:11.682 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Even though they look
very similar because they

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of all come from
the same genetic makeup,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
they're very extremely
different vibrationally.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
He also wanted to mention
that the short, little Grays--

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and he says that it's a fear
tactic or a control system,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:84%
especially on this planet, that
certain short Grays that aren't

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the ones who work
with him or the GFL

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.740 align:middle line:84%
are these biological
robots in the sense

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that there are powers
that be or other beings,

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:84%
such as the Draconians
or the Annunaki, who

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are able to basically remote
control these short Grays

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to wreak havoc and to
create a lot of fear

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
within society to make
people, human beings,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.830 align:middle line:90%
believe that the Grays are bad.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He's also bringing
up a situation

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that came to my
attention years ago,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:90%
maybe five or six years ago.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I was called to
Peru vibrationally,

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
was the shamans--

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's certain
shamans in Peru

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
shape shifters.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's really wild because
these shape shifters are

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:84%
going-- they're really
Draconian or Reptilian,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
but they're going from the
human form into the Gray form

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
after doing a lot of
very nefarious acts

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:84%
towards humanity
and human beings,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to make the humans
think that it's

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the Grays who are the ones
who are doing these things.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite wild
how much they push

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to switch the agenda so
that people, human beings,

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:90%
are so fearful of Grays.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
I think that there

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:84%
is this fearful, gray-based
agenda because ultimately we're

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
entering into this era
of the next hybrids,

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the next evolution of humanity,
which is half gray, half human.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.073 align:middle line:84%
So if humanity's
really scared of Grays,

00:38:09.073 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
there's no way
they're never, ever

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be open to allowing
these half gray, half humans

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:84%
into this civilization,
and that's

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.620 align:middle line:84%
why that fear tactic
has been pushed,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.143 align:middle line:84%
this fear agenda has been pushed
to such an extreme extent.

00:38:22.143 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's
kind of a distraction.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Hey, look over here.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Reptilians over here.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Grays over here.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
But look over here.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.810 align:middle line:90%
These are the guys.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.893 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones you've
got to be worried about.

00:38:30.893 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
part of my purpose

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
for being here as
well, just as a human,

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is to switch around people's
perspective of the Grays.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.667 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think I'm Pleiadian,

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:84%
maybe because they think
I'm a pretty human,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.833 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately I'm one of
those weird dudes who's, like,

00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
8 feet tall, and I think it's
a cruel joke from the universe

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that they put me into
this 5 foot nothing body.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.608 align:middle line:84%
I've got a little bit
of a short complex,

00:38:52.608 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:90%
but I'm getting over it.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Anyways-- yeah.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool, cool.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, a short disclaimer
because I've had

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
some awesome Reptilians
on the show, too--

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.535 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not all
the Reptilians are bad,

00:39:04.535 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and not all the
Annunaki are bad.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:06.470 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.803 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've spoken to a lot
of Reptilians who are great,

00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and they helped
me disable bases,

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:90%
and they're also fantastic.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I always say, there's good
and bad in every species.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's super important.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Grays, Reptilians,
Annunaki-- I've

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:84%
met a lot of really
great Annunakis as well.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, for sure.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, perfect.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So with getting back to
the hybridization programs,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:84%
we have Heera obviously
is a major role

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in this as far as asking the
permission for the Galactic

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Federation or helping
broker that deal,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.040 align:middle line:84%
if that's the way to
say it, broker the deal.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about-- what's
happening there currently?

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We've had-- we know from the
'70s, '60s, late '60s to really

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the late '90s, even early
2000s, a lot of genetic material

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.790 align:middle line:90%
was collected.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:84%
We've talked in past
shows about the hybrids.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
What's Heera's role
in all of this?

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.985 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of set up
the idea of the hybrids.

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to go
into that too much.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:17.305 align:middle line:84%
>> But really, what is
Heera's current role in this

00:40:17.305 --> 00:40:20.260 align:middle line:90%
hybridization program?

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So Heera, even
though his body had

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
passed, as just a consciousness,
as that parallel version

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.390 align:middle line:84%
of that being with
all of the knowledge

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that he had with
the hybrid project,

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:84%
he has been a part
of the hybrid project

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
basically since his incarnation
as Heera, as that ambassador.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So he's now been working
with the Galactic Federation

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of Light even without
the physical presence

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:90%
of being there.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, just the consciousness.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the consciousness
has been there ever since.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So he said his role has changed
a lot throughout the years.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.690 align:middle line:84%
He's overseen a lot of different
aspects of the project.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
years ago, he was

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.490 align:middle line:84%
talking about trying to get hair
on the heads of these hybrids

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and how difficult
it was to just get

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:90%
the hair in the right places--

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.110 align:middle line:84%
so patch of hair here,
patch of hair here.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh jeez.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the hair was
probably the biggest issue

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.560 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:90%
That's hilarious.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But currently what he's
doing-- this is really cool.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:84%
He is currently working on
the setup and the integration

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.600 align:middle line:84%
with the hybrids coming
into planet Earth.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes he oversees some
of the testing and the training.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I call it Earth school
that's going on up

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:90%
there on this giant mothership.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And so these hybrids are
being trained and tested

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.710 align:middle line:90%
to come to this planet.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, he's really
figuring out all of the kinks

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and all of the issues
that are arising with--

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, how do we get the
hybrids to planet Earth?

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we get planet Earth to
accept these hybrid children?

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:84%
How do we get these
children to be more human?

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So he's working on a lot
of the more emotional,

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:13.450 align:middle line:84%
the more social issues that are
arising with the integration

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:84%
process of actually
bringing the hybrids

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.840 align:middle line:84%
to this planet and the issues
that arise around that.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some
of those issues?

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.775 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's see.

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, ultimately, the
biggest issue-- and he's

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.700 align:middle line:84%
showing me this image of
this beautiful hybrid child,

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I think a gen two,
gen two hybrid.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say that he would be
around maybe 18, 19 years old

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in Earth years, I
guess, in a sense--

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.790 align:middle line:84%
male-looking human,
but very gray.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of difficult to
explain what they look like--

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:84%
more pointed jawline, much
bigger eyes, a smaller nose,

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
but still a nose, little
ears, and some hair,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.740 align:middle line:90%
some tufts of hair.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We've got that down.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got some
hair down there.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It was great.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Anyway, so he's saying that
one of the biggest issues is

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:84%
the us versus them mentality
that's on this planet.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
issues is humans

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:84%
accepting the next evolutionary
step right as humans.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But because they look
different enough,

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
difficult for human beings

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to be open enough to allow
them to come into society.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the other issue
that they're really

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.835 align:middle line:84%
struggling with right
now is all of the--

00:43:31.835 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:84%
so there's about three
generations of hybrids

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.340 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Would this be just--
sorry to interrupt,

00:43:36.132 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:84%
but would this be in our
future right now, near future,

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:90%
like this us versus--

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Currently, right now, we
definitely have an us versus

00:43:43.303 --> 00:43:44.510 align:middle line:90%
them mentality.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have hybrids trying
to integrate into this reality

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:48.710 align:middle line:90%
just yet.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.930 align:middle line:90%
We know it's around the corner.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So is this in the
future a little bit?

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so we're talking
about 30 to 50 years from now

00:43:56.143 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
an integration.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.335 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and some of the
issues that could arise

00:44:01.335 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
on the timeline we're
dealing with now.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, even 30
to 50 years from now,

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.810 align:middle line:84%
what do we need to
do, how do we need

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.490 align:middle line:84%
to plant within society to
allow humans to open up?

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Right now about now we
have wars over Muslims

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:84%
because they have a
different culture.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:17.330 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous, you know?

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, we got to get
going on this whole awakening

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.330 align:middle line:90%
thing, you know?

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And so-- yeah, the
integration, they're

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:84%
having a bit of an
issue with that.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that they're
having an issue with is--

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
there's two main issues,
two other main issues.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.100 align:middle line:84%
One is the
third-generational hybrids--

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.560 align:middle line:84%
no, the first-generational
hybrids on the ships right.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:90%
They're the oldest.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They are so done
with planet Earth.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.920 align:middle line:84%
They do not want
to come down here.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're like, you
want us to come down there

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:84%
when it's really dense,
when there's a lot of fear,

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:84%
when there's a
lot of projection?

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So the third generation,
the youngest ones, they're

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:90%
very excited.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.878 align:middle line:84%
They're still very excited
to come here, right?

00:45:00.878 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:84%
They're like, we want to help
humanity and help the humans.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's great.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.145 align:middle line:84%
So we're having
a bit of an issue

00:45:06.145 --> 00:45:09.452 align:middle line:84%
with the first-generational,
first-gen hybrids.

00:45:09.452 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit of
an issue, but more

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.708 align:middle line:90%
of a behavioral kind of issue.

00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't want to come
down here, they don't have to.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not obligated.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the other issue that
they're encountering is--

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is the biggest
issue right now is

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
all of these hybrid
children who are being born

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:84%
onboard those ships are more
gray than they are human.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional
intelligence aspect

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of it, their understanding
of human emotions

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.360 align:middle line:90%
is extremely difficult.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:90%
They don't get the reaction.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
the attachment.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
the violence

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and the abuse and the--

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're not supposed
to be exactly human.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But they are very, very removed
from the human emotions,

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're much more logical,
analytical, they're much more--

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.700 align:middle line:90%
yeah, very high IQs.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.830 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
to the gray spectrum

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:84%
than the human spectrum
because they're not

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.230 align:middle line:84%
having as much interaction
and involvement

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
with humans as
they need to have,

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're not having as much
connection and and interaction

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.430 align:middle line:84%
with their mothers, as
well, the human mothers.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
disconnect from them

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to human beings at
this point in time

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't that
very natural nurturing

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.180 align:middle line:90%
that takes place.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> When they were creating
these first generation,

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.920 align:middle line:84%
second generation, third
generation, was the intention,

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:42.150 align:middle line:84%
the original intention, for
first generation to be contact

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
specialists or to
interact with us?

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Did they realize it was
going to take this long?

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Did they know?

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I guess the follow-up
question right after that would

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.760 align:middle line:84%
be, did the hybridists
themselves coming

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:84%
into incarnation, as first
generation, did they--

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they aware?

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they expecting that they
were supposed to come down here

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and interact with
this us on Earth?

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.360 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of things here--

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:19.420 align:middle line:84%
so he brought up the words
"mutually beneficial."

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:84%
The hybrid, specifically--
because there's a lot

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of hybrids-- but specifically
the Essassani hybrids,

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the half human, half gray, they
were meant to mutually benefit

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.118 align:middle line:84%
both the Grays for
their advancement--

00:47:32.118 --> 00:47:34.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of things
that they have kind of missed

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:84%
out on in their
genetic evolution--

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and then, also, obviously,
to be beneficial to humanity,

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, in helping
us evolve and get

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.595 align:middle line:90%
to that next vibrational level.

00:47:46.595 --> 00:47:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was all planned
through the Galactic Federation.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.460 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't even the Grays'
plan, but, once again,

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that mutually beneficial kind
of energy between the two.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So he said that, and
then he also mentioned--

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.440 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So every soul that was
incarnated into these hybrids

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:90%
were very aware of the plan.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They were very aware of
coming down to this planet.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
maybe necessarily planned

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.850 align:middle line:84%
for the first-gen hybrids
to come to this planet.

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of more
of an experiment.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The second-gen,
third-gen hybrids,

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
yes, they are planning
to come to this planet,

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
schooling and things

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that are up there on that ship
that they're going through

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to prepare
themselves to be here.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're very aware of that.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They've contracted their
souls to be here as well.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked
him if there was

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:43.510 align:middle line:84%
anything that they
didn't plan for

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
or anything that kind of not
got screwed up, but anything

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:90%
that was--

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:48.395 align:middle line:90%
>> A wrench in the system.

00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> A wrench in the system.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Besides the hair.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, besides the hair.

00:48:51.153 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:90%
That was a tricky one, for sure.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.410 align:middle line:90%
But he said that it was--

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.550 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, the timing.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So timelines have
been pushed back.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It should have been
a little bit sooner

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.688 align:middle line:90%
than what it is right now.

00:49:06.688 --> 00:49:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of timelines.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.090 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite number
of parallel realities

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that could potentially
happen, and planning

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.430 align:middle line:84%
for all of the infinite parallel
realities is a little much.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of plan for
the most likely to occur.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But the pushback
from the powers that

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
be or the pushback from
the low-vibrational beings

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.670 align:middle line:84%
on this planet who want to
keep us in their control

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.940 align:middle line:84%
has been very intense,
and humans haven't really

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.670 align:middle line:84%
allowed themselves to let go
of that paradigm of control

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:36.070 align:middle line:90%
quite yet, as a whole anyway.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:90%
So yeah-- so the timelines.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a very significant
timeline he brought up in 2017.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.930 align:middle line:84%
That was actually
supposed to be the 2020

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:90%
timeline that we're seeing now.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So the vibration that we're
moving into for 2020 really

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:84%
opening up, entering into
that higher vibrational

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.620 align:middle line:84%
stage and that conscious
awareness, more

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:01.785 align:middle line:84%
love all around, that was
supposed to be back in 2017.

00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
lot of information

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that I was receiving
back in 2016,

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:84%
2017 gearing
everyone up for that,

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and then they told me that
timelines got pushed back

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:84%
back then, and he
just reminded me

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that the timelines have been a
little bit difficult for them

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.190 align:middle line:90%
to kind of fully harness.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the reality on the
ships and these hybrids,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.500 align:middle line:84%
time doesn't quite work
the way it does here.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:90%
So for them, does a--

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:84%
for us from 2017 to 2020,
three years goes by.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.207 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff happens.

00:50:37.207 --> 00:50:38.290 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel for them?

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it three years on the
ship or is it two days?

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it five days?

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let me ask him.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:53.830 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:55.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, so yeah.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So time definitely works
quite differently up there.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Hybrids themselves as well
as Grays live a lot longer.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So Grays, in their entirety,
live about 600 Earth years.

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, OK.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The hybrids can
live up to 200--

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:17.260 align:middle line:90%
yeah, probably 150 to 200 years.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.540 align:middle line:90%
But time up there on the ships--

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And the word that he
used was it drones on.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It just drones on.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It drones on.

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It drones on.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.575 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if that's like a--

00:51:28.575 --> 00:51:29.775 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he--

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a "Star Wars"
drone type of drone?

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps going,
and so there's really

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.730 align:middle line:84%
no differentiation between
the days and the nights

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.890 align:middle line:90%
as we do have here, you know?

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just a spaceship's a
spaceship's a spaceship.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're in the front of
the spaceship at the control

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.950 align:middle line:84%
room, you don't really even
see space most of the time.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.570 align:middle line:90%
You're just indoors.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And so he said that
for the hybrids

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:84%
it feels like time
goes a lot slower.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's maybe not
necessarily the case.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just because there's
no differentiation.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.390 align:middle line:84%
He said that there are
levels of achievement,

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:14.428 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they progress
through the schooling system.

00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like every year that
they go through the schooling

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.970 align:middle line:84%
system, there's another
level of achievement

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that they kind of go through
and they're awarded--

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, grade one, grade two
kind of thing, right?

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's levels
of achievement,

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and that helps the hybrids, at
least, have some sort of target

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:36.085 align:middle line:84%
or they're very excited
about kind of moving forward

00:52:36.085 --> 00:52:37.960 align:middle line:84%
through that schooling
system because there's

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.400 align:middle line:90%
something to look forward to.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like the progression.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.060 align:middle line:84%
There's really not a
whole lot of awareness

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of progression
throughout the days

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.630 align:middle line:84%
or the weeks or the months,
let alone just schooling

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:50.430 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just on and on and on.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So in their
monitoring our timelines,

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in their looking at us and our
evolution and how we're going

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.650 align:middle line:84%
through this, how
do they gauge that,

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:84%
or are they looking at all
possibilities and are there

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:11.230 align:middle line:84%
versions of them, the type ones
or the type twos, for example,

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
already interacting with
us on a different timeline,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.920 align:middle line:90%
2019 timeline version?

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.275 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking at all
those possibilities?

00:53:20.275 --> 00:53:21.400 align:middle line:90%
How does that kind of work?

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.783 align:middle line:84%
I know it's probably a
little complicated for our--

00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a little convoluted.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, let's
take a look here.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.547 align:middle line:84%
>> --minds to fully
understand at this moment.

00:53:27.547 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.665 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so a lot of it is
basically a waiting game is

00:53:35.665 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:84%
what he kind of
mentioned, right?

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So he's also said that there's
a control room for that.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's actually this
control room where there's

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.025 align:middle line:84%
specialists, and
this is definitely

00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
not what he specialized
in, but there's

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:50.930 align:middle line:84%
specialists who look at all
of the different parallel

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:53.270 align:middle line:90%
realities moving forward.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.885 align:middle line:84%
And they don't look at all
of them because it's a lot.

00:53:55.885 --> 00:53:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
they can't really

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
influence things because, if
it's not in the contracts,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.870 align:middle line:84%
if it's not kind of
planned and agreed

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.660 align:middle line:84%
upon consciously
by both parties,

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.223 align:middle line:90%
it's really just a waiting game.

00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's sitting back and
observing a lot and saying,

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.060 align:middle line:84%
oh, OK, we're now
in this timeline.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, fantastic.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.810 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have to
do based on this timeline.

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.780 align:middle line:84%
If anything major really
shifts within those parallel

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.937 align:middle line:84%
timelines, they will then
talk to another counsel

00:54:20.937 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:84%
within the Galactic
Federation to say,

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.740 align:middle line:84%
hey, there was a huge
bump that happened.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.850 align:middle line:90%
There was a huge shift.

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Things like nuclear weapons
being released, tsunamis,

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:84%
what have you, other kind of
technology that humans have

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that they use against
humanity, they

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.090 align:middle line:84%
alert because that's
a very clear hop

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.130 align:middle line:90%
into another timeline.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:84%
President Trump getting elected,
that's a timeline, right?

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.215 align:middle line:90%
>> And so-- yeah.

00:54:48.215 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So with all those
timelines, when the timeline

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:84%
passes the mark that, OK, now
we're in the present moment

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.928 align:middle line:84%
and that could have happened but
it didn't, they don't go back.

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't really--
oh, well, there's

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.930 align:middle line:84%
a parallel timeline where we
are interacting with them.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It's already passed.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.590 align:middle line:84%
They want to be as efficient
and effective as possible.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:08.810 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to look at.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Why look at things that
could have happened

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:84%
when we can look forward and
see what could potentially

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:16.080 align:middle line:90%
happen in the next step, right?

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So yeah-- so it's really cool.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So they have got
this control room

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.727 align:middle line:84%
and all these
different beings who

00:55:20.727 --> 00:55:24.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of focus on Earth in
particular and the timelines

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.920 align:middle line:90%
within Earth.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But, once again, there's
not a whole lot of control

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.010 align:middle line:90%
that they have with that.

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, humanity, the
collective consciousness

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:34.140 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, is ultimately in
control of the timelines moving

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.940 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're just looking at
the potentials moving forward,

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.240 align:middle line:90%
not back.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The potentials moving forward
and how to mitigate them,

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.100 align:middle line:84%
how to work with them, how
to integrate with them,

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.980 align:middle line:84%
when the time is right, when
the hybrids are meant to come

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:90%
to this planet.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's done is done.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's done is done.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of in our timeline.

00:55:50.595 --> 00:55:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> In our timeline.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Our interaction with
them in this timeline,

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:84%
they're just focused on
the future, so to say,

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:90%
or potentials.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool, that makes sense.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:55:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Good to know that.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.770 align:middle line:84%
With that said,
how's it looking?

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:05.710 align:middle line:90%
How does it look for--

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --on this timeline
currently to--

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure I've asked
this question in the past,

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure it changes
every day, obviously knowing

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.785 align:middle line:84%
that no expectations,
that all the variables

00:56:19.785 --> 00:56:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and different things.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:90%
But for now--

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> As a whole.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> As of whole.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.410 align:middle line:90%
We're in 2019.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:90%
2020 is around the corner.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.910 align:middle line:84%
How does it look
for us interacting

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.890 align:middle line:90%
with our hybrid friends?

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's take a look.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:40.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he can't say too much
because it will and always does

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.290 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But he said absolutely right
now looking really good.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We are in a really
good timeline.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We're in a really good
projection moving forward.

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
He said that cosmic disclosure
is happening at this time

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.100 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet, whether
that be at an individual level

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:01.740 align:middle line:84%
or to a group of people, but
not at a global scale quite yet.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.032 align:middle line:84%
But we are seeing declassified
documents and those kind

00:57:04.032 --> 00:57:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of things coming out as well.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all a part of the plan.

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Also, a lot of movies coming
out that are really in alignment

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.700 align:middle line:84%
with the truth and
what's happening--

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.300 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not
necessarily said as the truth.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying that there's
these seeds, these individuals,

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:23.320 align:middle line:84%
these people who are planted
all over the planet who

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.390 align:middle line:84%
are meant to be these
seeds of change,

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to really transmute things.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And so-- yeah.

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that
the cosmic = that's

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.080 align:middle line:84%
happening at that
individual level

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is also really
starting to elevate

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.630 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, all of
the seeds are planted.

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:43.610 align:middle line:90%
All of the pieces are in motion.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going into a
really good trajectory,

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and we're still in the same
timeline of 30 to 50 years

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.090 align:middle line:90%
of the integration.

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Around 30 years from
now, we're going

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to start to see individual
hybrids coming to this planet,

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.610 align:middle line:84%
potentially even being
born through mothers, as

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:05.180 align:middle line:84%
well, on this planet and seeding
the planet in that sense.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And then around
50 years from now,

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.190 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see the
full integration, maybe

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:12.460 align:middle line:84%
not at a whole global
level of 50%, 50%--

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.660 align:middle line:90%
not going to be like that.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.812 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to be known.

00:58:16.812 --> 00:58:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's going to
be known collectively

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's this integration
and the hybrids are coming,

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.520 align:middle line:90%
which is really incredible.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:26.472 align:middle line:84%
Right when I said the
integration and the hybrids

00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:32.350 align:middle line:84%
are coming, I just got this
clip of this individual.

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah it, feels like
a man who's going

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to be a really big
part of the disclosure,

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like he's
either super young or he's

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.880 align:middle line:84%
underground, someone
who's mainstream,

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and it could also be someone
who's already in the limelight

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.900 align:middle line:84%
because they won't show me
who it is or what the name is,

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:84%
but someone who is going
to have a huge impact

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to say, all right,
guys, this is happening,

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.520 align:middle line:90%
and you need to know.

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
there's a lot of weight

00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:01.840 align:middle line:84%
around him, such as he's got
a lot of pull and influence

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.460 align:middle line:84%
within society, and
he's going to be--

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe someone in
Hollywood or something.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.567 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
he's going to be

00:59:06.567 --> 00:59:09.065 align:middle line:84%
a really big part of that
disclosure to prepare people.

00:59:09.065 --> 00:59:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain
point in time, there's

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:13.840 align:middle line:84%
got to be this jarring
moment in society where

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.610 align:middle line:84%
we start to really wake
up and understand, OK,

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:17.780 align:middle line:90%
something's going on.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we say 20, 30
years, 30 to 40, 50 years.

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now seems way off
into imagining that world.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But to really sit down
and imagine a world

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:38.590 align:middle line:84%
where we're integrating
physically with hybrid beings,

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's pretty
far out there.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.888 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, we're saying
this in this show right now,

00:59:44.888 --> 00:59:47.170 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of daydreaming
right now, going, yeah,

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.780 align:middle line:84%
it's so hard to
believe, but yet very

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.540 align:middle line:84%
believable because
of these experiences

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.957 align:middle line:84%
and these conversations
that people are having--

00:59:56.957 --> 00:59:58.540 align:middle line:84%
the disclosure
movement that's already

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.430 align:middle line:84%
started that we can
see in the mainstream

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.710 align:middle line:84%
now with the Navy and all
this stuff that's going on.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And even 20 years ago, it was
hard to believe that a person,

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.890 align:middle line:84%
a human being, can channel an
interdimensional being from

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.500 align:middle line:84%
another galaxy, from another
planet, from another dimension.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even that was hard to
believe even five years ago.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.722 align:middle line:84%
It's still hard to believe
for most people right now,

01:00:19.722 --> 01:00:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and yet it's happening.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.765 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's becoming
more accepted,

01:00:21.765 --> 01:00:22.960 align:middle line:90%
more and more accepted.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> These conversations
are becoming quite normal.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
When I first started this
show five years ago, it was--

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it was a far
out there concept,

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and now people are
like, oh, yeah, yeah.

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I could get on board.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> How much of--

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and you can ask Heera this.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.820 align:middle line:84%
How much of Elizabeth's
DNA has been

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
manipulated to carry
this message right now?

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so how much of a
hybrid is Elizabeth?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a good question.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.410 align:middle line:90%


01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So every human has a variety
of different DNA strands

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.220 align:middle line:90%
from different species.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have, science says,
90% junk DNA or what have you.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So right away, Heera tells
me 33% of my DNA is gray,

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and then I have a variety
of other strands of species

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
within me, definitely
through my genetic line

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of different species,
like Pleiadian or Angelic

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.530 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, the most
predominant one is 33%.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:36.213 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to also ask
him, was I born with that

01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:37.380 align:middle line:90%
through my genetic lineage--

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's one
of my questions too.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --or was that also
manipulated within me

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.390 align:middle line:90%
at a young age?

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:46.100 align:middle line:90%


01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, OK.

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he's saying--
and he actually

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
showed me this really
cool image of my mom when

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I was in her womb, I
guess, being abducted.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:57.780 align:middle line:90%
And I've always wondered this.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Temporarily detailed.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, temporarily--
yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
temporarily detained--

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:04.203 align:middle line:90%
and so this really cool image.

01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've always kind of
been curious about it.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And I even asked my
mom a couple of times.

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.618 align:middle line:84%
Was there any weird
situations that happened

01:02:10.618 --> 01:02:11.910 align:middle line:90%
when you were pregnant with me?

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, all good.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.195 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, cool.

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's really cool.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So they did indeed
inject, I guess--

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
it kind of sounds
forceful, but it wasn't it.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
They increased the DNA
that I had within me,

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and then also part of it
was very natural, as well,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%
coming from my genealogy--

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.998 align:middle line:84%
so a little bit of 50/50,
a little bit of both.

01:02:37.998 --> 01:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there was
definitely some--

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> A little push, a little push.

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> A little push.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.857 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
some genetic manipulation

01:02:42.857 --> 01:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that was going on to support
the knowledge, the information,

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
channel in this lifetime.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And how far back--

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
how about your mother?

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Did she have a
little push for Zeta?

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh interesting, I'll see--

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
take a look at all
of the lineage.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:58.966 --> 01:03:02.910 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:03.896 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:03.896 --> 01:03:08.350 align:middle line:90%


01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, so cool.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, I mean, I don't
see any other manipulation down

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
the genealogy up
until all the way back

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
where there was that
initial manipulation.

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> The Neanderthal.

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The Neanderthal, right?

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But there was also many
other stages of humanity

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
where the abductions
happened and there

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
was that genetic splicing and
more of that creation from all

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
of the different species.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back to both
my mother and my father

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and all of their bloodlines
all the way back,

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.700 align:middle line:90%
which was really interesting.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And yeah-- and Heera was
saying that a lot of my makeup,

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, is very similar to--

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
if we were to say the planet
as a whole or humans as a whole

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and what they're made out of
and taking the average of that,

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm basically the
average of the humans

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
of that extra gray

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that they kind of
implanted when I was a kid.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they had to make sure

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that I was born
into a family that

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
was overall kind of balanced
or average or what have you

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
was so that I could relate
to the majority of the people

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:24.238 align:middle line:84%
out there on the planet in
doing the work that I'm doing.

01:04:24.238 --> 01:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was really cool.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably last question,
unless something comes out

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of this--

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
how much of my DNA has been
manipulated or assisted or--

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say
manipulated-- pushed

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:44.208 align:middle line:84%
for this zeta-human
hybrid agenda?

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's take a look.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.010 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in taking a look at
your genetic makeup and kind

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:03.218 align:middle line:84%
of what went on, especially in
childhood, there was a moment.

01:05:03.218 --> 01:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
There was an abduction
that happened.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that you were
around three or four years old.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a
genetic push in a way.

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any sort of
extra genetics in you.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But you as a soul chose
to come into this body

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:23.210 align:middle line:84%
specifically because of the
DNA coming from your lineage,

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA coming from your
lineage is very Pleiadian.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
So you've got very high--

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
so even Nordic-- some people
call them different things--

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.702 align:middle line:84%
coming from Atlantis
and Lemuria.

01:05:34.702 --> 01:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
where the original kind

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of the planting of the seeds of
the Pleiadian seeds came from.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got a very
high percentage of that just

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.210 align:middle line:90%
naturally within your DNA.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you were a kid,
the Galactic Federation,

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
your cosmic soul family, decided
to take you and chip you.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's in your--

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.435 align:middle line:90%
I want to say it's in your--

01:05:59.435 --> 01:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because sometimes
when I look at you and then

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.102 align:middle line:84%
it's flipped, it's
kind of confusing.

01:06:03.102 --> 01:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's in your
back of your right shoulder.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The chip is currently
deactivated.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But especially when
you were younger,

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
it was this chip
that was intelligent,

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was able to
monitor how much DNA you

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
were opening up and unlocking
at the safest kind of position.

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's really cool.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us, like I said
before, have that natural DNA

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
from a variety of
different species.

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But the DNA can either be
activated or deactivated,

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
laying dormant or active.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And so for you, it
was very important

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.105 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't so
active right away

01:06:40.105 --> 01:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and that you started to really
kind of integrate and come

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.610 align:middle line:90%
into that Pleiadian energy.

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Heera was also saying
that specifically you

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.110 align:middle line:84%
chose more of that
Pleiadian vibration

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and that Pleiadian DNA
because of the compassion

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.760 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiadians.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you are meant
to be a space holder.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You Are meant to be a provider
for a lot of individuals.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, you have
to have a really high amount

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
of compassion for all of the
species, for all of the beings,

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
for all of the humans,
as well, on this planet.

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're very open and
also non-judgemental,

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's where that Pleiadian
kind of DNA comes from.

01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
You also have a variety of other
species and DNA within you,

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
as we all do, and
that also helps you--

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.630 align:middle line:90%
same thing with me--

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
interact with all of
these different humans who

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
have varying degrees of
different DNA within them.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So I always tend to
find that had channeler

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:36.450 align:middle line:84%
who channels Andromeda or
a channeler who channels

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians or a channeler who
channels Grays or Pleiadians

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
or what have you will have the
highest percentage of their DNA

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
into the species that they
are channeling, obviously,

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
match and harmonize

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
with the vibration of the being
that they're bringing through.

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So was the chip-- just to
clarify, is the chip Pleiadian,

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.317 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, or is it Zeta?

01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's Galactic Federation.

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:06.312 align:middle line:84%
But that was implanted in
you from the Pleiadians.

01:08:06.312 --> 01:08:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, from Pleiadians.

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.978 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's important
to understand, too,

01:08:08.978 --> 01:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that not all hybrids and
not all genetic DNA is here

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.819 align:middle line:84%
specifically for the Essassani
or the gray-human hybrid

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:19.080 align:middle line:90%
agenda.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Really, ultimately, before
that was ever an agenda,

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
it was always just
the hybrids are here.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like a huge
experiment on this planet

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to bring together all of these
variety of different genomes

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.529 align:middle line:84%
and different hybrids
and different DNAs

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.907 align:middle line:90%
into one species.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:39.990 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge experiment.

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking this morning
with Fred, a cosmic blender.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We're blending all of this
cosmic energy in a big soup.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And honestly, if we can
blend the lowest vibrations,

01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:58.109 align:middle line:84%
the lowest dimensions,
and the highest dimensions

01:08:58.109 --> 01:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
in the entire universe,
and we can all get along--

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.910 align:middle line:90%
we're not there yet.

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We haven't all gotten along yet.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But if we can do that, we
can be this giant experiment,

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
this cosmic blender, and we
can still love each other.

01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:11.580 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.305 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually
paving the way

01:09:14.305 --> 01:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
for all of the other species out
there in the universe as well.

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:17.730 --> 01:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially what this
ascension experiment sort of

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
is, right?

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it really is.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.069 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Elizabeth.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And thank Heera for
all this knowledge

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and sharing this
Zeta perspective

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
on reality and sort of giving
us higher insights on the Zeta.

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.745 align:middle line:84%
Anything to follow up with at
the end in closing here from--

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see if he has anything
else he wants to mention.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.672 align:middle line:90%


01:09:54.672 --> 01:09:56.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
He actually wanted to
thank you, Rubin, so

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
much for being one of
those seed planters,

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
for being one of those
individuals on this planet who

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is collecting these stories,
collecting this information,

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and divulging it to humanity.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have such a big role
to play in this whole ascension

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.720 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So he just wanted
to say thank you.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.164 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, wherever
you are, Heera.

01:10:23.164 --> 01:10:24.970 align:middle line:90%
There!

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you,
Elizabeth, and look forward

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to talking to our other
friends after lunch.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.770 align:middle line:90%
