00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.955 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many paths to
figuring out the true nature

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:34.755 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The path of my
journey has taken me

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to Sedona, Arizona
several times.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And every time I leave, I find
myself making plans to return.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
first discoveries

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I made during my research
into the ET subject matter.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it was a hard
one to swallow.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to
an ET meetup group

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
at the Flying Saucer
Cafe in Santa Monica.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of the experts
there said that they

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:84%
had spoken to several
abductees who claimed to have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:90%
seen these children on ships.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
They said they
were teaching them

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
how to do mundane daily tasks,
like go grocery shopping

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and wash dishes.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time, I
thought it was ridiculous.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But several years
into my research,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and now I know it to
be more true than not.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the
extra dimensional beings

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed so
far have all confirmed

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
the programs and the
existence of hybrid children.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, a meeting with
Bridget Nielsen--

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful young
lady who says she

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
can communicate directly
with these hybrid children.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
She claims that she
can even show me

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
how to connect to my children.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Though I have no
conscious memory

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of being on board any
ships and having my essence

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
or sperm taken, I'm going
to follow it along and see

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
where this all takes me.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:31.448 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Through the art process, it's
a really easy way of channeling

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:10%
for me, like, my expression.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's an easy way
for me to communicate

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
because I hear through the
conduit of color and shape.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way that
just turns on my access,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
but it also turns that
on for other parents

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
when they do that.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just limited to me.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the playfulness
in the process of creating

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
art too that connects people
with that childlike part

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of themselves that helps
connect them with the kids.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And so particularly, I
think with the kids, even

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
more than, like,
channeling other beings,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I think art is just they can
play through it because they're

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
kids, so they're playing and
it's a way for them to do that.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I work with them.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is by them
contacting me and asking.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
You know we've talked about
the asking the question.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Them, meaning the parents?

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> The parents, the parents.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The parents, OK.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The parents ask
to meet their kids.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like they have
to meet me halfway

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
by like stepping
into that, right?

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
the download comes

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the
kid just comes.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I got
my clairvoyance--

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I just remembered this because
I was across the river.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
My clairvoyance opened the
night after a big meditation

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
in the labyrinth here.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
That's when my
clairvoyance opened.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I was clairaudient, and then
I would draw the picture,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:90%
and then see what it was.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't start visualizing
until 2012 here actually.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
My clairaudience
and clairsentience

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
were like my
strongest abilities.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, I'd get
the download through

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
many different perceptions
over quite a few days, just

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
kind of building the
communication, you know,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
being like, is this what
you're talking about?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.338 align:middle line:84%
No, this is what
I'm talking about.

00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a refinement of
how they want to be expressed.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:90%
And then from there, I draw it.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they're also talking
to me, so then I write.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It's usually like a few
paragraphs to a page

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to the parents about
the kid's energy,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
about their particular
personality,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.155 align:middle line:84%
or like ifs whatnot, and then
I deliver it to the parent.

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What are we
set up here to do?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you can explain
what you're going to do here.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I see pad and pencil.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And what else is
going to happen?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Right here is going to be
the conduit medium of connecting

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:90%
with your hybrid child.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And I got the download
when you asked me.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it's time for him
to come through, and he's--

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Him?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a him--

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:90%
a little preview.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Him-- exciting.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> So 50%.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:90%
We know it's a male.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, this little
boy wants to connect you.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I'm
going to draw him.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.048 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll see how he
wants to present himself.

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
going to be doing.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And usually as you're drawing,
you get other information

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that how
it usually works?

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in
communication with him.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And so he's talking
to me, clairaudient

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
through clairaudience.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I can see him
through clairvoyance,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and then I can feel him.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And so those messages will
then be relayed to you--

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --which he's
already inundating me.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's good.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:90%
He's excited.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Super cool.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll let you
get to work and can't

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.032 align:middle line:90%
wait to see what happens.

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:09.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, thanks.

00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:90%

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So we get to do this now?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.135 align:middle line:84%
>> So should I present to
you first or should you kind

00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:90%
of draw and see what happens?

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, 'cause maybe
I should draw first.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.758 align:middle line:84%
You know, because then
you could see if there's

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
a syncing transmission.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I caught
a slight hair glimpse.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I was trying not to look as I
was checking out the camera.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, let's do it.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you suggest?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I sit here?

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You get to be in
the drivers seat.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And we get to do
my own time lapse.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm seated down here.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.128 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:90%
You gotta walk me through this.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to
walk you through it.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we're doing here is
I channeled and brought through

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:90%
his son.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got messages from
him, particularly for you.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:90%
But this is a fun way of--

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
you said you're more
experiential, right?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to get
my feet wet, yeah.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, more a
visceral experience.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that allows me to
better communicate to the rest

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of the world what's happening,
as opposed to just taking

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:90%
your word for it.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I take your word for
it, but to understand it

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
so if somebody came to me
later and wanted to say, hey,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
what was that experience
like, instead of me just

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
regurgitating what
you said, then now

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.405 align:middle line:84%
I can put it into my own
vocabulary, my own words,

00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and convey it better.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's the important
thing for the hybrid kids is

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:90%
that the parent--

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
embody being a parent--

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --like that starts to happen
because if it's an intellectual

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.341 align:middle line:84%
idea, it's just not going to
be real at all and you're not

00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
going to go anywhere with it.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
So experiencing it
and really connecting,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.767 align:middle line:90%
that's my primary goal.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a little
bit of a challenge with that,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:90%
so then I bridge that.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And then with this, then it
can start to open your conduit.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Bridge it.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a little
bridge it together.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to
bridge it together.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:90%
All right, awesome.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so for this, what
we're doing is, as you know,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
like putting your
hands like right here.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.905 align:middle line:84%
This part of your palm
accesses your right brain.

00:09:02.905 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I did not know that.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so that's why like
typing versus writing accesses

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.955 align:middle line:84%
actually like has a
better conduit energy.

00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I had no idea.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And such as too with
like using a pendulum,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:84%
the energy is coming through
like that right hand,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
so there's something in like
the channeling process that can

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:90%
come easily through that.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're going to
be doing is that the energy is

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:90%
going to come through.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And because he's your
kid, he's connected

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
to your energetic frequency.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.193 align:middle line:90%
It'd be like--

00:09:35.193 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're called--

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
when you have the things
on your body to do the--

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Acupuncture?

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not acupuncture, but
when you're filming and you

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:84%
have the little things,
like, say, in "Avatar"

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:90%
to do the blue--

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the motion capture dots.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Green screen.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like that, except
he can sense you.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's like--

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.497 align:middle line:90%
>> So OK, I see.

00:09:55.497 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so like sensors on you.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So he's the infrared camera.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Picking up the motion.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and the energy.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.153 align:middle line:84%
>> And so he can see through you
and he can experience through

00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
you, or he can then
come through you.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're going
to do is they can access--

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess how energies
come through, like with art,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:90%
is with color, right?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
With a color frequency--
that's a way of communicating,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:90%
as well as shapes or textures.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So it can be abstract.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
It can be real.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be a word.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be a shape.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It can just be a color.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And the big part is--
one of the reasons

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I have watercolors is
that energy transmits

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:90%
much better through water.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some
kind of experience.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Like it's an experience,
and it's not really

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:90%
what the final product is.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the experience of it.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So just kind of pick
up whatever brush you want

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and then dose it in
whatever color you want.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Like whatever comes
to you, and you might--

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you tune into
your different senses, right?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Like if you here green or if
you feel a certain color--

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:90%
you see a certain color.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So just go forth with that,
and then you could also

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:90%
use colored pencils or markers.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Like if those-- you have
full palette of possibility.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.175 align:middle line:84%
But to start like in
a very simple way,

00:11:27.175 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
with the watercolors.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the colors
first, and then--

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So I used to draw
and I used to do art.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, did you?

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> But not for 20 years.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Like in high school, and
then after high school,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.416 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't picked up a--

00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:90%
I think one time, I drew--

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:90%
tried to see if I still had it.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And I drew a picture.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:90%
But I was always very--

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I was never really much
for drawing from my mind.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always like, OK,
I got to look at something.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And then I would draw it.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd look at a
picture and draw it.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So even though I do
have some art background,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
this is still very
foreign to me.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So-- OK, good.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Foreign is good.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's part of the point,
too, is that when we're kids,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
we play and we draw
and color and stuff.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And then as adults, we don't.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's like it taps you
into your kid self, which

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:90%
then taps you into your kid.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nice.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:90%
So just-- am I ready?

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it set?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.045 align:middle line:90%
>> You're ready, set, go.

00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Like we talked
about earlier, you

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:90%
can do a question if you want.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yes.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Questions would be better.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> To activate.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Question to activate the--

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
to create the vibrational
frequency so the answer

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:90%
can come through.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:58.596 --> 00:12:59.396 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Let me think of a question.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:10.215 align:middle line:84%
First question I was going to
ask was what color skin do you

00:13:10.215 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:90%
have?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that strange?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever asked that?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but I like it.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe seeing the color
made me ask that question.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe seeing the color?

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of saw
this color here.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.037 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what happens
when I put some--

00:13:29.037 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:90%
We'll just start going with it.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Some water into it.

00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Do they question themselves
about who they are?

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> They ask questions about--

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> They're curious about--

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Who they're to become.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> To become.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
They ask a lot of
questions about us.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that
because they are--

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
because of the
genetic backgrounds?

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They know that they're
going to become something

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
kind of like us, but--

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're trained
to come to Earth.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Like they're literally in--

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
their school is how
to fit in as a human.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they already are
complete in their essences

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're very expressed
in their essences.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So now it's, how do I translate
that to Earth, you know.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So they ask questions
like, why do you eat meat?

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Why do you kill animals?

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do you pollute yourselves?

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like--
it ends up being more

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of questions.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But just to understand why
we do what we do, you know?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Well that can all be summed
up in one easy phrase--

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:90%
lack of awareness.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just a lack of--

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:90%
that's all.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.136 align:middle line:90%
If you're born with awareness--

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you're--

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you're kind of--

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Going to be conscious, right?

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're going to be--

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and then, yeah, you look
at these other people who

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
aren't, and you're like, why?

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're in an
interesting-- the kids--

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
because some of their parents
won't make it to the reality

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:90%
where they land.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's like they can't care.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> But they have ET--

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But they have
feelings, though.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.386 align:middle line:90%
>> But they have ET--

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:90%
they have other--

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Caretakers.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Caretakers.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Gray DNA, so to say so we're
not their only parents.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we're their--

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
the grays were never
designed to be like parent.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It was more they're just
an extra dose of DNA.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Like we were designed--
like for instance,

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
this kid that you're
talking with right now--

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you have over 60%
of your DNA in him.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's a lot.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I was even
thinking almost no DNA,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and I think I heard you say
in one interview about kind

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:90%
of energy--

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Energetic contributor?

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They're interested
in energy, as well as--

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> DNA.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was thinking
more energy,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:90%
but you're saying maybe 60%.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.155 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would we call--
we'd call like mojo?

00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mojo and energy?

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mojo and--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It's secret sauce.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If they're like, we
like your body vessel.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And the energy.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So the first ones
to contact a parent

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
are the ambassador children.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's usually one
or two, or maybe three,

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
but usually one or two that
come to the parent first.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
initial ones that

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
build that real connection.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And then aside from that,
once that connection's built,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
then other ones can
come circling in.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But those first ones
are the highest--

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
have the highest amount
of the human parent's DNA.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:90%
So they're the most similar.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So that it's the most
easily synced up.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And then some of the
ones that you meet later

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
might have a lesser percentage
or might be more alien or weird

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:90%
or not like you.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But these ones are
really very similar.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of parents
almost can confuse them

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:90%
with their own self as a child.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
They're like, this just seems
so much like me as a kid.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's-- that's
exactly right.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It really is like
the perfection of you

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as a kid copied again
into another kid.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> This kind of--

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you earlier at
breakfast how I had this--

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even see vision,
but more of a feeling last week

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:90%
during a meditation.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was this idea
that my offspring would

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
be an even less
denser version of me,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm still
evolving and still

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
have a good portion
of my life, I hope,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
left of me here on this
planet or elsewhere.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I like how you're practicing
all of your statements now.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Kids in this reality living
on this planet or elsewhere.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we have to be
careful with our words.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Just having that awareness,
again, and the connection

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to the father energy
and the density,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and then this light--
this even lighter form.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I've been able
to, in my evolution,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:90%
reach this sort of stage--

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.037 align:middle line:90%
you know, just imagining what--

00:19:14.037 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
like if you were to hit
the reset button from now.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, from here on,
if your kid is going

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to start here and
then evolve and go

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
beyond where I am now
with my-- you know,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:90%
it just kind of blew me away.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of realizing, oh
wow, that's totally doable.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.038 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess that's why
we live vicariously through

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
our children, because their
evolution and their paths are

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
they can go so much further than
we can because of our density,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess, and our
attachments to this reality

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and this third
dimensional world.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah, that's cool.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even comprehend
children and what

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that whole experience
would be like,

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and you know-- and
I see people and I

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.375 align:middle line:90%
see the love and the passion.

00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah, OK.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>> For you.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.725 align:middle line:90%
I'm not there yet.

00:20:09.725 --> 00:20:10.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I totally appreciate
you appreciating that.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that's the thing.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because they're
teaching us to lighten up.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, like they're
having you paint right now,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, how do
we keep evolving out

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:90%
of this rigid density?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.495 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you had your
father paint, I mean--

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:31.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> He might loosen up there
for a second, you know?

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's like that's--

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big motivation,
especially for the hybrids,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to have this--

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to have us lighten
up, because then we'll

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:90%
make it to that reality.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if we're just
super dense, we won't.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're like, all right,
let's do this, you know?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that you had

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that experience with
the different lineages--

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:90%
like the archetypes.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Like father, son--

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
father, son archetype.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they take, as you
know, like with abduction

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
through the genetic lineage.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they probably took
your grandfather, father, you,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and then the result--

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.916 align:middle line:90%
you're a hybrid kid.

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And each one, they
upgraded your genetics--

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> More and more.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And well, I've always--
on my family side,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I always thought my mom
was the one that had been--

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:84%
because she talks about
when she was little,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
she had some contact
experiences and stuff.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So I always kind of thought
that was more on her side.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I mean, it could
go on either side, right?

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, and that's like--

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the healing
world or whatever,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
like soul retrievals and taking
back those parts of ourselves

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that have had to be
pushed out or suppressed

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:84%
due to this world and the
way that it is, you know.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Like re-kindling those
pushed out parts,

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the reason
we can't connect with kids

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is because we have some pushed
out part of our childhood self.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we tend to do that.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I have tried for a large
majority of my life

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to be pretty playful and not
take things too seriously,

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and connect to that inner child.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And I do that through
my work with anime

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.604 align:middle line:84%
and with video game
characters and stuff.

00:22:44.604 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.998 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm not quite sure
where we're going with this--

00:22:50.998 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:90%
if there's much more left to do.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's in a good place.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I might-- I was thinking
that of going full goggle.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Go for goggle if
that's-- is that what--

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you're feeling.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It's probably-- if
this hat isn't--

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
it probably doesn't
look like much

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of anything right
now, but at least

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
what this has inspired
me to do is to get more--

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
to go out and get some
watercolors and have some fun.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> See, this is good.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.942 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what needs to happen.

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:21.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:21.742 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Get some more hair on him.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and that's the
point, is like they said,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:90%
opening up that playfulness.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Conduit, which is always
the message from them.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that's-- and so
earlier, I said the--

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.097 align:middle line:10%
what's the secret
of the universe?

00:23:43.097 --> 00:23:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, emotion.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And Bashar and others have
talked about this before,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's really-- it's all about
the emotion of joy, you know?

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And what brings
you the most joy.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you see little
kids, I mean, they've got--

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
wow, what an emotional
spectrum they have.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:90%
They can go back and forth.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
they're living in joy.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And everything just
makes them happy.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> For the most part.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.567 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and the little
stupidest things, too.

00:24:25.567 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they can play
with, like, wrappers.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, like toilet paper,
and they're just ecstatic.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's-- yeah.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:90%
So why do we have to--

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
why can't we be
ecstatic over wrappers?

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.285 align:middle line:84%
So I see that, and
I'm like, oh, yeah.

00:24:41.285 --> 00:24:42.085 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:42.085 --> 00:24:43.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it's
just the conditioning.

00:24:43.752 --> 00:24:45.775 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, no,
you need to buy a toy

00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:90%
and it needs to be like this.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.124 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:24:50.124 --> 00:24:52.116 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:52.116 --> 00:25:01.578 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.578 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so let's see here.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll go over some of the
messages that he was saying.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Like when I was drawing.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And then how it's translated
through your drawing.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is his-- like,
well first of all,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the statement he made was, who
do you think came up with this

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:90%
whole series?

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Like this series that
you guys are doing.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.667 align:middle line:84%
>> He's like, do you think I did
not help with this whole thing?

00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, gotcha.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So he's, like, very--

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
like you guys in dream time,
and even though you might not

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
be conscious of it, are like
working intimately together

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:90%
'cause he's helping the process.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, from
the other side.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And so that was--

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I know in the past--

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, increasingly,
my dreams have been just

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.637 align:middle line:84%
getting more and more
intense, and I forget them.

00:25:56.637 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I need to write them down.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I wake up and I'm
just like, whoa.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.907 align:middle line:90%
>> What just happened?

00:26:00.907 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, gotta snap
back to this reality.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>> You know.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But constantly, I'm
waking up with this--

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.355 align:middle line:84%
I just-- some crazy
stuff that happened.

00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> There's stuff happening.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Stuff happening.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you consciously
go to sleep

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
connecting with him about this,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
you'll start remembering and
he'll start coming to you,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and you'll start hearing his
specific frequency guiding

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
you as a part of
your crew, you know?

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Like he's a third person
being like, let's do this.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big thing.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I am a
major part of this.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Like how do you think you got
here right now, doing this,

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, whatever
your name is.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that's
the next question.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:90%
His name is Sion.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Sion.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:90%
S-I-O-N.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> S-I-O-N.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, not Zion.

00:26:56.155 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I was like, Zion?

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, Sion.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sion.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, cool.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:04.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Sion.

00:27:04.203 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to
see the drawing?

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's

00:27:06.075 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's see it.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.608 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:09.608 --> 00:27:10.604 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:27:10.604 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to
just place it here.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Nine.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Look at them eyes.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.561 align:middle line:90%
>> They're green eyes.

00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like pretty green.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So it does look very human.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> They do look
more human than not.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> A bit.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the ones later in
the program look very alien,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
like the ones that will come
to Earth a few years after--

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> --everything, landing takes
place, they'll be more alien.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But the first ones that
have the most of our DNA

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.265 align:middle line:84%
will be the ones that
look the most human too.

00:27:58.265 --> 00:27:59.065 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:59.065 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So what does one of age nine on
a starship, what kind of toys

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:90%
do you play with?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's looks
like some goggles.

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:16.632 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.698 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:22.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:22.216 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and they have like
those holographic screens--

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they work
with and stuff.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:90%
They're like--

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.818 align:middle line:84%
>> So they've got like
iPads out of the ying-yang.

00:28:30.818 --> 00:28:31.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, like iPad version 13--

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, that could
probably do some cool stuff.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.256 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, interesting.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.605 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What would be on
a smaller scale?

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>> For them?

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Or for us?

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The integration
and everything.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- no, no.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Personally, I guess--

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --is there any-- did anything
come through on a more per--

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.472 align:middle line:84%
let's stick with the
personal stuff today.

00:28:57.472 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow,
we'll go bigger.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams, that was like
the biggest thing is for you

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
to like--

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.911 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the way that they--

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
the way for you to shift to the
dimension where they then land

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is through remembering that you
already have that connection.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Like when you heard
Sion, you're like, hm.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:90%
You know, like--

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> There's like--

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't quite place where.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:90%
But I'm like--

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.175 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a haze.

00:29:24.175 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I know the
cars, the Scion car.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then like
the other things.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:90%
But I'm like, no.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.298 align:middle line:90%
There's something else there.

00:29:32.298 --> 00:29:35.262 align:middle line:90%
There's something more.

00:29:35.262 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:90%
There's something more there.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite
place it right now.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So just like that,
it's like work.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to work through
the haze of our forgetfulness.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So you did the regression
with Barbara Lamb.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.133 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's like, OK.

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's remember this stuff.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's remember
the abduction stuff.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's remember that I
meet with them in dreamtime.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's remember that I have them.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are the other ones?

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So like really honing that,
which dreamtime is probably

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
the easiest way to do that.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And so to really
remember your dreams,

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:90%
like you were saying, right?

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.167 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the biggest way that
he was saying that he could

00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
really connect with you.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And then also through
playing and having fun,

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
it's just getting that
conduit of communication

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
so second nature
to where they're

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.775 align:middle line:90%
like standing by you almost.

00:30:27.775 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh, yeah,
like my buddy, kind of.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I can hear them.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm communing with them to
where then, one day, they just--

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.600 align:middle line:84%
like your dream becomes
your waking reality,

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing
next to you.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Like where it's
just [WHOOSH NOISE]..

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they
dimensionally themselves?

00:30:46.527 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Are they in the third dimension?

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Are they in
third-dimensional density?

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Or are they more of a
fifth-dimensional body density?

00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So the integration, is it
more as Earth and humanity

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
evolves into the
fifth-dimensional beingness,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.645 align:middle line:84%
then that's when we're
going to interact with them?

00:31:08.645 --> 00:31:09.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:09.445 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they're not
going to lower their density

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:90%
to a third-dimensional density.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, these ones are pretty
interesting because they've had

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
they have to bridge it,
bridge like fifth and third,

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
third and fifth.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And one way that we're seeing
is through the human kids.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
That are incredible.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%
So they keep--

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it goes
into star children.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Upgrading our DNA-- your
dad, you, then these kids.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So the kids alive right now,
such as the autistic kids

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
or like the rainbow
crystal kids,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
they're just there
almost, like almost.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They're one-- I think one of
the channels said that one

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
chromosome away, like one,
just slight, you know, like--

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> One chromosome away of from--

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> From being a hybrid kid.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Like from being the same
genetic structure as these

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
hybrid kids coming.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So but, I mean, but then
these ones weren't raised

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:84%
necessarily with
the Earth programs.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> So then you've got that--

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So you don't
have that karmic--

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, imprint.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --imprint.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be teach us--

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --as opposed to
us teaching them.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot for
us to teach them too.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But it is more of like, right
now, they're guiding us out,

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But these-- and
then these kids--

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And guiding to that
meeting point, kind of.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And these kids, why
I said they're--

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the ambassador kids are like
the majority DNA of you.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And so they're the most--

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of seems
like a derogatory term,

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
but they're the most
watered-down aliens.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know what I mean?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like as close as
they can still be on a ship--

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:90%
In the fifth dimension

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --in fifth dimension, but
then still be able to make it

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the refinement
that they got to

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that would
be able to be received.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So they would look human enough
and energetically not just

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:90%
like [WHOOSH NOISE] blow us out.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then that's why the land
places are so important,

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
where the fifth-dimensional
frequencies on Earth, because

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth
frequencies just exist.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So Sedona, Maui,
and the sacred sites,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the land, the
frequency of the environment

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.110 align:middle line:90%
supports them.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the people, at the
time they get to these spots,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
will hopefully be light
enough to then receive them.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it'll be
a crazy assimilation.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure people
will lose it,

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and it it'll just be
complete immersion in

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that there won't probably
be anything else happening--

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
no jobs, no-- you're
just like, oh, my gosh.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:84%
This kid just disappeared
in front of my eyes

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and teleported over there.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just going to be--

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had my
own kind of trying

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to come to terms in how the
fifth-dimensional reality is

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.500 align:middle line:90%
going to integrate here.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I can't think about it.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.302 align:middle line:90%
>> Because the logic--

00:34:25.302 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:90%
and there is no logic to it.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't logically make sense
of how it's going to happen.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I've heard from
extradimensional beings

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that I've interviewed until now
that have actually said this.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're all saying it.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.662 align:middle line:84%
They're all saying we're
moving to the fifth dimension.

00:34:42.662 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:84%
And this is why everything's
so exciting to be here,

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
helping us along.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
But I can't even imagine
how it's going to happen.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, this is one way
to have these children come

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:84%
in and help with
that, I imagine.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.752 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I can't
wrap my head around

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that I want to-- and
maybe I'm not supposed to.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But let me just
throw it out there.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, are these
children, are they--

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
they're all not necessarily
hybrid Zeta Reticuli children.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Or are they?

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.195 align:middle line:84%
Are they all Zeta
Reticuli, or are they

00:35:24.195 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:90%
a mixture of other races?

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a great question.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:30.448 --> 00:35:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, Bashar
answered this one for me.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And the answer is
that in that program,

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:43.955 align:middle line:84%
they never had to use any DNA
from any other civilizations,

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
like go over to Pleiades
and be like, hey.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
even have DNA.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Do they?

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> The fifth dimensional--

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, it's
kind of like, I guess,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:90%
more of an energetic--

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, energetic.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> --template type thing.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is is that we
have all of those genetic codes

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:90%
So they're like, oh.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.462 align:middle line:84%
So this kid, someone
could be more Arcturian,

00:36:07.462 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
or someone could
be more Pleiadian.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But that just means
that they're taking--

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that your lineage had more of
that particular strain, which

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:90%
is why it was chosen.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And so there can be
ones that are more--

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I do feel ones that are
more Sirian, you know,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Sirian hybrid kids
that just have

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.540 align:middle line:90%
more of that Sirian template.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel that
in their parents,

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
like you can just feel
that whole thing going on.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So technically, yeah, it is
only Zeta, which Zeta is human.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Like different.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, where
there's an aspect,

00:36:40.785 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a portion of
humanity that came from them.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Right,
parallel-reality human.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's like Zeta
human, human-human,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and then all of the yummy ET
stuff that is in the human.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, Pleiadian.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Arcturian, Orion.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Arcturian, Orion, OK.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:01.095 --> 00:37:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> There's eight.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.922 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, depending
on who you talk to,

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
because some merge
with other ones.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But there's like eight.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
My mind is blown.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:90%
This is awesome.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:12.968 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:37:12.968 --> 00:37:14.176 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome, very much.

00:37:14.176 --> 00:37:18.642 align:middle line:84%
>> I will definitely
meditate on Sion.

00:37:18.642 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:90%
This is the Anima.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
This is Bashar's
female counterpart.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.488 align:middle line:90%
And after she--

00:37:28.488 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>> What's her name again?

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Anima.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Anima.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's only
come through Daryl

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s when he first
started channeling and then

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.988 align:middle line:84%
for one time during a private
session for one of my friends.

00:37:40.988 --> 00:37:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And after I heard the
private session that night,

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I went into this deep
trance and went to Sassani.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And her eyes became my
eyes, and I saw her.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And so this is what I saw.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> This was her.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:90%
So she's awesome.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
She helps assimilate the
hybrid children to Earth.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:84%
She'll come down and
help the whole situation.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's very integrated
into this whole thing.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So I guess it's
appropriate to have her on.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bashar, he's
kind of an ambassador.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that what--

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:90%
He's a contact specialist.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.185 align:middle line:90%
>> A contact specialist?

00:38:12.185 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.468 align:middle line:84%
>> With just the human
race or with many?

00:38:15.468 --> 00:38:16.427 align:middle line:90%
>> With all, with many.

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> With many races.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> With many.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she comes
in afterwards,

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:84%
like he makes first
contact, and then she

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:90%
comes in to merge that.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
And then this is Drake.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my hybrid
kids who came through.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had a
question about him.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:90%
He looks kind of reptilian?

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be correct.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So there is not
just Gray hybrids.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:90%
There's Reptilian hybrids.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is
obviously more risque.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's
like one thing

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to have them looking
like this or something.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:90%
But to have them Reptilian?

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's just,
as you probably

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
know, too many cases of women
having sex with Reptilians

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:90%
on ships.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's obviously going
to result in something.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then I started
recalling those experiences

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:90%
for myself.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And then a few
women had that week

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:84%
been talking about their hybrid
kids that were Reptilian.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.430 align:middle line:90%
And then it just all sunk.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, gosh.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had sleep on
that for a few days.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And then he came through.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And a completely
different race,

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
completely different thing
going on, or are they working

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Reptilians
work with the Zetas.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems like the
Zetas are working with everybody

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.268 align:middle line:84%
though, Pleiadians, or
the Tall Whites, and the--

00:39:45.268 --> 00:39:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they work with them in
the case of-- they don't work

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
directly with them,
like I said yesterday.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They work with the
DNA of them in us.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So, but in the
case of these guys,

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of they're
not going to be the ambassadors,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:84%
like we're not going to see
Reptilian kids come first

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yeah, that might
be a little shocking.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think later on that
they'll be integrated.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And with the Reptilians
being terrestrial,

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:84%
created from the
genomic experiment,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and being the primal energy
of kind of human race through

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:84%
the dinosaurs, it makes sense
that they would be integrated

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:84%
into the next evolution of
humanity as a whole being,

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:90%
like dinosaurs and humans.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And who's this hybrid
child on the far left?

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.318 align:middle line:90%
>> That's me.

00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:84%
That was me when I
was a little girl.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I drew that.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> She can be on the wall.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.850 align:middle line:90%
She's a hybrid child too.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:90%
This is Sapphire.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And he, this guy from New
York, got him channeled.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And then one of my friends
from Los Angeles who I dated,

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.680 align:middle line:90%
it's his kid.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then so there's just
kind of this mixing.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.295 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of like, as
the parent group grows

00:41:06.295 --> 00:41:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and I know the
different parents,

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I can see the different
slices in each child.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And he came to me in a lucid.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And his just eyes were
like, [VOCALIZING],,

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.860 align:middle line:84%
like just bright
blue in the dark.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was just pretty amazing.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what the
glowing represents there.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the blue
swirl behind him?

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> He's kind of like a shamanic
journeyer here for parents

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:90%
or for humans to take them.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.630 align:middle line:90%
He's really connected to Sirius.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And so he takes them
to those memories

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and unlocks that genetic coding.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's kind of like a path.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is Lily Luna.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my daughters.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen her
several times in dreams.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But she popped up pretty much
exactly like that, lucid,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:90%
like very physical.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they come to me
lucid, it's just like really

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
intense because it's
just, pow, you know?

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Wah.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And she came to me right
before I went to Mount Shasta.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's really connected
to the crown chakra.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And they all have dominant
archetypal essences.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And hers is more of
the high priestess.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she
gave the symbology

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of the crescent moon,
which is usually

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:90%
at the feet in the tarot.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, she
put it at the crown

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.470 align:middle line:84%
because we were going
to the crown chakra.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the violet
flame kind of on the head.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:90%
So she's one of my favorites.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:90%
She comes around the most.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
She would be my top
ambassador child.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Would she be one of your
first children, do you think?

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first ones were
still kind of like sickly

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:90%
and not as--

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:90%
So even yours--

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Even mine.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.755 align:middle line:84%
>> --even some of your first
ones were part of that first

00:43:00.755 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:90%
batch.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in my
regression with Barbara,

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:84%
my first memory of right when I
started menstruating at age 12,

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a small child that
was like this little boy,

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:90%
very frail.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And his hips weren't
developing properly.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they
extracted hip tissue.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And then to try and save him--
for me, and in the regression,

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I could feel this huge needle
going, like I could still

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.870 align:middle line:90%
feel this cellular memory.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was so painful.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the experience
of all the stuff,

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I know how abductees
feel in that case.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And Barbara was
just saying, it's now.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:42.810 align:middle line:90%
You're now.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Bridget, remember, you're now.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're remembering
that, but it's just a memory.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But they extracted hip
tissue to try and save him,

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and he ended up dying.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 12 at
that time, I actually

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:84%
did remember because I did
a lot of competitive dance

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.720 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I remember actually bawling
when doing hip stretches.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:05.460 align:middle line:84%
There was something released,
and I had no context as to why.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.518 align:middle line:84%
>> So, yeah, pretty
interesting--

00:44:10.518 --> 00:44:11.450 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stuff.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, what's this?

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.205 align:middle line:90%
What's the--

00:44:13.205 --> 00:44:14.005 align:middle line:90%
>> This?

00:44:14.005 --> 00:44:14.805 align:middle line:90%
>> --the sign here.

00:44:14.805 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> This came through last
January as kind of a new

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.460 align:middle line:84%
upgrade for the parents to
start connecting more with

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.750 align:middle line:90%
their kids.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And this symbol, the triangle
with the interior reverse

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:31.840 align:middle line:84%
triangle, is the symbol,
the contact energy

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:90%
for the hybrid kids.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.745 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the
"Legend of Zelda."

00:44:34.745 --> 00:44:35.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Link.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And the Triforce.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that cool?

00:44:39.633 --> 00:44:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the symbol.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, Bashar said that--

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I kept getting that.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.713 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, yeah, that's
the symbol for the hybrid kids.

00:44:47.713 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
That's their
energetic blueprint.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this one is
a telepathic game

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that the parents
play with their kids.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- and it was also to
bring in more kids at once.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Because, usually,
one kid's energy

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is pretty intense, like one
hybrid when you're connected.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
a group of them,

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.530 align:middle line:84%
which they come as
groups, it's going

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.620 align:middle line:90%
to be a lot, a lot of energy.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a practice
for them to feel six kids

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.680 align:middle line:84%
or whatever coming at
one time into their field

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and feeling kind of the
dizziness of that frequency.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you're kind
of like, wait.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Shh.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all telepathic.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And then it's like, OK, shh.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet for a second.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I need to hear her.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing happens
when they land because they'll

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.820 align:middle line:90%
be telepathic with us.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of sorting
and practicing telepathy

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.120 align:middle line:90%
as well as-- let's see.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:90%
So what else is in this?

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So each of the kids
have a different--

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:84%
have a particular
signature encoding

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that is intertwined
with Earth because they

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.670 align:middle line:90%
were designed to come to Earth.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And so on the top is
their color frequency.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of the kids are
associated with a certain color

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.500 align:middle line:90%
spectrum of the rainbow.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're more oriented
towards like a violet frequency

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
or like a orange frequency,
associated usually

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.270 align:middle line:90%
with the chakras.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they will come
to that place on Earth that is

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.250 align:middle line:90%
associated with that frequency.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So green, heart chakra,
Maui, and then they're

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:84%
designed actually
for that location.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Some can be designed for
multiple locations as well.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
usually associated

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
animal kind of totem

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that associates
with their energy,

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and their personality, and as
well as some natural thing,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.560 align:middle line:84%
so whether it's a
stone or a plant.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.252 align:middle line:84%
And they are usually named
after those natural things.

00:46:49.252 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
teaching us how

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to be natural, which is ironic.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:58.380 align:middle line:84%
A kid on a spaceship is like,
my name is Sage Primrose.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's oriented to those
frequencies of birth.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a conduit,
paradoxically, like up.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle is
the contact symbol

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that the parent then
channels as their signature.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So this would be
a signature of Neo

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.720 align:middle line:84%
or a signature of
these different kids.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And we did this with the
people that lived in the house.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is all of
our different kids.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Not, I mean, all of them.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a few of them.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go-- before we
skip to the next thing,

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:90%
what's behind us here?

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> This?

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is, I guess, it's
kind of a contact symbol.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to start doing
more sacred geometry

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.365 align:middle line:90%
art and mandala.

00:47:41.365 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of Tibetan energy.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's a painting that I
did to bring in that energy.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the abstract
art that I do just

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.430 align:middle line:84%
opens different
dimensions and portals.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
was doing with that.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Copy that.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:84%
This is another one of
the game, different kids

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And this guy is
really interesting.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we had this
kid living here--

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:90%
he lived in that room--

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:84%
who was more connected to
the ETs than I think anyone

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.460 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every night
he would dream lucid

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:84%
with hybrids and with all
these different beings.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And he, particularly, would
come out every morning

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and just be like, oh, my gosh.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I had the craziest
contact dreams.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this one time, he
said, I met my brother,

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Terra, his hybrid brother.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's awesome.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.960 align:middle line:84%
You should draw him, like it's
a really good thing to draw him.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh,
I'll get around to it--

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one night, just
this kid just came to me.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, you
have to draw me.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, finally, I just
got down and drew him.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.500 align:middle line:90%
And I brought it out.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And the kid goes, whoa,
that's my brother, Terra.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to come through
so badly that he came through me

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.460 align:middle line:90%
because he wouldn't draw him.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it's
exactly who he saw.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And he knew the name too?

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:12.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:13.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was pretty cool.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is Amber, and
this is my hybrid daughter.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And she came to
me the first night

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I was with Patrick,
my boyfriend.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And we were on--

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:29.942 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in some
emotional state,

00:49:29.942 --> 00:49:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what
just had happened.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back in
kind of like a regression,

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:84%
self-regression,
back up to the ship.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And she was standing there.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I was lucid, and I
just was looking at her.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And she telepathically
said, my name

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is Amber-- like
connected to the earth

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.950 align:middle line:84%
again and very connected
to the redwoods.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.933 align:middle line:84%
And then she started messing
with me while I was lucid.

00:49:54.933 --> 00:49:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I was trying to see
her eyes, but she wouldn't let

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.150 align:middle line:90%
me see them.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.390 align:middle line:90%
So she made them really small.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, your eyes aren't--
she made them like pins.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, your eyes
aren't the size of pins.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I was expecting
something big.

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And then she finally evened out.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's her, so
that's who I saw.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> She looks like you.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.818 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, they
look like their parents.

00:50:17.818 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it could be
completely opposite too.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.530 align:middle line:90%
So they can--

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Like this guy up here.

00:50:22.627 --> 00:50:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it can be--

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a little blue.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Super blue.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Are a lot of them blue?

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I've noticed a
lot of drawings, not just

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
from yourself but
others, that tend

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to have this kind
of bluish skin tone.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Answer would be because
a lot of the kids

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that I started seeing in the
beginning have blue skin,

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.760 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I asked
Bashar about it.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they don't
actually have blue skin.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the blue
frequency that you're

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.040 align:middle line:84%
picking up on that makes it
seem like they have blue skin.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Some actually would.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, it's
just more the frequency.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Na'vi in
that movie "Avatar,"

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.150 align:middle line:90%
that's just their auras.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.390 align:middle line:90%
They're so--

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I think that that's real.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.332 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's Annunak--

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:09.530 align:middle line:90%
like the blue Anunnaki.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Blue Anunnaki?

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.825 align:middle line:90%
>> I never heard of that.

00:51:11.825 --> 00:51:12.625 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:13.745 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:51:13.745 --> 00:51:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you have.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard of blue Annu--

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.120 align:middle line:90%
I know Anunnaki.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.380 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know blue.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard that
from a lot of people,

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.680 align:middle line:90%
that the Anunnaki were blue?

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.673 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.673 --> 00:51:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the little girl
I was telling you about,

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.970 align:middle line:84%
the one that the guy I was
dating saw the picture of.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And he just froze,
and then heard her,

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and had this little experience
from seeing the drawing.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So her name is Crystal.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.140 align:middle line:90%
She's really sweet.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the first
daughter's that came to me.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.952 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:51:41.952 --> 00:51:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:45.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on the tour.

00:51:45.933 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And then these three came
through for an animation that I

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.980 align:middle line:84%
was going to do when a guy
wanted to do like a animated

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.240 align:middle line:90%
series with the hybrid kids.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And so these
were the ones that--

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:84%
like how they wanted to
be presented for that.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is a younger version
of my hybrid sister, Geo.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.660 align:middle line:90%
And so she's--

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I am very connected to her, and
she's my dad's daughter, which

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.315 align:middle line:90%
would then be my hybrid sister.

00:52:16.315 --> 00:52:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.377 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we're
really connected.

00:52:19.377 --> 00:52:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember playing
with her when I was little,

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:90%
on the ships and stuff.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So she's my buddy.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
These are drawings of the two
little girls that I babysitted.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:33.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And what are the--

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.310 align:middle line:90%
is this Drake again?

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> This one?

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a different kid.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know his name.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.965 align:middle line:84%
He just was like, I want
to be in this animation.

00:52:44.965 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And they all started to kind
of jump in front of each other.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:84%
They're like, well,
I want to be in it.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So he just kind of came to me.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And how about the top
one with the pointy ears?

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Her?

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> She's like an elven hybrid.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So they can-- I mean,
they can design them.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They made all different
kinds of kiddos.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And so she has more of
like an elven energy.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So Spock is an elf?

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she's Spock's
great-great-great-granddaughter.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Or grandmother.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Because in that, in
Star Trek, it goes to the--

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Into the future.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.385 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:53:21.385 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are symbols
I downloaded.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I swam with dolphins
in Hawaii for a week.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was incredibly
connected to my Sirian

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.680 align:middle line:84%
counterpart, who I didn't
even know that I had.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And these symbols, and
there were probably

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:41.230 align:middle line:84%
like four times this amount,
just kept coming through,

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:45.322 align:middle line:84%
kept coming through, that were
archetypals, Sirian symbols.

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty cool stuff.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And what's this
drawing behind you?

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this is a painting--
well, speaking of dolphins,

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:04.620 align:middle line:84%
these are the different portals,
portal paintings that I create

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and that open
dimensional frequencies.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And some people that
have them actually

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.357 align:middle line:84%
have seem like orbs come through
them, like physical orbs,

00:54:13.357 --> 00:54:15.440 align:middle line:84%
like people that don't
even believe in this stuff.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that have your paintings?

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So you paint these
for other people too?

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I used to do like fine art
in galleries in LA and stuff.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
little kid drawings.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And, so--

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's so cool.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
certain frequency

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.080 align:middle line:90%
that just comes through.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's not me painting.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like Bridget goes
away, and just whatever

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.360 align:middle line:84%
portal comes through,
comes through.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And this one is more of
like a dolphin birth portal.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I guess there would be birth
portals usually associated

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:53.300 align:middle line:84%
with Arcturus,
the Arcturus Gate.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's more of that frequency.

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And behind you, we
have some watercolors.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Watercolors, just different
rainbow stuff happening.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And who's this down--
this blue being here?

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> This one?

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:84%
She's Lily Luna, the one
that you saw out there.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:90%
With the crescent on the head.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:90%
But that was the first--

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.740 align:middle line:84%
this is the first
way that I saw her

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.907 align:middle line:84%
because I saw her through
the frequency in the blue,

00:55:23.907 --> 00:55:24.707 align:middle line:90%
like I said.

00:55:24.707 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And then once I could
orient more to the energy,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.740 align:middle line:84%
then I could see
more of her form.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So it changes as
your filter changes.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was like the first
rendition of how I saw her,

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and then it changed
into that out there.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I was lucid in this
dream with hybrid kids.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And in most of the dreams
that I have with them,

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm either teaching
them art or I'm

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.140 align:middle line:84%
teaching them dance, which
are like my two main mediums.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And this one time, we were
drawing these paintings

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:90%
with natural materials.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And the little girl, paint--

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:84%
found the most
amazing color brown.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:90%
This is such a beautiful brown.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:06.030 align:middle line:90%
What did you use for this?

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I was doing
the natural art.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And she just like
looks up at me.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, poop.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.480 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, I used poo.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.355 align:middle line:90%
You used poo on the painting?

00:56:21.355 --> 00:56:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
cool, very creative.

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was those certain
things that you can't make up.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:56:29.368 --> 00:56:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So anyways, I guess that
kind of reminds me of that.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not poop though?

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not poop.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.020 align:middle line:90%
That's Sedona red rocks.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.753 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
get any poop going.

00:56:36.753 --> 00:56:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to be clear.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We do lucid dreaming
workshops online that are

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.900 align:middle line:84%
associated with lucid dreaming
for contact or lucid dreaming

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:84%
with hybrid kids,
just in that realm.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of the activities
that we would do

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is to merge the two realities
of this dream reality

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:90%
with our sleeping dream reality.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the more
that you can realize

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that this is an illusionary
dream, the more that you

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.580 align:middle line:90%
can merge that and become--

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.920 align:middle line:84%
you can also become more
lucid in your sleeping dream

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.350 align:middle line:84%
by doing that and
then also become

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:16.630 align:middle line:84%
more conscious of the real
reality of this dimension

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:18.110 align:middle line:90%
by having those reminders.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have these reminders
all over our house.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.740 align:middle line:84%
This symbol, as we said,
is the contact symbol

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.120 align:middle line:90%
for the hybrid kids.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And then these two on the
outside and the other ones

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.550 align:middle line:84%
were downloaded by my
friend, the one that

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:34.745 align:middle line:84%
had all of the dreams, that
lived in the other room.

00:57:34.745 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that put
all of these up for us.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And he downloads
different light languages.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So he--

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Light languages?

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:43.540 align:middle line:90%
What's a light language?

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what a
light language is.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't?

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like they're kind of
universal languages merged from

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.780 align:middle line:84%
different extraterrestrials,
sometimes angelic,

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.495 align:middle line:90%
like different civilizations.

00:57:55.495 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like a
universal language using

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:03.220 align:middle line:84%
symbology, sometimes maybe even
those archetypal Sirian symbols

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.020 align:middle line:90%
that I send.

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It's more of, instead of--
it's not necessarily like--

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:12.620 align:middle line:84%
it's language, but it's the
greater language of existence

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.070 align:middle line:90%
as it comes into the physical.

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So maybe some of those symbols
that people describe they've

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.440 align:middle line:90%
seen on ships, that could be--

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, forms of light
language and, I guess,

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.290 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations when
they didn't do writing or have

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Sirian languages
themselves as well.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just cool how everyone's
making their appointments,

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.080 align:middle line:90%
like that's what I can see.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Like Bashar, in 2009, said--

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:49.790 align:middle line:84%
which I was just out of college,
like in a whole other mindset.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And in 2009, he did a
transmission that said--

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:84%
it was the really intense
one about the hybridization

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.980 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, around
2015 to 2017,

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.820 align:middle line:84%
there will be those
online platforms so

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that when people
have the dreams,

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:06.650 align:middle line:90%
they will wake up and go there.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening to that,
and I'm like, that was me.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm the one that
then created that,

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and you knew that I
was going to do that.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:18.297 align:middle line:90%
And it's just this crazy thing.

00:59:18.297 --> 00:59:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was
mentioned yesterday,

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:24.320 align:middle line:84%
the innocence that
children in general bring,

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.900 align:middle line:90%
you were embodying that.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe that's why you're
doing the work you're doing,

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.562 align:middle line:84%
and everything resonates, and
it's synchronized in that way,

00:59:33.562 --> 00:59:35.020 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
energy it needs.

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:36.315 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So hats off.

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:39.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:59:39.188 --> 00:59:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.993 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:59:40.993 --> 00:59:41.793 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:41.793 --> 00:59:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent, excellent stuff.

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a great
positivity around all that.

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate that
because one of my missions,

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:84%
too, is I've talked
to many abductees who

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:56.623 align:middle line:90%
really take that victim role.

00:59:56.623 --> 00:59:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they're supposed to be,

00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.640 align:middle line:84%
obviously, at that
point in life.

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> But you don't have to.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:05.770 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to be relatable
to the ET community,

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I have to know my
abduction stuff.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't go around
spouting out positivity

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:13.740 align:middle line:84%
about hybrid children
and then be like,

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.810 align:middle line:90%
have fun with your fear.

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:15.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I need to go into that.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So then I went
to Barbara Lamb.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And my dad went.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
After my experience,
then he got regressed

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
like the next few days after.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And my experiences actually
weren't very traumatic,

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.642 align:middle line:90%
like I was kind of--

01:00:32.642 --> 01:00:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I helped them make the kids.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was stuff going on on
the ships like where I really

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
understood, like I really got
the greater context of what

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.775 align:middle line:84%
was happening via some
other incarnations

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that I had remembered
when I was a kid,

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
like my Pleiadian incarnations,
like what Earth was going

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:50.110 align:middle line:90%
through.

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:53.155 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't traumatic because
I had that greater perspective.

01:00:53.155 --> 01:00:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But my dad's were
super traumatic.

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
He was shaken for a few
days after his regression.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, but then I
could have that relatability.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.522 align:middle line:90%
I could see what was going on.

01:01:06.522 --> 01:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of seems like
you're going at it that way,

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.030 align:middle line:90%
like you're kind of--

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:11.867 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I hope I don't get any kind of--

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-oh.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --craziness.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.510 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, I know.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, I'm trying
to get the bigger picture

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
relate, get people.

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've been working
with a lot of people

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
who have fear, not
necessarily with abductions

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
but just even this life,
and trauma with family--

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.145 align:middle line:90%
>> --and even sexual--

01:01:37.145 --> 01:01:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Abuse stuff, yeah.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --abuse stuff.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that this perspective
that I'm getting on reality

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is helping me
coach those people,

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
even though I
haven't consciously,

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%
in my current state of mind--

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, carved in.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> --felt like I've gone
through those experiences.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But at least I can
take a perspective.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I can offer a
perspective, regurgitating

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the information.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But in other ways, I've
used that information

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to help me with just current
and day-to-day events and tasks.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:16.830 align:middle line:90%
So I feel that--

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And I see it working, so
it's not like I'm just

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:19.900 align:middle line:90%
regurgitating a message.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
There's actual-- I do have
context of taking the higher

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
perspective of the
bigger picture,

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.730 align:middle line:90%
not buying into the fear.

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't get lost in the
insanity and the negativity.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Stay-- look at the big picture.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
Constantly look at
the big picture.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
The big picture
helps all that story.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
That's--

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.156 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the only saving
grace to this incarnation--

01:02:44.156 --> 01:02:44.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and--

01:02:44.956 --> 01:02:46.081 align:middle line:90%
>> --is understanding that.

01:02:46.081 --> 01:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Understanding that, and don't
be a victim to your emotions.

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try to
tell people-- empowerment.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Because on so many levels,
not only the victim's side,

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
but that allows you to be
a creator in this reality.

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So then you can
create what you want--

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is what a
lot of us, I think,

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.150 align:middle line:90%
are now coming to terms.

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
We want a place.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
We want a planet
that's clean, and pure,

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and a place for
people to thrive,

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and live happily, and
not be the victim,

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.430 align:middle line:90%
not do that victim role.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.225 align:middle line:90%
>> And so that's--

01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%


01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.722 align:middle line:90%
that's what I wanted to do.

01:03:26.722 --> 01:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
trying to create.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
