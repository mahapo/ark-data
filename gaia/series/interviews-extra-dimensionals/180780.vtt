00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:10%
>> And if you want,
just for a moment,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:10%
you can put your
hands on your heart.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.465 align:middle line:90%
And feel your heart beat.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:41.285 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Anchor there, for this is
where heaven touches Earth.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
create heaven on Earth.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:90%
This is your creation center.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:10%
This is the door
through which we

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:10%
speak with you, through which
you can meet us here and now.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.335 align:middle line:10%
For we are here, dear friend.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And we thank you for
your warm invitation.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:90%
So I have a number of questions.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.258 align:middle line:90%
I'm Rueben, by the way.

00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:90%
You probably already know that.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Noted, yes.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you,
yesterday, for your work.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
doing the actual work.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a question in regard
to, I know we've been talking

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
about Yahyel energy.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And here's our kitty
friend at your feet.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Very welcome, very
synchronistic, as you know.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So we know a lot
about the Yahyel

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
already from other beings,
channels like Ishuwa and Bashar

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and several others.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell us a little
bit about your history,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:10%
your background, the
planet you come from?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:10%
Is the planet named Yahyel?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Or is the civilization
named Yahyel?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The latter.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The civilization?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have a
name for your planet?

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It is premature to share
this information with you now.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And does everyone
in your civilization

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:90%
communicate telepathically?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Or is there an actual--

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mainly, yes.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Mainly, OK.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Though there is
some use of language,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
mainly in a poetic sense,
to shape some thoughts.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But the primarily form of
communication is telepathy?

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's understood that
humanity is moving from third

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:90%
to fourth density.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:10%
What density could we associate
the Yahyel civilization with?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Fourth density,
fifth dimensional.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Fifth dimensional,
fourth density.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So basically, where
humanity is headed?

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Is your civilization also
moving into fifth density?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Slowly, but surely, yes.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you're still in
maybe the beginning phases?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We are behind what you
understand from the Sassani

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
through your channel of
Darrell Anka channeling Bashar.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Bashar, I heard
from the channel, Shaun Swanson,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
channel Ishuwa, that
Bashar had a key role

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
in introducing the Yahyel
to the Earth civilization.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Can you go into more
detail about that?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
The Yahyel civilization
from their beginning,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
were they not informed
of the human race?

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We were aware, but we
were younger, you see?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The Sassani had a
little bit more time

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to establish their own
patterns, you might say.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they were in
a better position

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to introduce us to
you, you understand?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> They have been
observing a little longer.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they could
guide us a little.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Whereas otherwise, if we had
to take it from the start,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, it would have been
a lot to take in, in a sense.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
We are all working
together in this.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of cooperation
between all the hybrids,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:90%
and other races.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And other races.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's our understanding
that the Zeta beings,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Yahyel
is a hybridization

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of human and Zetas.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:90%
We do mix.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Is there other energies?

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, of course, the
human DNA is so vast.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, you have
all of those relations.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:10%
But was there more than just
human, more than just Zeta DNA?

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Since you contain--

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:10%
in your here and now time--

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:10%
so many kinds of DNA, so many
strands of interstellar DNA,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:10%
some of us are a composition
of, you could say,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:10%
human DNA that has a
leaning towards more

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:10%
Pleiadian, for instance, or
leaning towards more Sirian.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you can see
as differences between us.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Some of us lean more to the
one or the other as well--

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.363 align:middle line:10%
a little bit more obvious,
there's more playing around.

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Playing around, in
the sense that there's--

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>> You would see the Pleiadian
shimmer through, in a sense,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:10%
or the Sirian, or
any other topic.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.295 align:middle line:84%
>> We've talked about in past,
with other races and other

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:84%
beings I've interacted
with, I've talked about sort

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:90%
of a triad of energy.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know the Sassani,
human, Sirian create a triad.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Would the Yahyel be
Yahyel, human, Pleiadian?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:10%
>> This is what I focus
on personally a lot.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:10%
There are more triads, though.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:10%
>> For a triad.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Also, Sirian
is involved here.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened to
our Zeta parents--

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:90%
your Zeta parents?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
In the sense, I know
we're 1/2 of that.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But is there still
communication with Zeta beings?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:10%
>> That future timeline
also splits up in multiple

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:10%
possibilities.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.267 align:middle line:90%
Could we go into that?

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard one version
where the Zetas have died off.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've heard one version
where the Zetas have evolved.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
They were able to learn from the
human interaction experience.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And their emotional
bodies were reactivated

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
during the
hybridization programs.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And they are thriving in
the galaxy association.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.458 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> There's two examples.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Two examples.

00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's
probably more.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, versions in between,
where they try to activate,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:10%
reactivate their emotional
bodies, but failed.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:10%
And any possibility that you
can think of in between--

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:10%
many, many storylines.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The version of the Yahyel
that I'm interacting right now,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:10%
the Arjun energy, do you guys
have a interaction with any

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:10%
of the Zeta timelines?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I personally do have
some of these relations.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Or, I guess I'm curious,
why did the Sassani come

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
in and say, hey,
this is the story?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
You have human/Zeta DNA.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Why did not the Sassani--

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
or did the Zeta, themselves,
why did they not?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> They have.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> They did come?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
What about future versions
of the human race?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you interact with those?

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:10%
>> We can tune in to that.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:10%
And we sometimes do.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I see.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you have a specific
question about that?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So have you had visitations
from future humans?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Or, should I structure it this
way-- are you future humans?

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:10%
>> You could say both are
happening, in a sense.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:10%
As I consider myself to
be a future version--

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:10%
in a sense-- of the channel
sitting in front of you,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:10%
we are also visiting
humanity in the future, what

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:10%
you could call, quote
unquote, "after your shift".

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Although there is no
end, in that sense, to it.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:10%
This is a continuous process.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:10%
>> And continues evolution.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:10%
>> But yes, we connect
with that new Earth.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Right, right.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>> We can see, more or
less, where you are heading.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's obviously
infinite possibilities

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of time it
takes for us to get there

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:90%
collectively, individually.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I can sort of see it myself,
this new Earth, new form.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>> --where you will find that
what you create for yourself

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:10%
individually is the
collective part,

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:10%
is a part of what you create
for yourself, individually.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:10%
You will create
the collective that

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:10%
fits your personal evolution
with that, to go with that.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:10%
You see?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:10%
>> So there is a lot
more layers to it.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
just now coming

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to understand the terms
and these understandings.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
These conversations are
helping tremendously

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
for myself and others
watching to really grasp.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:10%
>> --to feel into it deeper.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:10%
>> --to feel into deeper, and
to grasp what reality truly is.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's so vast.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:10%
>> And beyond the grasping,
there will be a surrender,

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:10%
a falling into it.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>> A surrender, exactly.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.382 align:middle line:10%
>> And no longer a need
for grasping, really.

00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:10%
>> --a need to
figure it out, yeah.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I like to figure
out everything, though.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It is a perfect step
to come to the surrender.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And you can, of course,
keep on playing with this.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:10%
There is so much fun in
the discovery of everything

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:10%
that is.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm doing this.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And we think so too.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's been said that humanity
is the sixth hybrid race.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The hybrid children.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.367 align:middle line:84%
>> So the hybrid children,
are they the sixth race?

00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The precursors of that.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.548 align:middle line:10%
>> The precursors.

00:12:34.548 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:10%
>> They're bridging that.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:10%
They're kickstarting
that for you.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So once they start
interacting with us

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:10%
in the physical sense here on
Earth through our interactions

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:10%
with them, through our
reproduction with creating

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:10%
offspring, that will
create a new DNA strand?

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In a sense, it is a
little bit more loose.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
in that you have already also
begun becoming this sixth

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:90%
hybrid race.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they are holding
such a high frequency,

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:84%
they will be the highest
frequency-dense form

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of that coming to your Earth.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But understand that when they
do set foot on your planet,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
some of you will be
of the same frequency.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
couldn't allow that in.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We wouldn't be
able to interact.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It will match with some of
you already here right now.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:10%
So you are moving into
it very organically.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of your family
lines have been

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
interacting, having interstellar
interaction for some while,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:90%
being--

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
in a sense-- guided
into that direction.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Already in the
womb, you could say.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And this was your co-creation.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%
You've all been a part of this.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Those who have--

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:10%
>> --chosen.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>> --chosen to go
into that new wave.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which I have
gotten-- through my downloads--

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:90%
that I'm part of this--

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> You are.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --lineage, or guide.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Or, I would use the
word manipulation,

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
but that, I guess, has
a negative context.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>> We would like choice.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, choice.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> For you knew what you were
signing up for, in a sense.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, still, it
was an open agreement.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So my lineage, my mother?

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I feel I had gotten, in my
past, that my mother had

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
some engineering done to her
DNA to allow me to come through.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Funny way to put it.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, correct.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure it goes
further beyond that.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:10%
>> And your grandmother.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Grandmother.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:10%
>> And before.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>> And before.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Very subtle.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:10%
The image I got
during a meditation

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:10%
was, it was just like
minute percentages.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:10%
Because if it was too--

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.665 align:middle line:10%
>> It would not have
succeeded in that time frame.

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:10%
It couldn't hold.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The frequency
wouldn't hold it.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:10%
So it had to be
done very gently.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And then, maybe
this generation,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:10%
but the next generation--
it's almost exponential.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Think of your Fibonacci
spiral, and you've got it.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So would that be the correct
mathematical formula, then,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
if I were to calculate
the exact percentages?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> For on your Earth
planet, this is the guiding

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
mathematical equation
that you develop by.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:10%
Speaking of the hybrids--

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:10%
to go in a little more detail,
the sixth hybrid race--

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:10%
it said that the Yahyel are sort
of the keepers of this race.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Was this a contract?

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:84%
When did this
contract take place?

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I guess, why aren't the
Zetas keeping this race?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:10%
Why did they leave them in
the Yahyel's caretaking?

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> For they had, in a sense,
handed the stick to us?

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We are of a
frequency from birth.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That is what you have all signed
up for, to experience more of.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We are, in that sense,
the perfect guides.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The logical-- the
most logical link--

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
closest to where you are
heading in your next step.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:10%
So where the Zetas,
themselves, quite far

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.830 align:middle line:10%
from that frequency spectrum?

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were focusing more
on the completion of the five

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
hybrid races, as you
have come to understand,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.505 align:middle line:84%
were resulting
from their project.

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do all the children, are all
of them under the caretaking

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Yahyel?

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Or are there some--

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Most are.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Most?

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us the names of
some of the other hybrid races?

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Will you have
interaction with them?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Understand that these
children travel too.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They go out and stay over--
have sleepovers with friends,

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%
you could say--

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
from Sassani and other races--

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian as well, Sirians.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.595 align:middle line:90%
They travel around.

00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
They have seen a
lot of the universe

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
come and visit you.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's why they're the
best bridges to our cosmic

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:10%
families.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I see, because not only
are they made of the same DNA

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
as us, but they've also
been educated quite well.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And they can teach
you quite a bit.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> For humans, I
guess we'll get there.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But the traditional
perspective from a parent

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
is that the parents
teach the kids,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:90%
not the kids teach the parents.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the old paradigm.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:10%
But we're breaking
that, I suppose.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That is shifting already.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Your kids right now are
very strong messengers.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, they are.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And all we have to do is listen.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> --and not give
them pharmaceuticals.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.592 align:middle line:90%
>> For instance, in some cases.

00:19:04.592 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in some cases.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:10%
Yesterday, during
the meditation,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:10%
we connected to two
of my hybrid children.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Are they around?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Having fun in the labyrinths.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I look over to
the labyrinth to my left.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> There's your clover boy.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:84%
He's playing in
the clover circle.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Excellent, excellent.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:10%
This area in Sedona
has been said

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:10%
to be one of the first areas
for these hybrid children

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.302 align:middle line:10%
to come through.

00:19:42.302 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that still the case?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:10%
And maybe, could you explain
the reasoning for that?

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
The circumstances are optimal.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
The veil is so thin here.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.123 align:middle line:84%
It is an easy playing
ground because of the amount

00:20:04.123 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:90%
of crystals in the ground.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
There is a big focusing
here, a big prism.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of energies can
travel through the vortices

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that are present here on
this place on your planet.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:90%
There are more such places.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It is very easy to tune
in with the children,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and for the children
to travel to you

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in a more conscious manner
for you to perceive.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is correct.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:10%
>> An interdimensional highway?

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:10%
>> --so to say.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:10%
Other places-- Brigitte,
who lives right over there,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:10%
is doing amazing work
with the children.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>> She is.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've sort of been doing
work with the hybrid children

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and with my own meditations.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And I got-- it's funny
again, why we're being guided

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
to the labyrinth--

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I've got that the labyrinth,
the energy behind labyrinths

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and communities who
build labyrinths

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
in their communities
and their yards,

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
actually create some
sort of a portal to allow

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:90%
the children to come through.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Can you say anything about this?

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the labyrinths that
are old and have been in use

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
by many spiritual paths-- you
could say, on your planet--

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:90%
are based on sacred principles.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They contain certain
ingredients that universally

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
reflect a pathway to the heart,
the center being the heart--

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
traveling through either
the chakra system,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
or in another way, through
yourself into your own core,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:90%
into your own center.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It is so much that frequency
that the children reach you on,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, they happily
make use of such doorways

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
that you specially
create on your planet.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's because of
the playful energy,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:10%
mixed with the heart
centeredness, mixed with--

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:10%
before, I got the labyrinth
creates a movement going

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:10%
in opposite directions.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> As you seek within,
you discover outside.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
You expand as you move within.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of these energies
that go into the labyrinth,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that's a resonant
frequency for the children?

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's easy for them to move
through that, and to you.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It can be seen as
such a doorway.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
They do love to play
with labyrinths.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.525 align:middle line:84%
>> And they like
cooking with you.

00:23:04.525 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> They like cooking?

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They like
gardening experiment.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are preparing
your food with love,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:90%
they love to be there with you.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:84%
You can think of them as
you consume one of your--

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:90%
for instance-- organic apples.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And share with them your
taste sensation, in a sense,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:90%
by inviting them in.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll get a hint
of that flavor.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:90%
It's fun for them.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You can play with
them in so many ways.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
While you are doing the dishes,
this is hilarious to them.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
that you can call them

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in with situations
that you call everyday,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that are brand new to
them, and so much fun.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:10%
So I take it there's not
a whole lot a dishwashing

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:10%
in and the Yahyel realities.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
There is playing
with bubbles, though.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Playing with bubbles?

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Like soap bubbles
with soap substance?

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Bubbles of a
more energetic kind.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, similar in the idea
of how you perceive them.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.934 align:middle line:10%
>> In the way you
see the time now,

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:10%
how long before we see our
hybrid children interacting

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:10%
with us on a physical sense?

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, this is
completely individual.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of you on your planet have
already physically interacted

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:90%
with their hybrid children.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, that thank
you for clarifying.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.995 align:middle line:10%
That's sort of where I wanted to
go with the question, and ask,

00:24:50.995 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:10%
are there individuals that
are actually already--

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:10%
>> --have seen them.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --have seen them.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes, even
touched them for a moment.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Yet, this was still slightly
in an overlap reality that

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
was brought down to your
planet, you could say.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So you could walk
into it, or they

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
could walk into it within their
own premises, or living room,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or where they were at that
moment in nature more often.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:10%
>> And the more we step
into the higher frequencies,

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:10%
these playful energies, then
these personal interactions

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:10%
will increase?

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> As you play with
your own inner child,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:90%
you open the doors for them.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:10%
So once again,
going back to what

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:10%
we were speaking about
earlier, this global mass bam,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:10%
all the kids are here one day.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:10%
That's not necessarily
how it's going to happen.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:10%
It's going to happen
on an individual basis.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:10%
And then eventually, we'll
hit that turning point,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:10%
as we did after 2012, or
where in time, oh, yeah.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:90%
We have hybrid kids here.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There are more people who
will be invited to open up

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:90%
to that high tier.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:90%
But they still do not have to.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
For some people, this may
still seem rather awkward,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
already happening

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
at the horizon of their
creation of reality.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Other ones will feel drawn
in by it, attracted by it,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:90%
like a fly to honey.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's said
that the Yahyel--

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
well, the hybrid
children, the Yahyel--

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:84%
are so closely related to
us, that they might be--

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
high probability-- one of
the first contact races

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Highest probability, yes.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Highest.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Currently.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We had the Phoenix
lights event, which--

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:90%
thank you for that event.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you enjoy the show?

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I was not there in Phoenix.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.562 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.562 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> The recording of it.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The recording and
the testimonies and all

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
of the people who I've
interacted with who got

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to experience it.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> The show is still going on.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And the show
is still going on.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I heard 2017, there
might be a good chance

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
for the Yahyel, another Phoenix
light-type event to happen.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Is this still in the works?

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> More drawings are
planned in the sky, yes.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:10%
>> More drawings in the sky?

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:10%
We are drawing with our lights.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:10%
>> So the Phoenix lights
was an intentional event,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:10%
an intentional event to wake
up humanity a little bit?

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:10%
Or just to dangle a carrot?

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:10%
How would you describe the
intention behind this event?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.315 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no, in
that sense, target.

00:27:59.315 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We were just saying hi.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And as the timing was
perfect for that in that moment,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances were perfect
for that in that moment.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Many of you had signed up for
such an experience, consciously

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:90%
or subconsciously.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
For us, it was
interesting to see

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
how such a event would be
processed by you, a feeling

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:90%
into the state.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:10%
And many people speculate
now-- researchers in my field,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:10%
in the Ufology field, that
if another Phoenix-like type

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:10%
event would occur, that it would
be a much different situation.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Because now we
have the internet.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has high definition
cameras on their cell phones

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:90%
in their pockets.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be less likely
to be suppressed and hidden

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
for so long.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it would
almost be impossible

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
for it to be hidden
and suppressed.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, still, everybody would
be free to make up their own

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
mind about it.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:10%
>> For your ships, are they
built out of materials that we

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:10%
would know here on Earth?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:10%
Or is it specific to materials--

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:10%
I guess, how are
your ships built?

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it materialistically
carbon-based,

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.323 align:middle line:90%
crystalline-based?

00:29:38.323 --> 00:29:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe your ships?

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> We consider it natural.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it is very strong, yet,
light energetic material.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:90%
We create it energetically.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's not something you
would go and mine a planet

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:10%
to harvest materials, in
the sense that when we build

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:10%
our houses, we go dig up
the ground and get different

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:10%
materials, in that sense?

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> This is focused into being.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's focused into being.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.690 align:middle line:10%
So you literally can--

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:10%
>> --create a ship, or
co-create a ship together.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Through your imagination?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, by bundling the powers,
overlapping them, and thus,

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:10%
densifying them--
materializing our intent.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:10%
>> In a way a sword-maker
would take a hammer and put it

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:10%
in the fire and constantly
fold the sword over and over,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:10%
we call it sword-making
by folding it.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:84%
You just simply do
this with intention?

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Nice analogy.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:10%
You fold the intention on top.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And thus, it becomes manifest.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.342 align:middle line:10%
>> Physical.

00:30:47.342 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:10%
Do you do the same with
the building structures

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:10%
on your planet?

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:10%
Or is that more of
a natural process?

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:10%
>> That is closer to you, as
you are used to playing with

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:10%
nature.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And harmonizing
with nature to do this?

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Although intent is always
a part of everything we do.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you still work with your
planet to build these ships?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So, your question is, do we
build the ships on the planet?

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We can focus
them in the cosmos,

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
if we would want that to.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Depends on where
we gather to do this.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and it's just through
collective intention?

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the number of
beings with your civilization.

00:31:36.053 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you interact with
other civilizations

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:90%
to build your ships?

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So we can say it's
pure Yahyel technology,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:10%
which would be Yahyel intention.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But we do hitch a ride now
and then with each other.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Like taking a ride in a--

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleiadian ship.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> A Pleiadian ship.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Or, the other way around.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Or, join the Sassani.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:10%
We can visit each other
and take a ride along,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:10%
if it is in
everybody's interest.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And do you share
technologies, in that sense,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
with other civilizations?

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> When we do share a
ship, we are of one mind,

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.520 align:middle line:90%
as in where the ship is going.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there is one
or a small group

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:90%
in charge of the specific ship.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Being the ones closest to
it, energetically steering it--

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:38.650 align:middle line:84%
although we are all of one mind
when it comes to the location

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.170 align:middle line:84%
where we are going, that
we are aiming for it.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:90%
We are one heart.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You fly in ships to get
you from one place to another.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the state
of your evolution,

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
need the ships.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you could say that.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We still use the ships
for some reasons.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we
do not need them

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:90%
because we can just tune in.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've heard you
say on your planet,

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.380 align:middle line:84%
there's not a whole lot of
development as far as, like,

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:84%
city structures,
how we have them.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Little.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:84%
There are some, what we
would call play areas, where

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:84%
there is more
structures being built,

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:90%
or have been created there.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that out of choice to
let the planet express itself

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:90%
with little outside influence?

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Through nature, in
the natural way, yes.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there is a lot of art and
artistic, playful expression

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:84%
going on amongst us
in our civilization.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> On the planet?

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And in these areas
of populated areas,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
it's more for our purposes?

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And to explore and play
with nature, in a sense,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
much like the area that
you are in right now.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Sedona.

00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Sedona's a great example.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Referring to the
circles on the ground.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:90%
Creating--

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Art with what is natural.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> With the natural, yes.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And that can be
in shapes like this.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:10%
It can be in ways of planting
the seeds, the flowers,

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:10%
the trees up onto how we
create some of the buildings,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:10%
you would call it.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>> So much like maybe our native
cultures created clay houses

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:10%
using Earth materials--

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything, obviously,
on Earth is Earth materials.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:10%
But with less of a
mixing and matching

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:10%
of chemicals and things.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:90%
>> No chemicals at all are used.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> More of a natural-based--

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And we play with aesthetics.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We like to have plants
growing from bowls and roofs.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:90%
We like to--

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Plants growing from bones?

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Bowls.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, bowls.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Bowls and roofs.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:90%
So that building is alive.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Your house can
bloom, quite literally.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We know through Einstein's
theory of relativity that every

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:84%
star and every planet revolving
around that star sort of has

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:84%
its own relative time
and space to each star.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So the way we perceive
time would not be

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:90%
the same way you perceive time.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure, through
your evolution,

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:10%
you perceive time even
on a grander scale.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, if you were
still in the third density,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
was there ever a time when
the Yahyel civilization was

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:90%
in third density?

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> No, OK.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So from your birth, you birthed
into fourth density conscious?

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But we are familiar
with as much as we

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
can be familiar with
your perception of time

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
through parallel
versions of ourselves,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%
such as the child before you.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would be hard
for us to relate to you at all,

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.500 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:30.010 align:middle line:10%
So this new perception of time--
and this is a new perception

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:10%
that humanity is adapting
through its exploration

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:10%
into science and
physics, metaphysics,

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:10%
and to interactions like these--

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.475 align:middle line:10%
>> And through your hearts.

00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:43.642 align:middle line:90%
>> --and through our hearts.

00:36:43.642 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> From time to timing.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Time to timing.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Then our constructs are
constructs of the universe.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And how we perceive
it shift and change.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll loosen up greatly.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And we, with that loosening,
allows us to connect more

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.870 align:middle line:90%
in this manner.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, and to plug into
more levels of existence,

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:10%
you could say.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's where we enter
into higher dimensional spaces?

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Many of them will become
a lot closer to you,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
easier to reach for, in a
sense, to tap into, tune into.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Going into the fifth
dimension, for example,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:10%
where you reside--

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.520 align:middle line:10%
fourth density,
fifth dimension--

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:10%
right now, we're
fourth dimension,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.120 align:middle line:10%
third and fourth density.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:10%
But are there
humans on our planet

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:10%
that can sort of step in and
out of the fifth dimension?

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have to be fourth
density consciousness

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:90%
to experience fifth dimension?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you still be third
density and travel

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.027 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension?

00:38:01.027 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are fourth
density consciousness,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:84%
you are experiencing
fifth dimensional reality.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are third
density, fourth dimensional,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
you have the possibility
to move in and out of that.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
fifth dimension

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, or
several hours, and even

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.520 align:middle line:90%
feel like these hours have lost.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The Zeta beings that did the
hybridization programs, when

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they started, were
they third density,

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
or were they already
fourth density?

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> When they started?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:10%
>> When they started the
hybridization programs,

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:10%
mixing their DNA with human DNA,
were they already in a fourth

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.390 align:middle line:10%
density consciousness?

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:10%
Or a similar third
density that we were in.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>> They were there.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:90%
It had a different color.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say there,
you mean fourth density?

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:23.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yet I didn't steer
it through the heart.

00:39:23.275 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So, freely translated, we would
say it had a different color.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It was very differently
perceived by them.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:39.285 align:middle line:84%
You are now agreeing to walk
into it through the heart.

00:39:39.285 --> 00:39:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Another path is a
path of resistance.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They tried the
path of resistance.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Yet, their frequency
was rising, thus,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
urging them to
look at themselves

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and rearrange their thinking.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:90%
They had cornered themselves.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The path that they had
chosen for the heart energy

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
is necessary to move on on that
higher and higher frequency.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
At some point, you will
be pointed to that.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It was pointed out to them,
that this wasn't going anywhere.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And within that
realization, they

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:84%
understood they had
to take certain steps,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.090 align:middle line:90%
change their ways.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:10%
>> And if we want to interact
with those flavors, then--

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:10%
for example, if you wanted to
go into the draconian flavor,

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:10%
then we may need to activate
our mental bodies a little bit

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:10%
more.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:10%
If we want to go
into the Pleiadian,

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:10%
the Yahyel flavor, then
we go into our hearts.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Still, these are
generalizations.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Generalizations.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> But yes, in general.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Although draconian
energy has also

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.655 align:middle line:84%
got the flavor that you
call the hard one in it,

00:41:10.655 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:90%
in its own spectrum.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And Pleiadian has been
traveling through quite

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:84%
some resisting eras in
their own timelines.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Do Yahyel have much interaction
with draconians-- dracos,

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:90%
or other reptilian beings?

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Some.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> How do they perceive them?

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The ones that we interact
with are very playful

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and walking along the
same lines, you might say,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can play together,
explore together.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The other ones, we observe
from a distance now and then.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We are not necessarily
looking for the contrast,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:90%
in that sense.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We know it's there,
and that is perfect.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:10%
>> By interacting with humans,
because there's a large portion

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.505 align:middle line:10%
of humanity that is influenced
in sort of along that draconian

00:42:11.505 --> 00:42:12.305 align:middle line:10%
flavor--

00:42:12.305 --> 00:42:14.958 align:middle line:10%


00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:17.000 align:middle line:10%
>> You have a pinch of
that in your systems, yes.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we do.

00:42:18.965 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Just a pinch.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But we've been
choosing to explore

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that for quite several millennia
now, to explore that pinch.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It has added greatly to
your journey and sped up a lot

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.695 align:middle line:90%
of exploration.

00:42:32.695 --> 00:42:33.495 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:33.495 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I see-- I see.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of work with
sacred plant medicines.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be very good
teachers of what we were just

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> They can be for some people.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> For some people, yes.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess, used with
that intention

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and understanding to really--

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And even if it is part of
your path that you laid out

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.870 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, because there
are those that have agreed--

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
you could say-- before
birth, to definitely

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:90%
not use these teachers.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though they have
the right intention,

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.410 align:middle line:90%
they may try to work with it.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And it may just simply
not work out for them,

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
because they have chosen, on
another level, another route

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.626 align:middle line:90%
of learning for themselves.

00:43:23.626 --> 00:43:24.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:24.426 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just one
path of many paths.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I know this might be
a strange question.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think I almost
know the answer.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.177 align:middle line:84%
>> There are no
strange questions.

00:43:36.177 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But for our audience,
is there that kind of work

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:90%
on your planet?

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Is there an actual
external substance,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:84%
like a mushroom
or a cactus, or--

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.790 align:middle line:84%
we have ayahuasca-- that
your planetary civilization

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.425 align:middle line:84%
could work with
that consciousness

00:43:57.425 --> 00:43:58.550 align:middle line:90%
and consume it in that way?

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just
unique to the Earth?

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That is not
unique to the Earth.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We play around
with certain things

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:90%
that are natural to our planet.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:84%
There is still journeying, in
that sense, playing around.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it comes a lot more
subtle, you might say.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> For most of you, this
jump is still a rather big.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The jump with the
medicines, you mean?

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The portal that you move
through appears rather big.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When we consume
these medicines?

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:90%
To us, it feels a little closer.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Still making a trip--

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> But not an extreme.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.900 align:middle line:84%
For some people, the journey
can be quite extreme.

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But that is only because you
are taking your first steps

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:90%
into this.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And some of you are very brave
people taking very big steps.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But you never take steps
bigger than you can handle.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I have come to
that understanding.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> To give you an example, we
can even play with what you

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:84%
could call one
petal of a flower--

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
hold it, tune into it,
and travel on that.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It is a lot more subtle.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And as we become more
in tune on this planet,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:84%
then we can probably
do the same with--

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of you
already can, and do--

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --with a petal of a
flower, a rock, a tree?

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> As Bashar would say,
everything is a permission

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.130 align:middle line:90%
slip.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is very direct
conversation with your earth

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.140 align:middle line:90%
crystal--

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystals as well.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --is possible, and is already
being done by some of you.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> For these plant medicines,
I perceive them as entities

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.880 align:middle line:84%
in themselves,
consciousness, spirits.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We have many names in
our native cultures--

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Pachamama, the
Mother Earth spirit.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, specifically talking
about ayahuasca in this sense.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys interact with
those kinds of spirits?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> We travel with them.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> With them.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.370 align:middle line:10%
>> We see it a
little bit like, say,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:21.320 align:middle line:10%
one plant medicine having a
group over soul, in a sense,

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:10%
that works together with your
Gaia that is being translated

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.410 align:middle line:10%
through that particular
plant medicine.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It is that frequency
that we can very easily

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.020 align:middle line:84%
tap into and travel
along with you

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.990 align:middle line:90%
when you are that frequency.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.970 align:middle line:90%
You move to a bit of a--

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Neutral zone.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --where we can meet.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And you guys don't
necessarily need those plants

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:90%
to get to that neutral zone.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't need plants
to get to that zone, no.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And we don't, either.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But for some right now,
it is the easiest way,

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or they have created it to
seem that way for themselves.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that kind of answered.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:90%
That neutral zone.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:07.310 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:84%
A field to meet on that's
safe for everybody.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Again, a hub.

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And outside of our
plant neutral zones,

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.970 align:middle line:84%
are there other energetic
neutral zones that we can

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:90%
play with, dream time, perhaps?

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Creates such a zone,
on multiple levels, yes.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And are dreams--

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Meditation does.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Meditation, OK.

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Music does.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Following your heart does.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.607 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's many ways to
create this platform based

00:47:40.607 --> 00:47:41.690 align:middle line:90%
on the individual journey.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It is within you.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
to tap into it.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming the invitation
is always on the other side.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:84%
If we put it out there, if
we go to the neutral zone

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and we sort of wave our
flag and say, hey, I'm here.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Come meet me--

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You will always
be hurt or perceived.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.560 align:middle line:10%
It depends on where
you are, how you

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:10%
ask it, and your own
contracts, so to speak--

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:18.630 align:middle line:10%
whether we can respond and/or
whether you will hear us.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Usually, there is a response.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Understand that even not
responding can be a response.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain that?

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In some cases, not
responding as to the questioner,

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if there
is no response.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, that serves a goal.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:50.200 align:middle line:84%
For the question, often in
this case, is too insisting.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There is something
depending on it.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> We wouldn't feed that idea.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The expectation for
an answer creates a--

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --dependency.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --a dependency and a--

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --that we do not
wish to confirm.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:84%
We do not wish to build
that illusion with them

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.830 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So we step back and send love.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So we are responding
energetically.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it is up to them to feel
through what they perceive

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to be a silence, and understand
what the actual meaning of that

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:31.590 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and not attach it
to abandonment or other types

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:90%
of negative emotions--

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Rejection.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Rejection.

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> For that is not
happening, ever.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It is their own
invitation for themselves

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to look at these
feelings, if these

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:58.500 align:middle line:84%
come up due to such a silence,
to play with, to overcome.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They are giving themselves
that opportunity,

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.070 align:middle line:90%
which is a beautiful gift.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And we would never want to
stand in the way of that.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, many star seeds--

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.588 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have many labels
for this new energy that's

00:50:11.588 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:84%
coming out of this planet--
star seeds, indigoes,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.505 align:middle line:84%
crystal aligned, children,
rainbow children--

00:50:15.505 --> 00:50:17.910 align:middle line:90%
there's a whole slew of names.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
people feel abandoned

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:84%
by their star families because
of their lack of connectivity

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to some of the harsh
energies on this planet.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And basically, what we're
seeing now is it's almost

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:90%
a lesson for integration.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is a big one.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at yourself.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For their contracts
prior to coming here--

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Trust that you are connected.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.550 align:middle line:10%
You do not need to seek.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:90%
You are connected.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel like no one's
picking up on the other line,

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.590 align:middle line:90%
so to say--

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Try another line.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Try another line.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>> And by that, we mean look at
where you have not been doing

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.250 align:middle line:10%
what you have wanted to
be doing for so long.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.670 align:middle line:90%
We are on that line.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So it is almost the path of
least resistance, in a way.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.250 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work one way,
then just go the other way.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And stop beating
the dead horse.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Going back to our
sacred plant medicine,

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:middle line:84%
specifically with marijuana, is
that a symbiotic relationship

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that we have with this plant?

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have, in a
sense, with everything

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.215 align:middle line:90%
that is natural on your planet.

00:51:42.215 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure, sure.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You breathe each other.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.520 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> You are intimately related.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The plants have their own
curiosity towards you.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can play together in
more ways than most of humanity

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:84%
is aware of, up until now,
is you have created this here

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and now on this
version of your planet.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Even genetically
and DNA-wise?

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You can play with each other.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.730 align:middle line:84%
DNA is the transmitter,
the receiver on both ends.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.050 align:middle line:10%
So when you play, that is also--

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Harmonizing?

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I see.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why a plant can
assist you, restore your DNA.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And with your love,
you can quite literally

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:49.270 align:middle line:84%
guide the DNA of the plant
and even create new species.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of our sacred
plant medicines--

00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:01.640 align:middle line:84%
not just the ones used for
shamanistic journeys, but also,

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.280 align:middle line:84%
in healing bodies and
healing the body from cancers

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.000 align:middle line:90%
and other ailments--

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:90%
this is all a dance.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, everything is a dance.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:20.180 align:middle line:84%
That is you creating that
to allowing that reflection

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
to help you harmonize with
yourself, help the plant help

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.350 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And it works both
directions, always.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I think we
forget about the other side,

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.850 align:middle line:90%
just taking from the plants.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But their ask is we
have to give back.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You are remembering the other
half of them, infinity symbol.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Always a give and a take.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The sixth hybrid
race humanity,

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:84%
have we interacted
with ourselves?

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have they come
back into our timeline?

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of you are,
and more and more,

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:09.380 align:middle line:84%
speaking to future versions
of yourselves from my future

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Earth, from the new Earth.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you familiar with the
Rendlesham Forest incident

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.075 align:middle line:90%
in Bent Waters?

00:54:17.075 --> 00:54:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:24.483 align:middle line:84%
It's a famous UFO
sort of event where

00:54:24.483 --> 00:54:26.900 align:middle line:84%
several military personnel,
over the course of three days,

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.990 align:middle line:90%
interacted with a craft.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Was that interaction from
future sixth hybrid race humans?

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The airmen themselves felt it
wasn't extraterrestrial per se,

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:43.672 align:middle line:84%
but they always felt it was
us from the future-- humanity,

00:54:43.672 --> 00:54:44.630 align:middle line:90%
humans from the future.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There was both energies
present, hybrid and human.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, it is from
a time frame where

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:84%
they were interacting, closely
working together, traveling

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.150 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And this may help
with the information.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
secret nuclear base.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.690 align:middle line:84%
People felt that
the interaction were

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
sort of warning
and maybe checking

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:13.710 align:middle line:84%
on those weapons of
mass destruction.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.452 align:middle line:84%
They came to show their
faces for a reason.

00:55:17.452 --> 00:55:18.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Because this base was
familiar with tests being done

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:35.710 align:middle line:10%
before, and interfered
with on purpose.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:45.160 align:middle line:84%
In this case, they were
considering certain steps

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in that direction
of certain tests.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And the ship was sent to
interact with some of them

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to show them, we also see you.

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:58.550 align:middle line:90%
They're not alone.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:55:59.823 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And this has happened.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they love themselves
too much to play with matches

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.990 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.450 align:middle line:10%
And this is sort of the
story since the 1940s,

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:16.230 align:middle line:10%
since the kids started
playing with matches,

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:20.450 align:middle line:10%
with the first atomic test
in White Sands, New Mexico?

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.520 align:middle line:10%
Let's say, that there is
a timeline in which you

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.780 align:middle line:10%
could merrily go along that
way of playing with matches.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And we all got to see
where that will lead you.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So we travel back
a little to offer you,

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to co-create with you new
possibility for the future,

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.663 align:middle line:90%
as you understand it to be.

00:56:49.663 --> 00:56:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what were
playing out right now.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.080 align:middle line:90%
You have crossed the threshold.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.060 align:middle line:10%
You have already decided
that you would not

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:03.660 align:middle line:10%
destroy your Earth with that
specific tool in that sense.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:10%
You have already agreed
upon that on a higher level,

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:12.260 align:middle line:10%
as the humanity that is present
on this version of planet

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.750 align:middle line:10%
right here, right now.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was the
2012 marking point?

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Before, even.

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, before.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Harmonic convergence in
1987, would that be--

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Closer, yes.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --one of those marker points?

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Closer to that year.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Although, again, we can't
pinpoint exactly, for this

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is organic.

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:39.218 align:middle line:90%
>> All numbers in that sense.

00:57:39.218 --> 00:57:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, your 2012 date are
more or less symbolic.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people were already beyond
that in their own evolution,

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.020 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's more of a general
guideline for the collective.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And every individual is going
to vary from that point.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> For that tipping of
the scales moment that you

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:12.590 align:middle line:84%
understand as your
2012 December,

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.220 align:middle line:84%
was created by all of those
people that had already tipped

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.620 align:middle line:90%
at that point, you see.

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They had become such
a group that they

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.330 align:middle line:84%
could tip the scale for the
rest of the planet, in a sense.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in their
experience of reality,

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:35.250 align:middle line:84%
already manifested
that for themselves.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They were already experiencing
slightly more positive

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:43.070 align:middle line:84%
than negative energies
for themselves.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.140 align:middle line:84%
They helped tip the
scale for the majority.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So you could all tap into
that easily, quicker, faster.

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And the more individuals who
create that perception, then

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.280 align:middle line:90%
create that reality.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Nailed it.

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Then go into that timeline
where those nasty things

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:04.510 align:middle line:90%
don't exist.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Where you can
celebrate together,

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that all those nasty things
have brought you where you are

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.550 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Because you transformed it.

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You integrated it.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.210 align:middle line:84%
You stopped basically
calling them nasty.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And for those nasty
events that keep

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:29.090 align:middle line:84%
occurring in other people's
lives, in a global sense,

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:35.660 align:middle line:84%
then it's just a reflection
for those individuals

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:41.090 align:middle line:84%
for those people to make
a shift in their lives.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> They are still on their
own route of exploration,

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.900 align:middle line:90%
still playing with these things.

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you can perceive
that, bits and pieces of you--

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.090 align:middle line:84%
although there is
only one whole--

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:57.180 align:middle line:84%
are still causing that
reflection for you to perceive.

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
that, it tells you

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.210 align:middle line:84%
it is still somewhat
active in you.

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you perceive
them playing that game,

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:13.070 align:middle line:84%
you can heal that within your,
transform it for both of you.

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether they choose to accept
that gift or not is up to them,

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:20.690 align:middle line:90%
you see.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, so that's the
construct here on Earth.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I'm trying to use
that same micro as the macro.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
If you guys are perceiving Earth
in that way, in that sense,

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
then I perceive the other
side the world in their thing.

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:46.466 align:middle line:84%
Is it a similar type perspective
where you see Earth--

01:00:46.466 --> 01:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and again, I hate
to use these words.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can find better
words-- this needing to heal?

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We observe it full of trust.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Trust, OK.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing that every being on
that version of Earth that we

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
look at has its own individual
path and free choice to work

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
with what they have manifested
for themselves to work with,

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
in whatever way they wish
to in any given moment,

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
starting by their
outlook on life,

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
their inner response
to circumstances.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
For as long as
they perceive them

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
as being outside
of themselves, this

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is the first step
to bringing them in

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
to change their response to it.

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
This free choice is always
available for all of you,

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
no matter how dire, how
challenging circumstances

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.700 align:middle line:90%
may look.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
When we look at a planet full
of people with that free choice,

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
we see incredible
magic unfolding.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Because every single breath
you take, every move you make,

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.790 align:middle line:84%
every person that has
this constant freedom

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is a fairy tale on
its own, influencing

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.480 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the entire planet.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.870 align:middle line:10%
You are creating as
many planets as there

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.950 align:middle line:10%
are people on your planet.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We are just intuitively
flowing with every version

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
of that that resonates with us
enough so we can communicate

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.690 align:middle line:90%
with you as we are now.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Never is there our
choice to feel sorrow.

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Never is there our choice to
feel torn between what we see,

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and what we know.

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.330 align:middle line:90%
There is no conflict there.

01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
There is only the full
embracing of what we observe--

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
seeing the magic that is
always there unfolding.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Even for those that
choose a very narrow path,

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:08.180 align:middle line:90%
there is an artistic thing--

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.900 align:middle line:90%
you could say-- to that as well.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The way we would perceive
to fix the problem

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is really to see that
there is no problem--

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --to fix.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --to fix.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And then by
having that outlook,

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.500 align:middle line:90%
by embracing that energy then--

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Freeing that energy
within your system,

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
by letting go of the idea of
a problem that needs fixing,

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
you will actually allow in a lot
of energy from your own higher

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
self, from your source--

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you could say-- that you can use
to benefit yourself and others

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.020 align:middle line:90%
by letting that flow.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever you
create for yourself

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
the idea of an
obstacle or a problem.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You are blocking that
energy from flowing to you.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you do allow
it to flow in,

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.980 align:middle line:90%
you can benefit the whole more.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I understand that now.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So really-- and I guess I'm
trying to get into the Yahyel

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
head space a little bit--

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart space.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --heart.

01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the correction,
because that's what's needed.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, it's just again,
seeing everything as perfect,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing everything as happening
in the divine way that it does,

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and then just simply
choosing what's

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
in your highest excitement.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more you do that, the
more that is what you manifest.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, unless you choose to
feel something that is a bit

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:43.160 align:middle line:10%
less exciting for you, and
then be OK with that as well.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
See the perfection
in that as well.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you're choosing your
less than highest excitement

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.320 align:middle line:90%
as your highest excitement.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, exactly.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're transforming
it to a higher frequency.

01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So you haven't
fallen off your path.

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:00.060 align:middle line:90%
There is no way to fall off it.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Even the idea of following
your highest excitement

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
brings a lot of
pressure for people,

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
we have discovered
along the way.

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think some people
get caught up in the wording.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Highest.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Highest, yes.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>> There are your levels again.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So we like to put it as to be
as much as you can possibly

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
be of you, in any given moment.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you are you and
being a little sad,

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
embracing that you are a
little sad in that moment

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
helps you move out of it.

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Expressing it, feeling it,
as opposed to stuffing it

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and trying to avoid it and
say, I'm not sad, or whatever.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And say that's not my highest
excitement, so it's not good.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
There is a beauty in
embracing that emotion

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it into
motion, and exploring it

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
as you like to explore
and play with your mind--

01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.220 align:middle line:90%
like you said before.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And figure out where is
this emotion emerging from?

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
What am I believing
to be true that

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
makes me feel this way
right here, right now?

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Be it.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And look at it with open eyes.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't squinch.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you say is
sort of the main philosophy

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Yahyel, the main teaching
that maybe the Yahyel have

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:31.380 align:middle line:90%
for humanity?

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Be here now.

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:36.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Be here now, in this moment.

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are
fully here and now,

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
you are looking
with your eyes open.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
You're perceiving the fullness
of yourself in that moment.

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So if there is anything
within your system

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that is slightly out of
whack, you would notice.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.840 align:middle line:90%
You would feel it.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
You could tune in with your
body and feel it either

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
through your physical
body speaking to you,

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or your emotional body
speaking with you.

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
As everything is always
continuously speaking to you.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Our environment as well.

01:07:07.515 --> 01:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Your environment, a
reflection would be speaking

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
to you.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
fully here and now,

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
you can pick up these
messages and play with them,

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.070 align:middle line:90%
and grow from them.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would say,
expand in our awareness,

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:26.190 align:middle line:90%
our awareness of what is.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --of all that is.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It is all you.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And you can play with all of it.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So the more we're
centered in being here now,

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
we can feel our surroundings.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.990 align:middle line:10%
We can be in tune with
all that there is.

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Less likely for you to miss
a message from your own higher

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
self to yourself, as you
are constantly speaking

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to yourself.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And so are many of your guides.

01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And bring yourself
home by being here now.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the Yahyel,
your civilization,

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
in the daily practice
is to be here now.

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And we see what
comes our way.

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And we pick what resonates most
with us in every given moment.

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:24.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> We think so.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Lots of fun.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I look forward to more
interactions with the Yahyel

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and our hybrid children.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, guys.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.649 align:middle line:90%
>> So do we with all of you.

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And in our lights
in the sky, can't wait.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I'm
very excited and thankful

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
for this this interaction.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We thank you so much
from all of our hearts.

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We have been delighted to
have this interaction with you

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%
here now.

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And we will meet again.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.589 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:09:03.589 --> 01:09:04.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.

01:09:04.489 --> 01:09:05.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.
