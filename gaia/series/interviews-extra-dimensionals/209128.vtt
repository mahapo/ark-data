>> Seven years of trials, and
challenge after challenge after

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
challenge, I mean,
it was relentless.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't a moment of peace.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:10%
The only peace was when I
would take time, forge time

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:10%
out, and go into meditation.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Empty the teacup,
and you know, listen.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Krishna
would come in and start

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
giving me instructions
occasionally,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:90%
when I hit the wall.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:90%

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I was coming up here
every day, like I said,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
picking up the stones,
putting them in place.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
He was guiding it.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:90%
It turned out to be a galaxy.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was so incredibly grateful
for everything that it was--

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
you're going through dark
night of the soul, you know,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You have nowhere.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in
the desert at night,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know the terrain.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And so-- and there's no gravity.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get through all
those challenges, you know?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And he was the light for me.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And so this place here was
such a deep relief for me,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and a point of rejuvenation,
and revitalization,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
and orientation.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a little candle in
the infinite darkness.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would come here
and get my candle lit.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was so grateful
that I decided

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to honor this relationship.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I would put--

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I would line this,
make this a temple.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So I lined the pathway
with all these stones,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%

little piece of it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%

one could use the
metaphor of battle,

that you really hone
who and what you really

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
are because the old
self, the personality,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of the
character, gets chipped away

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:90%

into today because I think

you offer a whole

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%

for our audience, for me.

I've been learning,
going on these journeys,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share some of
that wealth of knowledge

that you have with our audience.

say that some of my spiritual

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
background comes from,
I guess, my grandmother.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
She was a little bit of a seer.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And she could tell-- warn
us kids ahead of time,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
before we had some kind of
an accident or something.

And my mother, she had a
little bit of the gift.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But she was
predominantly Catholic.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't extend
outside of that realm.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
But we could converse on
any of the beings that

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
would come in when we
were going into church.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.543 align:middle line:84%
So like, Mother Mary,
or various other beings

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
would come in, and be like,
hey, do you notice that?

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.168 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, I see
them right there.

00:07:26.168 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, angelic beings?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, like Michael.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And so at a young age, you
were open to the possibilities

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
of another realm, or
other realms, so to say?

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I had a lot
of different experiences.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, my father--

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
we used to live in
Greece, Athens, Greece.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And my father died in a
scuba diving accident.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:90%
He had a heart attack.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So we had to move
back to California.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is when one of
those experiences happened.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was 11 years
old at the time.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was at night.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was in my bed.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
My brother was in
the bunk, yeah,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:90%
in the bunk on the other wall.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And it was about 12:00 at night.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, I was awoken

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
to this luminous white
being that was like an orb.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
But it was pearlescent.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering
over my knees.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
it, just stunned.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, I'm going

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to go wake up my brother
to have him see this.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Brother, I need the
validation, right?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And then when I went to go--

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
about to wake him
up, I just knew

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as I wake him up,
this thing would disappear.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And I would never live it down.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.078 align:middle line:90%
My brother would never--

00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> He'd get upset at
you for waking him up.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right, so I just
stared back at the thing.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at it.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's alive.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's just moving,
scintillating, right there--

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
pearlescent, soft.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember saying
to-- this is weird.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
But I said, I'm not ready yet.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And so it-- the wall was here.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And it turned the wall into
the open sky, night sky.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was just stars
and everything.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And it moved out away.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it kind of
twirled a little bit.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it went out a
little further, almost

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:90%
like it was waving and stuff.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So at an early age, I was
like, oh my god, there's

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
something different out here.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Did you talk to anybody
about that experience?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't share that.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But many different things
occurred when I was younger.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But I would have to say
that around 2006, I was part

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:90%
of a spiritual organization.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was worldwide.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go to Russia
to do facilitator training.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
morning of May 4th.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I like to do my
meditations before I go in

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to teach the class.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing a meditation.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And now, I've never--

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I had respect for Hindu things.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But my only experience
with Hindu things

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
was at Los Angeles Airport,
or an airport in Honolulu,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.183 align:middle line:84%
where they had the Hare
Krishnas, and things like that.

00:10:44.183 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So I didn't really--

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:90%
wasn't attracted to it, so.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I knew nothing
about it, right?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So morning of May 4th, I'm
in meditation in Moscow,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to go get
prepared to go to the class.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So I did the meditation,
and did my meditation.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this being comes.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's just so vivid.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And he announced
himself as Vishnu.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And I went, Vishnu,
as in Lord Vishnu?

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
one and the same.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.387 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:11:21.387 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And he said what?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> The one and the same.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> The one and the same?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Did he have an Indian accent?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No way!

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god, that's great.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't stay
very, very long.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:90%
He went away.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:90%
But I was like, what was that?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, phenomena,
phenomena-- right.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:90%
But the morning--

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait, wait,
phenomena, what is that?

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:42.435 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.945 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In yoga class, our teacher
was one of those that--

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
who was very conscientious
about being mindful and always

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:90%
observe yourself.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
phenomena can come.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Krishna baby
sitting in the bed next to you,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.215 align:middle line:84%
or something lying on the
couch, or something like that--

00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:90%
but just consider it phenomena.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Consider it phenomena, OK.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so that was--

00:12:10.453 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It is that, and
just moving on?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that and nothing--
yeah, move on, and stay mindful.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Stay centered.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Stay-- so anyway, the
next morning, May 5th,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.598 align:middle line:90%
which is the Russian--

00:12:22.598 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
what is it, like
the 4th of July.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I was in meditation
the day before.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I had kind of dusted it
away, forgot about it.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.005 align:middle line:84%
>> But this time, I'm
doing my meditation.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing a little--
couple of bhati breathing,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and stuff little, like,
accelerated breathing.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
And now, this gets crazy.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But this guy pulls up
in a golden chariot.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And he's blue.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, get in.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this in your
meditation, or in real life?

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, but it's so--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Visceral.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> --visceral, that
I'm like, what?

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.995 align:middle line:90%
So I get in with him.

00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:05.795 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The golden chariot.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --we go off-- yes.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And we go off into the--

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.652 align:middle line:90%
it's crazy, right?

00:13:11.652 --> 00:13:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this is a
physical body, right?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, we're
flying towards the East

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:90%
in the chariot.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I'm
looking at this guy.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And he's blue.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this gold bracelet,
arm-let on, bare skin, panche,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.302 align:middle line:90%
golden trousers.

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like you see in
the drawings and stuff,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:90%
the paintings.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but remember,
I know nothing.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than your yoga
teacher saying, phenomena.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, phenomena.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So-- because we were just
beginning the Hatha yoga.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, I was
doing some Daoist yoga

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:90%
for quite a number of years.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, we're flying.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I had asked a
question a couple of weeks

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
before--

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
no, a week before.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It was a very serious question.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
the position I was

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:90%
holding in that organization.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to archangel
Michael, who I knew.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was saying,
you know, Michael,

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want me in
this position, let me know.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You know I'm not
attached to power, right?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.858 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want me out,
just say the word.

00:14:21.858 --> 00:14:23.928 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone, like that, right?

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like you were
looking for a way out.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I was looking for a way out.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're in
this chariot, right?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at this guy.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, who are you?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I'm
going, who are you?

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, he had his
hands on the reins and stuff.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.317 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns
and looks at me.

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I'm Lord--

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I am Krishna.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.755 align:middle line:90%
I go, Lord Krishna?

00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yes,
the one and the same.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I go, the guy yesterday
said that same thing.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, Lord Krishna?

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Is this is Lord
Krishna, shouldn't I

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
be shaking in my boots?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And this guy just felt like
I've known him forever, right?

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, when I'm
like, I know you, he turns.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I need you
to stay a little longer.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
quantum navigation, right?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Little did I know that he was--

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
at that time, I
knew what he meant,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
was that I need to
stay in that position.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But little did I
know, that was going

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%
to lead to enormous hardships.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Hardships?

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Hardships, yeah, just
unbelievable hardships

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:90%
for seven years of--

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.732 align:middle line:90%
hardships, so.

00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you stay in that
organization for seven years?

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> For seven years, yeah.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through just
enormous amounts of-- and man,

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
at that time, you know, I was
just beginning with Hatha yoga.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I had done quite a
number of years of Daoist yoga.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had to
stick with the training.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I started doing my--

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I was doing my meditations.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And he started coming every time
I really was facing the hardest

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:90%
challenge.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And then he began opening up.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And he started communicating.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:10%
I've shared, in
some of the videos,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:10%
about the seven routes
of unconsciousness,

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:10%
and working through a
lot of the shadow work.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, he was the one
that would come and start

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:10%
communicating these things.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:10%
And so over this
seven year period,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:10%
I had to face so many things,
one thing after another-- just

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:10%
impossible challenges and such.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, after
the chariot ride,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out
what the heck was--

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are these people?

00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are these blue people?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I-- my Russian translator,
I knew he was a little bit

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
grounded in Hindu--

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Traditions.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> --traditions.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:90%
And so, you know, I asked him.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And he laid it out for me.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh my god.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that started.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Having these visceral
meditative encounters with

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
these other beings-- you said
Michael, who I already knew.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Is this like, a
common thing that you

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
connect with these
beings so viscerally?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Most of the time.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a period when I was
sensitive to more, like, power

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:90%
spots and energy vortexes.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel when certain
radiant beings were nearby

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
because you get that
real integrated energy.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I tried using
a lot of the techniques

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
from, how do you
open your third eye?

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know-- so I
do all these exercises.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:90%
I could never do it, you know?

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But I found that
going to power spots,

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:90%
it really opened up the heart.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you open the heart
to significant levels,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:84%
then what would happened-- you
moved into such detached things

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that these beings suddenly
started becoming visible.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the third eye
wasn't the way to see.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It was, how vulnerable
can you get?

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
How naked can you
get inside the heart?

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And that opened up my vision.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So you used the power
spots, or these lay lines,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and these types of
things, sacred sites,

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
used the energy from that
to help open the heart?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:90%
That's correct, right.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that triggered the,
sort of, a spineal Kundalini

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
thing?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I started seeing more, yeah.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I already could feel.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, it would open up.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I can see some
of these beings.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time, I could hear.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.598 align:middle line:84%
I found it was easier
to feel and hear.

00:19:28.598 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right, well,
since you opened the door,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
let's go into this work
that you're doing as well,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:90%
with the--

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I call it the gritting
of the planet,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
these lay lines
because you are in tune

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.573 align:middle line:90%
in to these power spots.

00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
it in the past.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.908 align:middle line:90%
You took me to one before.

00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do some
more adventures later.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But how does your work evolve
from just connecting, using

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that for your own
opening now, because you

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
have a whole other modality.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there a name for it, or is it
part of the quantum navigation

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
curriculum?

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Curriculum?

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, curriculum,
how does that work?

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say that I
worked my way towards quantum

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
navigation through working on
power slots, and lay lines,

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
That really attracted
my attention

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
visceral, right?

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was working at
Honeywell Corporation, right?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.522 align:middle line:90%
And you have a lot of stresses.

00:20:38.522 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What were you doing there?

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I was responsible for taking
care of all of the production

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
equipment, from computerized all
the way to electromechanical,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to hydraulic, and
stuff like that.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:90%
So I was Mr. Fixit Guy.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So you pick up
a lot of stresses,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and all of that at work.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dream, at that
time, to work with a group--

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
without going into
the full story,

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say, as soon as--

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in the dream, I was told, as
soon as you can accept it,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
you're to work with the
Great White Brotherhood.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.462 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, what
the heck is that?

00:21:22.462 --> 00:21:23.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Great White, yeah.

00:21:23.337 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And they wouldn't answer.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, well if
you're not going to answer,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
then at least tell me, where
can I learn about this?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, you'll find
your answer at Echo Canyon.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
living in Albuquerque.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And Echo Canyon is
between Sandia Mountain

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and Manzano Mountain.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a canyon in there.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
valleys up in there,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:84%
they have some pretty
lavish homes up there.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Had you been to
Echo Canyon before?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Just passing through, but
I didn't know anybody was up

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But when I went
back to Honeywell,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
a friend of mine.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 80's, you had to
be real selective about who

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
you talked to about spiritual
things or metaphysical kinds

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, I had a friend.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I told her
about this, and asked

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
her, where can I find out any
information about the Great

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:90%
White Brotherhood?

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
well, I don't know.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But my husband,
Henry, he's Indian.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
He knows a whole lot of stuff
about this spiritual area.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you come over.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And you can ask him them.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.332 align:middle line:84%
So I went over and
had dinner with them,

00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and finally got to the point.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Henry,
so Henry, what's

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:90%
this Great White Brotherhood?

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And what came out of his
mouth just stunned me.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I never heard anything
about that before.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- my
jaw hit the ground.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
He was talking
about that there's

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
a consortium of beings that
have mastered the earthly plane.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And they call them
the Ascended Masters.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And these Ascended Masters
go to different planets.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And they help evolve
the consciousness

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
until those beings can
move up into mastery

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
over the physical dimension,
mastery over the self,

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:90%
mastery over consciousness.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say
Ascended Masters,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
would this be like
Saint Germain, and--

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And who else do we
have in that reality?

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Would Metatron or
these guys be--

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes,

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Physical

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --these physicalized angels,
in a sense, who have ascended.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We have, in our
metaphysical lore now,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:90%
we have the Ascended Masters.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.325 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the same thing?

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the Great
White Brotherhood?

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the Great
White Brotherhood.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:90%
So he shared with us--

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
he shared with me
about all of this.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I was--

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I broke my paradigm
right there, you know?

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I got to
think of something quick,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, something
smart to say.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So I said, so Henry,
where can I find out

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:90%
any information about this?

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It was the best thing
I could think of.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So he said, there's
this older Frenchman

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:90%
who lives in Echo Canyon.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.045 align:middle line:84%
And I've sent some
people to him.

00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:90%
He never locks his gate.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not ready,
the gate will be locked.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, oh OK, well,
I'd like to go and see

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
if I can learn more about this.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, physically,
the gate's locked?

00:24:36.697 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, physically, yeah.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.865 align:middle line:84%
>> And if it's not, is
that a sign that it's--

00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not ready.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and he kind of can
tune in to people coming in?

00:24:45.663 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
how that happened.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
That's just what Henry told me.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine what my mind
was going through at the time.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm mortally open.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So anyway, Rebecca,
which was Henry's wife,

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
she took me out there because
she had been going to that

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.263 align:middle line:90%
>> She knew the Frenchman?

00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:06.555 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah, and that's where--

00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:07.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Was the gate locked?

00:25:07.513 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No, the gate was open.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, phew,
passed that test.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I got to tell you, the
more I'm in this, we're like,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
in "The Lord of the Rings."

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:90%
The way this is--

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to hear these stories, and
the stuff I'm going through

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
personally, myself, too,
it's like, literally, yeah,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.767 align:middle line:90%
stories like this.

00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
This is really-- this is like a
fantasy movie we're living in.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah,
imagine at that time--

00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, especially
at that time.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --I was going--

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a wife at that
time, and a newborn son.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So you know, my
world was completely

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
changing from the way
I had been carefree,

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and party here, you know?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I had
to change my life.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:90%
You need to rethink your life.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- so the dream
told you Echo Canyon.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Henry told you Echo Canyon.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's some validation.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And now you're going.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And the door's unlocked.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Where-- what happened to--

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is this Frenchman?

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So we entered into the room.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And the room, very much
like this room here.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The coloring was
quite the same--

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:90%
seated about 24 people.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I'm
the newbie on the block.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:90%
So everybody notices, you know?

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%
So I go in.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it all-- he was
a channeler, 60--

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
at that time, he
was 60 years old.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was a channel
for the Ascended Masters

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
under the I AM movement.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So he studied
with Ray Ballard.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know the lineage.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But Ray Ballard was the one
who brought it from Shasta.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, so yeah,
because the Shasta energy--

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Saint Germain is there.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yeah.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I recently
interviewed Adama from Telos.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of all
hang out in there.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.440 align:middle line:10%
The Galactic Federation,
they're all kind of-- it's

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:10%
like a big party, right?

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's actually
at Panther Meadows,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:10%
for the first time that
I had seen Michael,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:10%
Archangel Michael, was
at Panther Meadows.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah, OK.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.285 align:middle line:10%
>> That did have a
very angelic energy.

00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a lot of-- there's
a lot of ties to there with

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:90%
that organization.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the guy was-- this
was my first time experiencing

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And we would do these cleansing.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:84%
They called them,
cleansing decrees,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:84%
using the violet flame,
or the blue lightning.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So you use thought,
emotion, and words.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So that allowed manifestation,
the condensation

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred rays,
to be used in action.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the first thing
they have you do,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.632 align:middle line:84%
they give you all
these little books.

00:28:03.632 --> 00:28:05.437 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
cleanse yourself.

00:28:05.437 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So you were getting cleansed.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And then you can come back.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
They do have you
do those cleansing

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Techniques?

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.925 align:middle line:90%
>> --decrees, yeah.

00:28:14.925 --> 00:28:15.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Decrees.

00:28:15.725 --> 00:28:16.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Like decrees, yeah.

00:28:16.848 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Spoken words, then,
that they would have you--

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You would do that--

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a chant?

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> They had prayers
that are in it.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's all invoking
the sacred rays.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate,
it's almost like in yoga,

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Dhyana Dharana, as you focus,
then you relax and detach.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And then you can start to feel.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So a person coming
off the street,

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:90%
they start using this material.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
the Dhyana Dharana.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're also invoking
the sacred flame.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So you start to
begin to feel that.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And it helps your sensitivity
to integrated energy,

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:90%
divine energy, and stuff.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I went there
for quite a few years.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We would meet twice
a week, and yeah.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So you were--

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, you were initiated
into the White Brotherhood.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, correct.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously through
Lyssa's work,

00:29:15.477 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:84%
she's already got such a great
breakdown, cosmic anthropology,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
as I like to call it,
or as she calls it.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And then going layers deeper--

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I
found your work really

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
goes extra deep, with
the archetypal energies,

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and bringing those into
this work, and defining,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:84%
as we're giving language
to these other realms.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's been a big help
with my understanding

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:90%
through all this.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very touching.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that's, again,
why I wanted to introduce you

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to this world, my world, my
audience because it is such

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:90%
a big influence.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the direction
we're going with all of this.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
My lens started through my ET
experience, or my UFO sighting,

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and then going deeper and
deeper and deeper with medicine

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.740 align:middle line:84%
journeys, and these kinds
of things, shamanic work,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and then going into,
as you just mentioned,

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the Great White
Brotherhood, and Krishna,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and all of these archetypes.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They're all kind of
working together.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're all unique.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And they have their individual
avatar, or their structure,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:90%
or label.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they're sort of cogs in
the cosmic wheel of ascension,

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to use that
word, but this transformation.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Transformation.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:30:59.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there we go.

00:30:59.785 --> 00:31:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So backing up a little bit
more, I'm a little confused.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Did the Krishna
experience happen

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
before or after the White
Brotherhood experience?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well after.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Well after, OK.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Well after, yeah.

00:31:12.643 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So this White
Brotherhood dream was early

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:90%
on in your development?

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and prior
to the Daoist yoga.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Daoist yoga is really
instrumental in the quantum

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:84%
navigation because it was so--
they don't like to give you

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:90%
any technical stuff.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.660 align:middle line:84%
They just put you in
different postures.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite
was hard training

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because in the hard training,
you went beyond the mind,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.865 align:middle line:84%
beyond the emotions,
beyond the body.

00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:48.665 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> In hard training, like
martial arts training?

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's like staying in
a horse dance for over half

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.480 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's in martial arts.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, yes, true.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:84%
All martial arts will have that
horse dance element in there.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's vital.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the Daoist yoga, the
simple things that they would

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
teach us was about finding
the fine line between the mind

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.493 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
an eye opener.

00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was sort
of your foundation.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's-- yeah, that's the
critical foundation there.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
To be familiar with what
those two elements are

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:90%
was groundbreaking.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:10%
So I have to thank that process,
but also in that same bag,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:10%
the same amount gratitude
would be to my wife

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:10%
and her work with all the
ET's because I had many ET

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And we're a traveler, right?

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We're a traveler in a jungle,
a cornucopia, a jungle.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
very challenging.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's
really liberating.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:90%
But my question was, why?

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And how do you put
all this together?

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I want.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I wanted some kind of scope.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.025 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I want, too.

00:33:27.025 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was four years old,
I'm sitting at the table with

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:90%
my dad.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would always ask my
dad all the-- my dad was

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:90%
the authority.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So I would always ask
him questions, right?

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.910 align:middle line:84%
At four years old
though, I blanked him.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So four-year-old, I'm going,
dad, what are we here for?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So it started at an early age.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out why, why
is this happening, right?

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Your curiosity was
weaponized at four.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well said, well said.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.830 align:middle line:10%
When I met my wife,
it was the first time

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:10%
I met somebody who consciously
was calling them in.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:10%
I was a real skeptic.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.275 align:middle line:84%
>> I was at the point
where I was like,

00:34:16.275 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:90%
do you want to call them in?

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they come
inadvertently to people.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But why do you want
to call them in?

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Was it scary to you, or?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, because that's
a whole different paradigm,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But you've been on
a chariot with Krishna.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That was later.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:39.450 align:middle line:90%
That was later.

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
>> That was later, OK,
all right, all right.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
>> So after working with
Lyssa and having contacts,

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:90%
personal contacts with ETs--

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and they were pretty profound.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you know,
I was asking my soul,

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.890 align:middle line:90%
who are these people?

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:90%
What are these?

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And the answers I
was getting back

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:90%
was, well, they're all you.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I've
been in this work with her

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:90%
for quite a number of years.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And as we were doing a lot
of these contact experiences,

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
they started showing
me, more and more.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got to
putting the yoga together,

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:90%
understanding what--

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:84%
by this time, you know,
Krishna has been showing me

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
quite a lot of different
aspects of consciousness,

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.270 align:middle line:90%
how it all came from the one.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.195 align:middle line:90%
All is one.

00:35:56.195 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:84%
If we had-- this
is a good example.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
If this was the void.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:90%
This was Purusha.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
This was where all
structure occurs.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:90%
And it begins to fractalize.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The moment of
unconsciousness, it shatters.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those
fractals are all you.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And so as this started
happening, you know,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:10%
I started becoming more aware
of each of the species are just

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:10%
another timeline, and iteration,
and timeline, and history.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I started
asking the question, what's

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:90%
all this for?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, when
you get mature enough,

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
it's time to store
it at all back home.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And so quantum navigation
is about understanding

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:84%
what caused all the fractures,
the splits, fractures,

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
dissociations in us, that
cause all of the barriers,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and boundaries, and
separation consciousness?

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we work through the
repeating shadow issues,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we find out, oh, oh, oh,
it's all my projections.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I've seen the work.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it so personalized?

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And for each one of us, is--
there's just many stories.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a way
to sum it up into,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.560 align:middle line:84%
why have we chosen
to fracture ourselves

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:90%
into a million pieces?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this triggers my
heart because these are part

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
of the answers I'm
seeking myself.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:84%
When I go into the quantum, my
soul asks that same question.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Why, why did we have to do this?

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Why do we-- why all this?

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And the best that I
can get at this time

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness
is a continuum.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say continuum,
define continuum.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A continuum has no end in
any of the six directions.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so to wrap the mind
around that is humbling.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no end to the
continuum of consciousness.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so consciousness,
and only consciousness,

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:37.260 align:middle line:84%
can integrate all of the
shadow within itself.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So home for the shadow is
within the consciousness.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So the fractal goes on a
journey of self-discovery

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:84%
until it matures
eventually, and realizes,

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've got to
steward all my splits,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:84%
fractures, dissociation,
back into the unicity, which

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:90%
is right through the heart.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And the best I can get on
this is that consciousness

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:90%
is a being, a beingness state.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're contextualized
for being a doer.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:90%
The character is a doer.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
The history of our being, we've
contextualized in lifetimes

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:90%
after lifetimes, as a doer.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And so in that case,
we can't change

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:84%
who we are until we're ready
to see ourself differently.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So the character, when it
runs up against the quantum,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a shock.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:10%
So literally, the
character is kind of

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:10%
in, like, an egg, in
the inside of an egg.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting used
to 3D, 3D consciousness,

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:84%
how to work with
that reality, how

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand the self from
that kind of a perspective.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And so at one
point, consciousness

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.780 align:middle line:84%
pokes a little hole
through that shell.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind of like a
quantum acupuncture needle.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And it causes us
to pay attention.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we rationalize,
and try to figure it out

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
until we can grok it,
and/or reason it away.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:10%
And then the spirit goes, oh,
time for another acupuncture

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:10%
needle.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And it'll keep doing that
until we're so familiar,

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and we've assimilated the
quantum characteristics

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of our being, that now it's
got the job of disassembling

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
that egg.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's sort of
like Plato's Cave.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming out of the cave.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Getting used to that.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of us don't want
to stay in that cave.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we're used to being
localized in a physical,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and have relative sign
points to navigate, right?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum's job
is kind of like being

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in a boat, a little rowboat.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And all's you got is two oars.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And you're in that boat.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And we're used to the boat.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And our safety and security--
is that boat on the water?

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And the job of the quantum is
to eventually tear that boat

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:90%
apart.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you'll go
through some panic

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because its job is to
re-define who and what you are.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And so those quantum
acupuncture needles,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:10%
as you're digesting
those things,

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:10%
you're also getting ready for
the eggshell to start to crack.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:10%
So you're kind of like,
in that quantum boat.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And on the quantum boat,
eventually, consciousness

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is trying to wean you of
having the need to have

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:84%
a boat, and that
structured reality.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to move you to
the point of a continuum

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, consciousness
is always trying

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what it is.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a being state.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know what it is.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So it poses new
landscapes, let's say.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
A bubble-- let's use
a quantum bubble.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And inside that bubble,
it has the physics.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
In this reality, we
understand this physics.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's many different
orientations of consciousness

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:90%
to different forms of physics.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's always trying to
investigate who and what

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.100 align:middle line:90%
it is in new environments.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always
learning from the fractal

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that it sends into
the unknown, our life.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're sanctioned, then,
to almost like, moving along

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.860 align:middle line:90%
the lines of a Taurus.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:10%
You go out of the Taurus.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:84%
You have your
history of whatever

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:90%
lifetimes that may happen.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you've got
to report back to center

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.380 align:middle line:90%
all your experiences.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:10%
And so when the
collective has gone

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:10%
through, then that
reality, that realm,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:10%
it now begins to understand
what's happening inside

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:10%
of there because
consciousness is always

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.630 align:middle line:10%
investigating what
its potentials are,

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:10%
and what its capabilities are.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
investigating itself.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:44:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have the unconsciousness,
as a realm, that's securely

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:90%
tied, like the balloon.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you can imagine--
it's one of the simplest ways

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to understand it, is
if you take a balloon,

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and twist it in
opposite directions,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:84%
right at the midpoint,
the balloon--

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:84%
part of its brahmic, so
it remains consciousness.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Part of it goes unconscious,
and randomizes new potentials.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.170 align:middle line:10%
And as it experiences, it brings
all of that understanding,

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and new ways, new relations,
and new formulations,

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand
consciousness.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The way you use
quantum, it's--

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:84%
because I've noticed,
it has many definitions.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, it does.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And the way you're using it,
can you add to this definition

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of quantum from your definition,
so people don't get confused?

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> If we were to look at
consciousness as a fabric,

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:90%
what would that fabric be?

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, consciousness is close--

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
has quantum
characteristics to it.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to understand
just a few simple principles

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.400 align:middle line:90%
of quantum mechanics.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So one of those simple
quantum principles is fractal.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
seen those images

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of a mirror placed in
such a way that you

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:90%
see an infinite set of mirrors.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so consciousness, and
the fabric of consciousness,

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.270 align:middle line:90%
is like that.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It has infinite densities to it.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So it goes on forever
in either direction.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And holographic and simple
holographic metaphor,

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:52.970 align:middle line:10%
if you took a holographic film,
take a shot of the night sky.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And then you were
to cut that film up

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.100 align:middle line:10%
into millions of pieces
of varying sizes.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those pieces
of the holographic film,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:10%
if you looked into
it, magnified into it,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:10%
it would have everything that
the original picture had.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.190 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is lost.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness has fractal
and holographic qualities to it.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And then a simplified version of
entanglement and superposition.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yeah,
explain that for us.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Erwin Schrodinger, I believe
in the 30's, was observing

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:10%
the--

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.240 align:middle line:10%
>> The cat?

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.835 align:middle line:10%
>> Quantum-- yes,
exactly, my favorite.

00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:36.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:36.635 --> 00:46:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
everybody's favorite.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So he observed
quantum experiments,

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and found that no
two were the same.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.435 align:middle line:84%
And through a process
of elimination,

00:46:47.435 --> 00:46:54.390 align:middle line:84%
he found out that the
observer changes the outcome.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And so he came up
with a simple metaphor

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:04.190 align:middle line:84%
of Schrodinger's cat, where
he uses the model of a cat

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:90%
in a box.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And that his
superposition, the cat

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.060 align:middle line:84%
is facing in all directions,
until the observer

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.650 align:middle line:90%
comes and opens up the box.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, and--

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.875 align:middle line:90%
>> --has to entangle.

00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There's gas in
the box, right?

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.080 align:middle line:90%
To kill the cat.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:21.910 align:middle line:90%
That's getting real detailed.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right,
but that's the idea,

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.060 align:middle line:90%
is it's both alive and dead.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's both alive and dead,
and pointing in all positions.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so atomic, or quantum
systems, such as an atom,

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:42.170 align:middle line:84%
or photon, exists
in multiple states,

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and combinations
of multiple states.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a good example
of superposition, right?

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It's operating on solid,
liquid, gaseous plasma.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So until it's entangled,
then it has to linearize itself.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, until it's
separated as entanglement, or?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.542 align:middle line:84%
>> As it's separated
as entanglement.

00:48:03.542 --> 00:48:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>> As entanglement, right.

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is always entangled.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the
beautiful example,

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.930 align:middle line:84%
is if the observer
looks at the box,

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:16.830 align:middle line:84%
according to the entanglement
the observer has, then--

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The belief system
right affects the cat.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I need reality to be linear.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I need the cat to point in
this direction for my growth.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> My belief.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
makes it alive or dead.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right, and so if we
take that element, we can see,

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:40.520 align:middle line:84%
then, how powerful
belief systems are,

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
applying it to all of the--
when we went unconscious, we--

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.790 align:middle line:84%
the unicity split,
fractured, and dissociated.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand,
again, physics, we're

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at dark matter
and dark energy.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Dark matter is highly
contractive because

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of magnetics and
gravetics, right?

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Dark energy is repulsive.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's repelling.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we use that as an example
of unconsciousness, the moment

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:27.610 align:middle line:84%
we fractilized, when
we went unconscious,

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:90%
then everything was alien.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So everything
repulsed each other.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything is revulsive
to each other.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, here's--
the dynamics all start.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so two sharp stones,
eventually over the time

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.360 align:middle line:84%
stream, winds up at the
end, nice and smooth,

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and appreciating
each other, right?

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a metaphor for
our consciousness meeting

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.290 align:middle line:84%
all the challenges while
we're in the living body,

00:49:53.290 --> 00:50:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing 3D, and all of
the hardships, and the shadow.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
If we look at that
element there,

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.930 align:middle line:84%
the more we work
through the shadow,

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.500 align:middle line:84%
then it starts to
integrate all on its own.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at those elements,
like we said fractals,

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:84%
superpositions, the
observer effect,

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
just giving the audience some
tools to look at, of what

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to help define,
what is the quantum?

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So then they can then
take those metaphors

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
from these experiments, like
Schrodinger, and Niels Bohr,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and even Einstein
and others have done.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Then they can then
apply that quantum idea

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to what you're doing,
as quantum navigation.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, because I'm understanding
quantum navigation because I

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have an understanding
of those things.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.200 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of
quantum mechanics

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:84%
is helping me navigate
quantum navigation.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think you make it
very simple and easy.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
have those tools,

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:90%
you can still understand it.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But I recommend people
having that background

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.810 align:middle line:84%
because when I hear you talk,
and I hear you explain things,

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:84%
because you're always
referencing the fractals.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You're always referencing these
quantum fundamental basics.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That just help me get it.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.356 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's use a
little example--

00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:33.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --of applying just
what we talked about.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.540 align:middle line:84%
How does that entanglement
in the belief system

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:90%
affect the superposition of Ron?

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at
superposition as being--

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:52.330 align:middle line:84%
like earlier, we used this
symbol as the unicity.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:84%
You're everywhere
and everything.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And in your best
meditation, you feel

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:84%
so complete and so centered
and fulfilled, right?

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's closer
to superposition.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:90%
The entanglement--

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Being everywhere at the
same time, kind of thing.

00:52:11.677 --> 00:52:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, yes,
and everything.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
In everything, and
part of it all.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, OK, so let's
use an example now.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Contextually, as a
child, let's just say--

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and I used that example earlier
in when we were in the group.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Little Ronnie is learning
how to ride his two wheels.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:32.500 align:middle line:90%
So he's got training wheels.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But the day has come
where Ron's graduating.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's got to take
the training wheels off.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And the parents are there.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And Ron is going to go
show off what he's learned.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And he rides-- and the
parents already know,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Ronnie's going to fall.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And so Ronnie falls.

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, in the
trauma that Ronnie had,

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:90%
his whole world shattered.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.480 align:middle line:90%
He hurt himself.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't
maintain his balance.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And he feels embarrassed.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was showing
off really good.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, Ronnie goes to the parents
to look for support, nurturing,

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and reassurance, right?

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:90%
But that's the norm.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So, many of us have
experienced that our parents

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:27.010 align:middle line:84%
have had so many
stresses laid upon them.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Name them.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:90%
There's so many to have.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And let's say the parents
may be a little bossy--

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and I told you not to do
this, or not to do that.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So Ronnie is expecting
the support, nurturing,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:44.660 align:middle line:90%
and reassurance.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> But Ronnie gets?

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Scolded.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Scolded, so Ronnie goes
through this experience

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.760 align:middle line:90%
of, wait a minute.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I must have done
something wrong.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've offended
the parents.

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So Ronnie rewinds and replays.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And he builds a belief,
a story, and a belief,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and a feeling that goes with it,
all encapsulated within this.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Ronnie now has created his
first belief system that's

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:90%
complete with an emotion to it.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It's pain, shame, blame,
fear, guilt grief,

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and anger, all wrapped
up in, I'm guilty.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.062 align:middle line:90%
I'm unworthy, or whatever.

00:54:30.062 --> 00:54:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> For trying to ride a bike.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so let's say this
repeats in other areas similar.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So this belief
system is built up.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, let's say
Ronnie goes through, and finds

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.102 align:middle line:84%
his way to a real good
spiritual practice--

00:54:47.102 --> 00:54:49.560 align:middle line:84%
does a lot of meditation, and
eventually comes to the point

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.320 align:middle line:90%
where, hey, wait a minute.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Back at-- this wound I
have that I experienced

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:84%
at work is coming from-- it's
a repeat of the same thing,

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.740 align:middle line:90%
you know-- and, oh.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And so Ronnie learned--

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:10.320 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, Ronald at this time--
learned how to self-nurture--

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> The older version is Ronald.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --through the
unconditional love,

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and seen clearly through the
illusion of the belief system,

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and the emotion, and so on.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so Ron helps
navigate and restructure,

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.970 align:middle line:90%
re-pattern all that.

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But it comes from taking
the unconditional love

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of this centered place,
this being that knows who

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and what it is, really,
and goes back and goes,

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.250 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, no, no, no, no, here.

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to feel all
those old emotions.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You're valid for all of those.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.520 align:middle line:90%
But you need to see--

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.330 align:middle line:84%
you need to see
more of the picture.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you're the perfect
parent to go back in it.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when that
happens, when I said

00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:00.360 align:middle line:84%
there's splits, fractures,
and dissociations, inside

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.880 align:middle line:84%
of the unicity, it's
filled with paradox.

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And paradoxes are
equal opposites.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So like yin and yang, we
have three major opposites.

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:19.470 align:middle line:10%
One is the inner
child and the adult.

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:10%
That one is the first one to
really begin to come together.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:10%
At first, the inner child
wants more attention

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.470 align:middle line:10%
given to the freedom that a
child would normally have.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The adult has much more concerns
and wants all the attention.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But this dynamic will play
out inside of the individual,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:43.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll be these forces
because they haven't

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.240 align:middle line:90%
integrated together, right?

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And the child is magical.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And it remembers all the wounds.

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The adult, though,
needs the experience

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding to
eventually wake up to the fact

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, I have
all these wounds.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're located
in the inner child.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I better walk back this
because before then, they're

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:18.810 align:middle line:84%
working against each other,
like two horseshoe magnets that

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:84%
are turned in opposition
to each other.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:23.310 align:middle line:10%
They repel each
other because they

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:24.782 align:middle line:10%
don't understand each other.

00:57:24.782 --> 00:57:26.490 align:middle line:10%
They don't know they're
part of the same.

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.390 align:middle line:10%
>> They're yin and yang.

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:33.060 align:middle line:10%
So when the adult wakes up from
experience, from understanding,

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and from all of that spiritual,
really starts to see,

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:10%
oh, I am quantum.

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I need to go back and address
those wounds because they're

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.500 align:middle line:90%
entangling me in a timeline.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> So the adult then goes, hey--

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
because the adult has
been the wayward one.

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It hasn't been-- the child
has been the one to begin

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:04.950 align:middle line:84%
inside of a whole new
paradigm, that it has no parent

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that's really being attentive to
the needs of that little child

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:12.100 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, when it
faces all those challenges.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So it has to make up
stories, incomplete stories,

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and emotions that go with them.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:19.650 align:middle line:90%
They bind together.

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And they keep repeating.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So when the adult wakes up,
then they go, hey, child,

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I need to hear your stories.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.270 align:middle line:90%
I need to come closer, together.

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in being distracted

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:39.300 align:middle line:90%
from what your feelings are.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So the parent, you, the adult,
begins to repair the child.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The child remembers
all the wounds,

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:52.080 align:middle line:84%
but needs that unconditional
love and attentiveness

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of the adult to work through,
let's say, one major issue.

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.380 align:middle line:84%
The child will bring
up this major issue.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.350 align:middle line:90%
And so they'll come together.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And they'll begin to heal.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:07.320 align:middle line:84%
When the child does just
one, shows the parent,

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.310 align:middle line:90%
this is my wound.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And the parent goes,
oh my god, all right.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You're right and valid for
having all those feelings.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.120 align:middle line:90%
You went through that all alone.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm here.

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can share
this with them.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so as they work together,
then they begin to integrate.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And the split no longer exists.

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So they begin to really merge.

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you feel
superposition again.

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, I see.

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The inner child and the adult
feel the first of the bridge

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of the unicity, which
is consciousness, then,

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:84%
turning the horseshoe
magnets to attraction.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I need you.

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I need you, too.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.980 align:middle line:10%
And they work together.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.360 align:middle line:10%
And you start to
feel superposition.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Then you apply that
in the other two,

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.280 align:middle line:10%
which is the male and female.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And then-- higher
self, lower self.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of our darkness
is really important.

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There's where-- those are
where all the trophies are.

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones
that help us return back

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to superposition.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In a sense, as
we've talked before,

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:21.070 align:middle line:84%
with Sasha and Lyssa's work,
this is our ET families coming

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:25.420 align:middle line:84%
back to us, is these other
versions of us creating

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
superposition, as those
wounds are healed.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to make
contact, and feel that love,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and understand
that we're worthy,

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and work through
all those traumas.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:40.966 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
on, maybe like, a--

01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:44.020 align:middle line:84%
you're using the reference,
in our current lifetime.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.540 align:middle line:90%
But it goes beyond the lifetime.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the fractal
windows start opening up.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
And they start--

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Greater, bigger--

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that magnetization--

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Bigger lifetimes.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --takes place.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the magnets are
turned to attraction,

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.750 align:middle line:90%
it sends off a wave.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And it starts going,
oh OK, he's waking up.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.340 align:middle line:90%
You can come home now.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.798 align:middle line:84%
>> It's wake-up on
multiple levels.

01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're responsible for
stewarding all those timelines

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and all those races
back into the unicity

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
because there's only
unconditional love.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So I had this experience
when I was five years old.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
My father, who was a
disciplinarian, military guy,

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.660 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He used to really enforce
the discipline, you know?

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So my older brother and I,
we would take black and blue

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
punishment for whatever.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one time,
five years old,

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
in Japan, he took
all our clothes off.

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you don't
want to-- after he beat us.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you don't
want to live by my rules,

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:46.240 align:middle line:90%
you can go find your own place.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You can find your own
way to live, right?

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
So that was an entanglement.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a crib for me.

01:01:54.470 --> 01:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So I keep revisiting that until
I went back one, at one point.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And I could take back all the
stories and emotions that were

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
created at that time, you know?

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of like
the crown of thorns,

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and the wreath of
thorns around the heart.

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
You take them back.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
You die to that--

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.260 align:middle line:90%
you surrender completely.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
You take them, all
the stories back.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, there
was no longer a papa.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then my father, he just
turned into the quantum.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:34.180 align:middle line:84%
It was the open infinite
sky in the whole room,

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.530 align:middle line:90%
and my brother, and my mother.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
All of it changed.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of showed
me, that taught me

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
about how you work
with your shadow.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You work with your
entanglements.

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And you return to superposition,
just like that being came,

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and I said, I'm not ready yet.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it went off
into the quantum.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
