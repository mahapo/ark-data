>> Let's do some new stuff.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> First off, through the
show, I'm formulating a library

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:84%
of different ET races, and we've
touched on the Sassani a little

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But just to hear it
from you, maybe you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
could give us a little
bit about that archetype

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and who they are without
going full into the story.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
They are considered
a hybrid species

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
between what are
called the Grays

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and humans on Earth, in a
sense an artificial race,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're not
biologically real,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
but they live on a world called
Sassani in a parallel reality.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And because they are
genetically related to us,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
they have taken
up the invitation

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to open contact with us
through the dialogues

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:90%
in the channeling.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the first step
that they usually

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
take with a civilization
to initiate contact.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Bashar himself, which is the
name we use for the entity,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
is himself a first
contact specialist.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is that,
in delivering information

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to us through the channeling
and in other ways,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
he is allowing us
the opportunity

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to see if we want to absorb
and apply that information

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
in our lives which would make
a difference in our frequency,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
our energy, and make
us more compatible

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
with their
civilization, in order

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
for face-to-face, physical, open
contact to eventually occur.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So they see this as
simply communicating

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
with another aspect
of their own families,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
since they are related
to us genetically.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us to
decide what kind of a world

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:90%
we really prefer to have.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And if that goes in the
direction of welcoming

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
open contact then,
at some point,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to interact with
them, as I said, face-to-face.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's primarily
what he does,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and he's doing that
with many civilizations,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:90%
as well as our own.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And in a sense,
you are Bashar.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well he's explained
it in the linear fashion,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because from their perspective,
everything exists at once.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Time is an illusion, so
everything exists now really.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's separated by these
different frequency patterns

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we call, or perceive,
as the past and the future.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
linear perspective,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
yes, you could say, I am
one of his past selves,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.382 align:middle line:90%
and he is a future self of mine.

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, you
could say, we're

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the same soul in two
different time frames.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
For prepping for a
channeling session,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering what
kind of work goes into that.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
these announcements,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Darryl Bashar will be
at a certain location

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, certain topics.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.007 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, sometimes, we'll
usually get the dates first,

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:21.757 align:middle line:84%
and then later the
topic sort of comes in.

00:05:21.757 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.695 align:middle line:90%
How does the topic come in?

00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar will download
the basic topic title.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Whenever he's ready to do.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%
I never really know.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It'll just be there
suddenly, and I'll just

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
get, OK, these are the titles,
and here's the basic concept.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But I won't have
a clue what he's

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
going to say about any of
that, until he actually

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
channels it through.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So the preparation is
really nothing more

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
than, here's the subject
I'm going to talk about.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the basic concept.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
When people show up,
I'll talk about it,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and we just let that
happen in a natural way.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it always come
through just in time,

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:90%
or has there been any--

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.377 align:middle line:84%
>> There will be give and take
in terms of maybe a few weeks

00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:90%
here or a few weeks there.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We ideally like to get it far
enough in advance that we have

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
enough time to really
advertise what it is.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:11.547 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, we have to
trust his timing with it,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, it'll come
about three months before.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it'll come literally
like a few weeks before.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.127 align:middle line:84%
We never know exactly why
it comes when it comes,

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
but again, we just have
to trust that that's

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the right timing for the people
that are supposed to be there.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I've noticed

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that Bashar coming
through and you as Darryl

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
bringing this channeling
experience to the world

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is your amazing
vocabulary and the details

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to talk about
these high end concepts--

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.765 align:middle line:84%
time travel, linear
to parallel timelines

00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of things, and
more so than other channelers.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.308 align:middle line:84%
Not to put any other channelers
down, but I'm just wondering--

00:06:57.308 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's different for everyone.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> But looking back at my
life, I realize that there were

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
certain things that
happened that I, of course,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't know at the time and
didn't know until way after

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
the channeling started that were
setups for Bashar to be able

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to have access to the things
he would need in order for him

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate
what he needed to communicate.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the thing
I need to explain to people

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
first is Bashar, when
he comes through,

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:90%
is not speaking English.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
He's not speaking
any language at all.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a telepathic connection.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
When we vibrate in
a chord in harmony,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
you get a translation of his
thoughts out of my energy,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and it just simply
automatically accesses

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
as the words that
are in my vocabulary

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to explain the concepts that
he just sends in one flash,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and then it just slowly
on spools in our language.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But the entire answer
is there at once.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
The entire information
is there at once.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But looking back
at my life, there

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that happen
that obviously were preparation

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
for the ability to do this and
for the ability to give him

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the best vocabulary
he could access.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Because my parents
were telling me that,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
basically, when I was
a year and a half old,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:90%
I was reading books.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't looking at pictures.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I would sit on the couch
at a year and a half

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and read magazines and books.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up a
vocabulary very early on.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:90%
English has always been--

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- just
it's always just been--

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:90%
it felt natural to me.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
classes in school

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that I always excelled
in without even trying.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It was just like I just got
how things were supposed to go.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Punctuation, everything, it
just seemed like, of course,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
it's got to be that way.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:90%
There has to be a coma here.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the word you use.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:10%
And of course, that's also
led into partially a writing

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:10%
career, in film and books.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:10%
But I realized that it
also services his ability

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:10%
to be able to draw from the
vocabulary that's in my mind.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though I don't
have everything

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that I might be able to
have, because I haven't read

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
like deep math books
or things like that,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
but some physics for
terminologies and things.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
But at least it's
enough for him to be

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
able to draw from and explain
concepts in the best way

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that it is possible for him
to explain it in our language

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
without actually going
into mathematical equations

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people ask--

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
this is for some of the
channeler naysayers out there--

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
they're like, well, why don't
they just give us the formula

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
for free energy or give
us the formula for--

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he has.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's giving
it to us in pieces.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he understands that
the topics and the way that

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
they understand that science
is something we have to learn

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
in stages.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's like handing
a kid an atomic bomb.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
how this works,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have to do the simple
experiments that he suggests

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate the concept.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that, then he
usually gives people more.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So he is doing that, but he's
also doing it cautiously,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
because he knows that
we have a tendency

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to take information and
use it in negative ways.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Or just if we just don't
understand it clearly,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
then it could just be
detrimental in some way.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So he wants to make sure people
have a full understanding

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of each step that he gives
them before he gives them

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
more information, but he
is actually doing that.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I've seen in some
of the audiences,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm guessing privately
too, some scientists.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Even more so privately,
because in a public setting,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
it's not always appropriate
for all of those people

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to be sitting there listening
to something that is really

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
only for one or two people.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So he might give
a hint in public,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
but those people who
are interested usually

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
book a private session.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And we actually did one recently
with a group of scientists,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and they always seem very
happy with what they get,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and they come back often.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, we're at this
point in the technology now.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
We've created what you've said,
and we've got this effect.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do we do and he'll
usually guide them further,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
but that usually happens
in the private session.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you feel about that?

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.107 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel this--

00:11:21.107 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
you literally are assisting in
the technological development

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't even myself
always understand

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:90%
what it is they're asking him.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that I have
a full appreciation of what

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.013 align:middle line:84%
he's giving them, or what
they're attempting to do.

00:11:43.013 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's a lot of
fun, and I'm certainly

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by some of
the Bashar's technology.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
example I had,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:84%
in fact, of how the
channeling actually

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
works in terms of the
delivery of information

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and how it translates
into language.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Because early on, one of the
things I was fascinated about

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
was understanding how do
your ships travel from star

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:90%
to star so quickly?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the information, the
answer, was there in a flash.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It took me three
hours to write it out.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So it demonstrates not only
principles I've never heard

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of before, but it also
demonstrates the compact way

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
in which the information is
telepathically delivered.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And demonstrates how it
needs time to, like I said,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
sort of unspool in my brain
as a translation device

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:90%
into our language.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And you, having such a great
command of the language are

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
able to translate
it, in my opinion,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.342 align:middle line:90%
very clearly and understandably.

00:12:44.342 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, thank you.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And I think many others.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the thing I
really appreciate about the way

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Bashar delivers the
information, is he understands,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
because they themselves
are still somewhat physical

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:90%
in their reality.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:90%
He understands we're physical.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
He understands the information
has to be translated in a way

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that we use it as
physical people.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what I like is
that he takes all of these

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical concepts which
are fine in and of themselves,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
but I find that a lot of people
don't really understand how

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
does this metaphysical concept
apply in our physical reality?

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:90%
How do I use it to my advantage?

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he does.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
He acts as a go-between
between the concept

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be practically
and pragmatically applied

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
in physical reality
by giving us what

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is, for all intents
and purposes,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:90%
an instruction manual.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Do this A, B, C, D, E,
F, G, you get the effect.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
This is how these metaphysical
concepts translate

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
into your physical world
and how you get an effect

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:90%
by applying them in this way.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So he's literally
giving us a toolkit

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysical concepts
brought down to Earth in ways

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can just
go, OK, do this.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
There's the effect, and
that's what I really

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
appreciate about the way
he delivers information.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.809 align:middle line:90%

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that Bashar
has explained about things like

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
telepathy is our standard,
outdated definition,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
old world definition,
of telepathy is, oh,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading someone's mind.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bashar says, OK,
that's a description of what

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the effect feels
like, but that's

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
not a description of
what's mechanically

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
actually happening.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
You go to a certain brainwave
frequency, or energy frequency

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
in general, that
mirrors or matches

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
or harmonizes with the
other person's frequency.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you harmonize,
you're on the same wavelength

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
essentially, and you're
having the same thoughts

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, because
that's what that frequency

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
level represents.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're not actually reading
the other person's mind.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You're reading your
own mind that's

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
having the same thoughts
as the other person.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:10%
That's a mechanical description
of how telepathy works,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:10%
even though the experience
makes it appear as if you're

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.354 align:middle line:10%
reading someone else's mind.

00:15:33.078 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Since you brought it up--

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Are we on?

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Since you just brought
it up with the clicking,

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I've heard when--

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar comes
in, there's some--

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:90%
is that--

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The teeth.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that-- the
teeth, the clicking--

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
is that a Bashar energy,
or is that a Darryl thing?

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a translation
of energies that

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:90%
don't translate into words.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there are other
things happening that my body

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
is responding to, but it's not
the kind of energy that comes

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:90%
with information.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just a reaction
to the energy.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It might sometimes be
a reaction to something

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
he's doing on his end,
because he can multitask.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.657 align:middle line:90%
So he can be talking to us.

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
He can be doing something
in his spacecraft.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
He can be talking to someone
else at the same time.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So my body will
pick up on things,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:90%
but it's not information.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So it just comes
out as a sound or--

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> A click.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> A click or something.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And breath too
is a big part of--

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that
happened automatically

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
in the channeling.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:10%
So it's like he's saying--

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:10%
because of the
extra energy, he has

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that my body
is oxygenated to the point

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:10%
where it'll handle it, so
it doesn't burn me out.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:10%
So that automatic reaction
to that weird sort

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:10%
of deep yogic
breathing was something

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:10%
that my body just started doing
when the energy comes through.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I am
breathing less often,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:90%
but I'm taking in more oxygen.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's to
handle the energy.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> To handle the energy.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting, have you
done any formal training

00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
in breathwork or
anything like that?

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It just came
with the channeling.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
in past interviews

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and in "First Contact" your
visual experience of the UFOs.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Have you had any
physical or strange bumps

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
in the night from
actual Bashar coming

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in the room or
anything like that

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:90%
or being out in the desert?

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Not Bashar.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I had one experience
in I believe

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:84%
it was boulder Colorado,
where I had been channeling,

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was staying
in the guest room

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of this family that happened
to have these three sisters.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So middle of the
night, I'm in bed.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, from my experience,
what happened is I woke up,

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and the three sisters were
standing around my bed,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:90%
looking down at me.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what are you
doing here, and then I woke up.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It seemed very real.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They were really standing--
somebody was standing there,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
but then I actually woke up,
and there was nobody there.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But then the cows that
were on their ranch

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
were going bananas,
just like mooing.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So they woke us all
up, and we went out.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Something had happened.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Something was in the area that
the animals were picking up

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
on, and I had that weird thing
of these three people looking

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
down at me that looked like
the three sisters in the house

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:90%
but weren't.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But it was like I was
awake when I saw them,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think
I wasn't awake.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But then I woke up and saw
that they weren't there.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing that happened.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
happened is I have

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
a friend who is an abductee,
and she was staying over

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in our guest room
one night, and I

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
guess there was an
attempt again to take her.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the way
that begins for her,

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
as many abductees
have reported, is

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
with this sense of a paralysis
field, so she can't move.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I felt the edge of
that paralysis field.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It woke me up, but
I couldn't move.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And finally, because it wasn't,
I guess, fully focused on me,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I was able--

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
while I was trying for at least
60 seconds to move my hand--

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I finally managed
to move a finger.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.162 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I moved a
finger, the field broke,

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and I ran to her room,
and she sat up and goes,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:90%
did you feel that?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that?

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:90%
They were here.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, yes, I did.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
Bashar interactions,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I've only had, aside from
the physical sighting

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:90%
of his ship twice.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I've only had dream
encounters and conversations

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
with him that are, again,
unusual in that it's literally

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:90%
like I'm talking to you now.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing else
that happens in the dream.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We are talking, or he
shows me something,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
like the time which we
put in the movie, where

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know,
well, what happens

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
if I do meet you face-to-face?

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the dream,
I saw the ship land.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I saw him get out.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw him walk toward me, and
when he was about 20 feet away,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I lost my identity and saw
my body through his eyes.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And my body jerked back,
and he said, that's why.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You're not ready yet
vibrationally to be

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:90%

>> Overwhelming.

Like that.

00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:10%

>> Interesting.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:90%

I was like, it was
clipped to your belt.

change, or did you do it?

>> No.

I turned it-- I think
I turned it back on.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you just
turned it on and off.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
or what it would be like, to
actually meet him face-to-face,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and so in the dream encounter,
he showed me by landing a ship

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and walking toward me.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And when he was about 20
feet away, I lost my identity

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and saw my body
through his eyes,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and then my body backed away.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, see, that's what
happens, because our energy is

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
so overwhelming.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It would actually just
like overwhelm your energy,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and you'd lose your identity
in me, especially because we're

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:90%
connected in that way.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And that also was a
lesson in terms of why

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:90%
they don't physically land yet.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
There may be some
extraterrestrial beings that

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
are of a vibration
that we can handle,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
but they operate on a
very high frequency,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and so we're nowhere
near that level yet.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
saying, no matter

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
how much we may
want the contact,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
there are parts of us that
are compartmentalized,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and exposure to their
energy forces those things

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
to the surface within
us that we may not

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
be ready to integrate
within ourselves.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the fear we might feel is
actually the fear of things we

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:84%
ourselves contain, not
a fear of them directly.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But there is also an
aspect that activates

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that sort of survival, fight
or flight mechanism in our body

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
as well, because we
see them as alien

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and sense them as
something that's foreign.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we have that fear
reaction of something

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that might even feel predatory
to us, even though it's not.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So they're waiting until
the information can

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
be used to upgrade our energy,
so we become more vibrationally

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
compatible, and that's when open
contact will eventually occur.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I've had about four or
five dream encounters with him.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the ships
physically, but I haven't

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.298 align:middle line:90%
interacted with him physically.

00:23:05.298 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I actually-- just
something quickly to share--

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I had, when there was a session
here in LA a few months back,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and Bashar was interacting
with a gentleman.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.443 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of saying,
I'm ready for contact

00:23:18.443 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for contact.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I know what
you're talking about.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So during that moment,
Bashar is like talking,

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.157 align:middle line:84%
describing his mountain lions,
and he kept pushing and then

00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Bashar was trying to explain it.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And during that moment,
I was having physical--

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I started shaking.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I was having maybe,
potentially, I

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
guess I term it remembering of
potential contact experiences,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have any
like actual memories.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.065 align:middle line:84%
>> And just like getting
all nervous and sweating,

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:50.213 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like what is this crazy
feeling that I'm feeling here?

00:23:50.213 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a scream
in the audience, and it just--

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because he was
pushing that vibration through

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
my energy field, so people
could understand at least a bit

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
of what he was talking about.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And that particular girl,
who was also a channel,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
who was sensitive to that
energy, got a real blast of it,

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and she screamed, as if
she was facing a predator.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like I wanted
to scream inside.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good demonstration
of what someone might actually

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If they were to come in
contact with someone like

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Bashar at this
particular moment,

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and I understand the guy
was just stubbornly refusing

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.032 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was a great
demonstration, because I,

00:24:24.032 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
without him pushing--
because I'm the same way.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah,
bring on the ships.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I can take it. come on.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
We think so, and again, for
some ETs that might be fine.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they're different.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Frequency.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're relating
to us in a different way,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
but Bashar comes
from another reality.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
They operate 10 times faster
than we do in their reality.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big difference
and forcing our energy

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
their energy that way

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.577 align:middle line:84%
is like shoving two
gears together that are

00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:90%
going at different speeds.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You just strip the
teeth right off of it,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's not something
they want to do with us.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, not yet, let's hope.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Never.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's not do that.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Not until we
ramp up our gear.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
How long, when you go into
the channelling state,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.375 align:middle line:84%
is there a limitation
to the length of time

00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:90%
that you can hold it?

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there probably is.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though it is
an energizing thing,

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:84%
it is also in some ways
a disorienting thing.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Because time is very collapsed
for me in that state,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and if I stay in it longer
than a certain amount of time,

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like I
wasn't there that day.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a day, and I
feel a little bit ungrounded.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's a long time
to be sort of disconnected from

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
this perspective.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The longest I think I've
ever gone in one shot

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:90%
is about five hours.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.192 align:middle line:90%
That's still a long time.

00:25:44.192 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but normally
now, it'll be two hours.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It'll be three hours at the
most or something like that

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
which is usually,
again, not only

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
because of what's appropriate
for me and my body but also

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
what's appropriate
for people to absorb.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I find that, if
they get too much information,

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:84%
they just get overloaded, and
they forget everything that

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:90%
they've been told.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's about
delivering information

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:90%
in easily digestible amounts.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Let people process that.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Let people start to apply
it and make it their own,

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
ready for more stuff.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there's a balance
point, because Bashar realizes,

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I have to live my own life too.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And I have to be here.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.697 align:middle line:84%
>> You do, and not Bashar
living his own life.

00:26:24.697 --> 00:26:25.497 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:25.497 --> 00:26:26.665 align:middle line:90%
Well, he lives his own life.

00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
However he does that,
but yeah, me, Darryl,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I have to live my
own life in parallel,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
because I get to follow
my own passions aside

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.812 align:middle line:90%
from the channeling as well.

00:26:35.812 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some
of those passions?

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm a
filmmaker, a writer.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:10%
I love directing.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:10%
I love writing.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:10%
So this is I'm working
now on our third film out

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:10%
of our production company.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I've also now close to
finishing the second book

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
in a sci-fi series
that I'm writing.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So things like
that I love doing.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sci-fi book, the
first one, is what's it called?

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> "Shards of a Shattered
Mirror" "Cryptic" is book one.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm working on book two
now which is "Nocturnal."

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's revolving
around the character,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:90%
the hybrid character.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Willa.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Willa.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:10%
Willa is another being
that I've channeled,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:10%
but I've taken some
of the stories she's

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:10%
told about her actual life.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
She's a hybrid 700 years
in the future on Earth.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I've taken some of
that information

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and incorporated it into
a science fiction story,

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's not so much about
telling her literal story.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It's about really
giving people something

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that they can be excited
about and can really

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
stretch imagination, even though
her life itself literally is

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:90%
somewhat unusual and exciting.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what
the book is doing

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
is taking us through what they
call the five levels of mastery

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
which allows them to become
more and more and more connected

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to all aspects of reality,
including other dimensions

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
In essence, it's like
going from someone

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
who is very deeply
ingrained in nature

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and taking that with them
through becoming someone who's

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
connecting to
parallel realities,

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
becoming a shapeshifter,
becoming a sage,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
becoming beyond that,
where they're actually

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
starting to manipulate space and
time and all sorts of things.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And these are things she's
actually going through

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.240 align:middle line:84%
in her life, but I'm weaving a
story around that, in a sense,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:90%
to make it more exciting.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So but she's also sort of
another version of you.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> She's another-- yes,
another like future self.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So these different
levels of mastery,

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.447 align:middle line:84%
were they actually channeled
through her and then the story

00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:45.405 align:middle line:90%
was filled in with you?

00:28:45.405 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
exists in her time.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> In her time.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.533 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I was just wondering
how much of the book was--

00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's
probably blending.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I would say really only
about 10% of the book

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:90%
is literally her reality.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The rest of it is a made up
science fiction story around

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I am wondering how many
people in the Bashar world

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
or people following this
stuff actually are taking it

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:90%
as a story and not taking--

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've announced that
it's not fully real and given

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
them the same kind
of percentage,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
but hopefully they
enjoy it anyway.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is fun.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just took my first
trip to Ireland actually,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:90%
a couple weeks ago.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.397 align:middle line:90%
And that's some of the--

00:29:29.397 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
well, at least when
she comes through,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.517 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of Ireland energy.

00:29:32.517 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's where she lives.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.860 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's why.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But even in early
years and still now,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, we hear Bashar
with this Irish accent.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.185 align:middle line:84%
>> The accent is an unusual
thing that happens in a lot

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:47.985 align:middle line:90%
of channelings.

with you today

about the first
level of mastery.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I can explain
it as is, well, two things.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the way the
energy comes through

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in bringing the
concept, it stresses

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:84%
things in a certain
way energetically that

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:84%
translate in my brain
in a way that comes out

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
sounding like an accent.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing is that,
because they are as entities

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to my mind, at least some
part of my mind, foreign--

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> My brain also has to add some
inflection to it that comes out

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
as an accent to make it make
sense out of how they feel

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
to in order to let them
come through fully.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So I just noticed
that that's just

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:84%
what naturally happens
in order to not block it

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:84%
from coming through in the way
that it needs to come through.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it
just seems like it

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
has to come through with
that emphasis or that accent

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:84%
in order for it to
be representative

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of what they're
saying in real time

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
or what they're
thinking in real time.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an unusual phenomenon,
but again, as with Willa,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.526 align:middle line:90%
it literally is her accent.

00:31:52.526 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, synchronistically
half of my background is

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Arabic.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Bashar is an Arabic word.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't speak Arabic, but that
was the word that was there,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was only told much
later that the word simply

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
means messenger, which is
exactly what he's doing.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's appropriate.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But the other
side of me is Irish.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:90%
My mother was Irish.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, there's these weird
synchronicities of the name we

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
use for him being an Arabic
word and a connection to another

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:84%
future self that is
actually in Ireland.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So it just all seems
to work together.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:10%
So in the "First
Contact" film, you

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:39.267 align:middle line:10%
did an EEG scan of your brain.

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>> While I was channeling.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>> While you were channelling.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were
different states of--

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Brain wave.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Delta brain waves.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe a little
bit about what those different

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:90%
states are?

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
We were really excited
about doing that,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's really not
so much about trying

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
to prove that Bashar is real,
because I can't do that.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What we did demonstrate
scientifically,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I think probably for the first
time that I'm aware of, is that

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the channeling state is
a true altered state.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the EEG readouts
were definitely

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating that a
lot of unusual things

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.097 align:middle line:84%
are going on in the
brain when people

00:33:17.097 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:90%
are in a channeling state.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And channeling is a
natural thing all of us do.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever anyone is truly
following their passion,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
they're not experiencing
the passage of time,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:84%
you're probably in a
channeling state which is,

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
as we discovered
in the EEG test,

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
between 40 and 100 cycles per
second in the brain which is

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:90%
a state called gamma.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, some
unusual things are happening.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
unusual we found was--

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
this takes a little
bit of explanation--

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
when people are growing
up, and their brain starts

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
absorbing information, it goes
to a certain frequency point,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and it generally stops.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
set point in the brain,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and what that
means is your brain

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like taking snapshots
of reality at a certain rate.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:84%
Now, mine in general
was nine Hertz,

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:19.800 align:middle line:84%
nine frames per second, which
is a typical amount of rate

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:90%
of absorption.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
That set point is
according to our science,

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and everything we know about
brain science up to this point

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
is not supposed to change over
the course of your lifetime.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, if
it ever did change,

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
it would have to take place
over a long period of time

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:84%
or be instigated by some
sort of brain trauma

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:84%
or some major thing that
would happen to the brain

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:90%
to change that set point.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.721 align:middle line:84%
>> But what we discovered
is that when I go

00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
into the channeling state it
changes in seconds and goes

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.320 align:middle line:84%
from 9 to 10 to 11 to wherever
it needs to go to represent

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is he's either doing
in terms of sending information

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
through or listening to the
information someone else is

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:90%
asking him about.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And it actually goes
higher when he's listening

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:90%
than it does when he's talking.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so one of the things the
technician took from that was

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that there is a higher
focus, a higher concentration

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of attention, given to when
he is actually listening

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:90%
to someone talk.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Because he's assessing
all of the things

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
in that statement

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
emotional level,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the real intention
behind asking the question,

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and many other aspects.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:90%
So there was that.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:84%
One other unusual
thing was there

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
is a portion of
everyone's brain that

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for
processing your personality,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
so that you can express
yourself as the person you are.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:84%
During the channeling state,
that portion of the brain

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:90%
shuts off completely.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:90%
So who's talking?

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:90%
So your personality is gone.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.125 align:middle line:84%
>> My personality is
gone during that state,

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and there are many other
things that are happening,

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.547 align:middle line:84%
including a very heightened
sense of connectivity.

00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
See, a lot of people think
it's actually a trance state.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a trance state.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of
heightened connection,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
so that more associations
are being made,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:84%
more connections are
being made faster.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a higher rate
of processing information,

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:84%
organizing information,
and delivering information

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.573 align:middle line:84%
from a very, very precise,
high level frequency.

00:36:31.573 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So many different things
we were able to demonstrate

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.088 align:middle line:84%
are happening in the channeling
state that are highly unusual.

00:36:37.088 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it something you're
going to continue to research

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more?

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:90%
We will.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll look for other ways
to get that data as well.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Looking forward to
validating this.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, as a state of being
is what we're trying to show

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and again that everyone
has the ability to do this.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if they can
simply allow themselves

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to get into that
state, it brings

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
on a lot more creativity, a
different perspective of things

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.740 align:middle line:84%
from a higher level, and it's
very conducive to problem

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
solving in a lot
of different ways.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you heard of the
book "Stealing Fire" by--

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard the
name of the book.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what it's about.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They actually do a
really good job of going

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:84%
into different altered
states with plant medicines

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
or indigenous culture,
trance, even channeling,

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and they call it flow states.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.695 align:middle line:84%
So find your flow state right
how Navy SEALs and Silicon

00:37:27.695 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Valley and all these
people are really trying

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:90%
to get into these flows states.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> For increased production or--

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, access to
inspirations, new ideas,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:40.270 align:middle line:90%
new perspectives.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And even in sports.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> absolutely.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Greater athletic ability.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
as being in the zone.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>> In the zone.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So to speak.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the same state.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So you were just saying
that Bashar has this--

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
more information,
it seems, is going

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:84%
through in the listening state,
or the waves I should say.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> More attention.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> More attention.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Is being focused on
listening than speaking.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There's often-- and I've
always wondered this in a lot

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of the sessions--

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
certain people ask
certain questions.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, there is
a lot of repetitivity.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Repetitiveness.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Repetitiveness in
the questions as well,

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:90%
because there's new people--

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:24.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:24.318 --> 00:38:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Sure, of course.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --who are just getting
on to the information.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.803 align:middle line:84%
>> To Bashar, it's
never a repeat.

00:38:28.803 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's what I mean.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:35.037 align:middle line:84%
I've seen cases where
Bashar is quick to like

00:38:35.037 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:84%
boop-boop-boop, follow the
formula, and get out of here.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I've seen
some cases where

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Bashar has been very patient.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:84%
His basic criteria
is, if he senses

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.350 align:middle line:84%
you're needing a
lot of explanation,

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:84%
you're really not familiar,
he'll take his time.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:84%
If he senses you're about
this close to getting

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:84%
it and crossing that threshold,
he'll just say, look,

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:90%
this is all you need.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Bum-bum-bum, done.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So just do it that way, and
there's no reason for you

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to take more time, unless
you really want to,

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.088 align:middle line:90%
but you don't have to.

00:39:07.088 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You're close enough
that you can just

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:84%
get pushed right
over that threshold,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:90%
if that's your choice.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So he will indicate that by
the amount, or lack thereof,

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of information he may
deliver to someone.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:23.803 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there are sometimes
also other reasons for the way

00:39:23.803 --> 00:39:25.220 align:middle line:84%
he delivers
information to people.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, sometimes, he can
only give a person so much,

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
because more would
interfere with their process

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.090 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, he might
be able to give them

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.580 align:middle line:84%
more later, when
they have arrived

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:84%
at another point
in their process.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, sometimes, the information
he would give to a person

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
privately is not appropriate
to give to them publicly.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's sensing all of that,
and he also does this thing

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that he's explained.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:84%
This is part of what the
first contact specialists do.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they know there's a
probability that they could

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
inappropriately intervene
in a person's process,

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.750 align:middle line:84%
which they will never
do, they actually

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.810 align:middle line:84%
impose blockages
on themselves when

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.670 align:middle line:90%
they come through a channel.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So that if there is
information they're

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.430 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to tell them
that would harm their process,

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.680 align:middle line:84%
then they simply won't
know or have access

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:90%
to that information.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:84%
When they detach, they
might know it all.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But when they come
through the process,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.190 align:middle line:84%
they have this imposed
framework, or blockage,

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:84%
on the knowledge they have
access to, to ensure that they

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
do not interrupt a
person's process.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:84%
That's important for
them to go through.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.098 align:middle line:84%
Because there's many
times when there's

00:40:35.098 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
a mouthful of information
just spilling out

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:90%
of all this detail.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's the
times where like--

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Just can't say
that right now.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So just really--

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not
appropriate right now.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wondering, yeah.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you don't
need it right now.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.527 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a lot of sarcasm
in there too in some cases.

00:40:47.527 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of humor.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of humor.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.668 align:middle line:84%
Humor, sarcasm,
some people may who

00:40:51.668 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:84%
are like looking for the
answers, and then they--

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels a little--

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting,
because what we've seen Bashar

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
do a lot of times is, yes, you
can see a person might be like

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:84%
chomping at the bit
to get certain thing.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And he'll take them on
this weird little journey.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:06.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Where it seems like he's
not answering the question,

00:41:06.582 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:84%
but what he's doing is he's
leading them with his questions

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and their answers around.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Until suddenly, it comes
back to the main question,

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they realize,
oh, now I understand,

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and they've got the answer.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, he wants to
take them through a process

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to show them they
have the ability

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to get the answer without
necessarily coming to him

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
or anyone else to get it.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of his job too
is to make sure we understand,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:84%
we're self-empowered,
and it's not

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
about running to
him or anyone else

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to give our power away, like
we don't have the ability

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:90%
to do that, because we do.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have access to
all the information we need,

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's primarily what he's
attempting to get across to us

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is he's in this job to
put himself out of a job.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> He wants us to know we
all have the ability to get

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever we need in life.

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:90%
That's his main message.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of my favorite
messages of the teachings.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>> With that said,
there's many Bashar--

00:42:05.665 --> 00:42:07.165 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
to call them this.

00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They might get offended--
but these Bashar groupies,

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:90%
in the sense.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.097 align:middle line:84%
>> People who are
familiar with information.

00:42:14.097 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> They are groupies even.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No, please.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So does it ever get
burdening, or is there ever--

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:90%
It's very sweet.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I appreciate it, and
I'm very grateful that they get

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot out of the information.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very rewarding for
me to know that they do,

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:90%
but I have my own life.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.860 align:middle line:90%
They have their own lives.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't need them to follow me.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to lead anybody.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I just need to live my own life.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.080 align:middle line:90%
This is just something I do.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful that
it helps a lot of people.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It helps me too, but again, the
message is use the information.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's fine.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean I
can't make friends.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's really not a focus
of mine, because I know--

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and again, it comes from
Bashar's perspective,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:90%
the idea of needing followers--

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Just weighs me down in my
life from being able to do what

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I need to do as myself.

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So I like everything to stay
very light and streamlined

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
with people in my
interactions with them.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So that they know I'm not
looking for them to follow me.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of the
reasons I have so much respect

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:84%
for you and the Bashar
material is that you definitely

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.600 align:middle line:90%
don't put off that vibe.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, come follow
me or anything like that.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There is very
much self empowering,

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
but even still with you
trying to get that message.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I still do see--

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I use the phrase
groupies-- but people

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.630 align:middle line:84%
who tend to latch to
wanting that information.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but I have ways
of communicating that create

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:90%
a proper separation.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hats off.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:11.458 align:middle line:84%
It's very good, and especially
in Japan, Bashar is quite--

00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> He's quite popular
in Japan, yeah.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> He's quite popular in the
teachings they're doing out

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.935 align:middle line:84%
there, and myself, I was
in Japan for five years.

00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:21.735 align:middle line:90%
My wife's Japanese.

00:44:21.735 --> 00:44:22.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a connection there.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen some of
the Japanese culture

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.120 align:middle line:84%
tend to have this
groupie mentality.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Even more than
other cultures.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Right, but they also have the
idea of respectful distance.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So it does sort of
balance itself out a bit,

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and so for a time that's
allotted in the session I

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:84%
don't mind the fun of
interacting with them

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.290 align:middle line:90%
and seeing them all excited.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.693 align:middle line:84%
But then they themselves kind
of impose, OK, time to go.

00:44:52.693 --> 00:44:53.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:53.493 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Leave him alone.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Let him go off and do his thing.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Very shy culture too.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good balance,
and I love the culture.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I really relate
strongly to the culture.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I always have.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've been to
Japan several times.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been there 18 times.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 times, wow.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:09.805 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think, when I reached
out to you for this interview,

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
you had just taken a
quick trip there as well.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.940 align:middle line:90%
That was for other reasons.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.177 align:middle line:84%
>> That was for
the film business.

00:45:20.177 --> 00:45:20.977 align:middle line:90%
>> I got you.

00:45:20.977 --> 00:45:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there were potential
investors that we were talking

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.920 align:middle line:84%
to over there, but yes,
most of the trips have been

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of actually
channeling over there.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
for the popularity

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is not just because of
the channeling sessions,

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:38.740 align:middle line:84%
but the people that
sponsored me over there,

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.170 align:middle line:84%
we would do several
sessions over the course

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:42.208 align:middle line:90%
of a week or two.

00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:84%
They would take all
that information,

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and they would
publish it as a book.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So then more people got a
chance to start reading about

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:84%
who Bashar was and what
his information was about,

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what really
started it exploding in Japan.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.950 align:middle line:90%
I think it was--

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- well
over 10 years ago

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that the publisher that was
bringing me over there, I think

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they estimated at that
time probably like 2% to 3%

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of the entire country
knew who I was.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.208 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's millions
and millions and millions

00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not unusual,
especially there,

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:90%
for people to just recognize me.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's one of the
talking points of how I met

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:26.880 align:middle line:90%
my wife.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.110 align:middle line:84%
We met randomly
through another friend,

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and we were just having lunch.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
Bashar, and she goes,

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.468 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm reading Bashar's book
right now, and I'm like what?

00:46:36.468 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I know the
synchronicity is bizarre,

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually kind of cool,
because I run into several

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.060 align:middle line:84%
people, especially within
the last few years,

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.255 align:middle line:84%
that have met because of
Bashar's information and formed

00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:49.380 align:middle line:90%
relationships and all that.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.755 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
another cool aspect

00:46:50.755 --> 00:46:53.690 align:middle line:84%
is that it brings people
together and lets them find

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:84%
each other through the
synchronicity of being there,

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and that's how I met my wife.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.240 align:middle line:84%
She came to the
channeling classes

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that I was taking when I was
first learning to be a channel.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So he's responsible for a lot
of people getting together.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar and Darryl
the matchmaker.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Bashar the matchmaker.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are
forever grateful.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knew Bashar was a yenta?

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:23.060 align:middle line:10%
>> So also in Japan, so
Ayako Sekino is someone who

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:10%
I've interviewed on the
show here last season,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:10%
and you've done events with her.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, a couple.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:10%
>> She told me during that
interview that when she first--

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.350 align:middle line:10%
this was like maybe
in the early '90s--

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:10%
that she was in the audience.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And she literally passed out,
and they had to drag her out.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember hearing about it.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it, because
I was channeling.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:50.203 align:middle line:84%
>> So back then, so she actually
claimed to channel Bashar

00:47:50.203 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of years.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> She did for a while.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a couple of people
who Bashar spoke to who were

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.650 align:middle line:84%
interested in
learning to channel,

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and he agreed for a limited
period of time to allow them

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:84%
to channel him, so they would
get used to the idea what that

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.150 align:middle line:90%
felt like.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned
it over to whatever

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
other entities
they were actually

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:84%
supposed to make agreements with
to come through them or just

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.910 align:middle line:84%
let them be their own
conscious channels.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So for a while, there were
a few people that did it.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.420 align:middle line:84%
At this point, that
doesn't happen anymore.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only one that he
comes through at this point.

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And I heard I think around
I've listened to some really

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:84%
old Bashar channelings, and
I've heard that there was even

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.870 align:middle line:90%
a dolphin named Dreamer.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, has come
through now and then.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.575 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you have any
idea how that works?

00:48:37.575 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same mechanism.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it like
through sonar, or--

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's the same telepathic
vibrational mechanism.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And then a dolphin--

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.553 align:middle line:84%
>> But I can always tell that
there's always a different

00:48:45.553 --> 00:48:48.710 align:middle line:84%
flavor to a different
kind of entity.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So I understood it was
something other than Bashar,

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and there have been a
few other entities that,

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.022 align:middle line:84%
over the course of 36 years,
have come in to say something,

00:48:58.022 --> 00:48:59.480 align:middle line:84%
because it was
important for Bashar

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.515 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate someone
else to say something

00:49:03.515 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:90%
from another point of view.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.057 align:middle line:84%
But I can always
tell that there's

00:49:06.057 --> 00:49:09.200 align:middle line:84%
a different energy to the
entity's consciousness,

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.260 align:middle line:84%
but the mechanism
is always the same.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It's that resonance
frequency matching

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to be able
to translate whatever

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.640 align:middle line:84%
another sentient consciousness
is able to communicate,

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and dolphins are sentient.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.408 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was actually
channeling through the dolphin

00:49:24.408 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to the dolphin community.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, he might be.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> He might be.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You haven't heard anything.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know all of that.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I do know they're
telepathically connected

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of other
consciousnesses

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that are extraterrestrial
and extra-dimensional.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that he's
ever specifically said,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.513 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm channeling to
a bunch of dolphins.

00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:44.180 align:middle line:84%
You would have to ask
him that question.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The answer is probably,
yes, I would guess.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, sure, but yes, they
can channel to dolphins as well,

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:84%
because again, they're a
similar sentience to us.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So going back to channeling
these other entities.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.377 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the channeling
state, channeling Bashar,

00:50:01.377 --> 00:50:03.710 align:middle line:84%
are you able to recognize
when these other entities come

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.490 align:middle line:90%
through, like Willa.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I was saying.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I can always tell the
difference, because they

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.180 align:middle line:84%
have completely
different energy,

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:84%
completely different flavor
to them, or a sense to them.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:17.505 align:middle line:84%
And on very rare
occasions, almost always

00:50:17.505 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:84%
during a private
session, I think

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:84%
there have been a couple of
exceptions, now and then,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.120 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, it'll seem
like it's important to suddenly

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:84%
become mediumistic and actually
bring through someone who's

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.980 align:middle line:90%
dead to talk to the person.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's really rare for
me, because I'm not really

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that kind of a
channel or a medium.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But it has happened
on rare occasions

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that I guess Bashar feels
it's important for you

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to give them a sign that
this person still exists.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.167 align:middle line:84%
>> This actually just
happened recently.

00:50:47.167 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But not with a dead person,
with a spirit of someone who

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.700 align:middle line:84%
was potentially about to become
someone's baby to be born

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.500 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So like on the other end.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> The other end.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And so Bashar suddenly
picked up on a name.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And said does this
name mean anything to you,

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.540 align:middle line:84%
or something like it, and it
was exactly what the couple was

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
pretending that a
pumpkin was their baby,

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and they had called it this
name that he picked up on from

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.390 align:middle line:84%
the spirit saying,
yeah, that's me.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of things are
rare, but when they happen,

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.940 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting
and astonishing.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Because a person that is what
we consider a person in spirit

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:84%
has a very different
feeling from Bashar.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They feel a little
bit more lighter.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They feel a little bit more
familiar, like we feel,

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.960 align:middle line:90%
people feel.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And because that
happens now and then,

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:90%
it increases the sense of--

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I know this is not
exactly the best word--

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but it increases the
sense of alien-ness

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that Bashar brings with
him, because he really

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial
being from another reality.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so by getting that
comparison of something that is

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:84%
a spirit from our realm
and an extra-dimensional

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial
from another realm,

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:84%
you really can start to
really feel a vast difference

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in the sensing of
their consciousness.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They all have a
different feeling.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I think one time, I remember
during a channeling session,

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Anubis came through, and
the voice was very deep.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.128 align:middle line:84%
Then, you're dealing
with something

00:52:26.128 --> 00:52:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that's like an archetypal level
of our collective consciousness

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.150 align:middle line:90%
which is a big energy.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, it'll express
itself in a very different way.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, however it is my brain
in this culture translates

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that kind of an energy will
be the way that it processes

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.240 align:middle line:84%
through me and comes
out to represent

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.820 align:middle line:84%
what I'm feeling that
energy is, but it just

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.460 align:middle line:90%
happens automatically.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.627 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's always usually
Bashar facilitating those

00:52:50.627 --> 00:52:51.427 align:middle line:90%
connections.

00:52:51.427 --> 00:52:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> He facilitates it.

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm familiar with
him now after 36 years,

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.460 align:middle line:84%
so it's easier for something
else to come through,

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.250 align:middle line:90%
if he provides the pathway.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Because he's the link to my end,
and he's the link to their end.

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I recognize what
he's doing on my end,

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and that way, whatever
new is coming through

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:15.350 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel so unusual anymore.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like smoothing it out.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and during this
30 plus years of channeling,

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.100 align:middle line:84%
obviously, you just said,
you've been incorporating

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.190 align:middle line:84%
the teachings and making
them a part of your life,

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.235 align:middle line:84%
as I think everyone--
well, not everyone,

00:53:30.235 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:84%
but everyone who listens
to Bashar-- it works, guys,

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.040 align:middle line:90%
trust me.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing it too--

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.710 align:middle line:84%
but how about like your
intuitiveness and your--

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --that too?

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I get these like psychic
hits all the time

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:84%
about something that's
supposed to-- especially

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:90%
while I'm driving.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:50.125 align:middle line:84%
I'll know exactly when someone's
going around that corner

00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:52.795 align:middle line:84%
or step off or what
the car is going to do,

00:53:52.795 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
signaling or not.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just, it just opens
up a whole new sense

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of being connected
to other things.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can start to
read those energies.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't always
listen, because I'm not

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.820 align:middle line:84%
used to exactly recognizing
all of them yet,

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're
usually very subtle.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But I usually find that, if
I have a passing thought that

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:84%
feels a certain way, that
something's going to happen

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.788 align:middle line:84%
or I should take this
with me or do something,

00:54:17.788 --> 00:54:20.330 align:middle line:84%
it usually always comes out to
be that I should have done it.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.998 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm starting to recognize,
OK, that's the difference.

00:54:22.998 --> 00:54:23.885 align:middle line:90%
That's one of those.

00:54:23.885 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not just my own
thought about something.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those moments, where
I'm reaching out with my senses

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and able to tell like there's
a leading edge of a wave coming

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that I'm reading that means
this is about to manifest

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.160 align:middle line:84%
in physical reality,
because everything happens

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.290 align:middle line:90%
in energy first.

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So it definitely has
increased my sensitivity

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.380 align:middle line:84%
to those kinds of
things, and of course,

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.770 align:middle line:84%
it just increased my own
capacity for creativity

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.897 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration.

00:54:52.897 --> 00:54:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting into that flow state.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, in the zone.

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> In the zone, perfect.

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.337 align:middle line:84%
During this 30 plus
years of doing this work,

00:55:00.337 --> 00:55:02.420 align:middle line:84%
have you ever thought about
throwing in the towel,

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:90%
quitting?

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.098 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not really.

00:55:05.098 --> 00:55:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I know that my life goes through
different cycles, where I've

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.670 align:middle line:84%
channeled more or channeled
less for different reasons,

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and I know that there is,
for lack of a better term,

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:17.780 align:middle line:84%
an expiration date to
this at some point.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't exactly
know when that is.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
channeling will evolve,

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and especially if I start
talking more as myself,

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.910 align:middle line:84%
there might be less need
for it in its present form.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if they do in
fact in the near future come

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.430 align:middle line:84%
here physically and
have open contact,

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
there would be no point, because
you can just talk to him.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So why would I need
to channel him?

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.372 align:middle line:84%
>> That's going to be season
five of "Interview with ED."

00:55:40.372 --> 00:55:41.172 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll see.

00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when,
but yeah, so there

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.070 align:middle line:84%
are reasons why it
wouldn't continue this way,

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:48.720 align:middle line:84%
but they'll happen in
their own natural timing.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.135 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they've done this,

00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and they know what
they're doing.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that is the
timing for them also factors

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.320 align:middle line:84%
into the timing for
us, because they know

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:90%
how long it's supposed to take.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're just
going with the flow.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And just if it wants to
keep coming through you,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.780 align:middle line:84%
you're being that
open conduit channel?

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Have you been following
the recent developments

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:84%
in the disclosure movement,
as far as the ATIP program--

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, some.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --and "The New
York Times" and such?

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I have followed some of it.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything to say
on that and take?

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it will happen
at some point in some way,

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think it is
beginning to happen.

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.680 align:middle line:84%
There has been more
information that

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.052 align:middle line:84%
has been being released,
bits and pieces.

00:56:37.052 --> 00:56:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> The videos and the--

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Videos that are being
verified by the Navy and other

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.080 align:middle line:84%
people that are theoretically
usually taken seriously.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know there are people
on the inside of it that are

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:50.580 align:middle line:90%
trying to get it outside.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:52.023 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, I'm not
really worried about it,

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.210 align:middle line:84%
because I know that it'll
happen in its own good timing.

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:59.472 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
more people absorb

00:56:59.472 --> 00:57:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the kind of information that
Bashar and others brings

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.570 align:middle line:90%
through will help accelerate it.

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So again, I just trust
the timing of it.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you get a little sense
of validation over the years?

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A little.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bashar material
coming through,

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.053 align:middle line:84%
and then now we're actually
seeing in the news every week.

00:57:16.053 --> 00:57:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a little bit.

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to get
the confirmation,

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:84%
especially if he's talked
about certain kinds of physics

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.460 align:middle line:84%
principles and stuff
like that years ago,

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and I see an article or
something about physicists now

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:30.940 align:middle line:90%
saying exactly the same thing.

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So that helps keep me
in a sense of knowing that

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:39.400 align:middle line:84%
it's on track, and so that's
nice to get that confirmation

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.200 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.745 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any--

00:57:44.745 --> 00:57:46.620 align:middle line:84%
well, I know you probably
follow the formula,

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.330 align:middle line:90%
so you don't have expectations.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Not insistence.

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Insistences on the
outcome of contact happening

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:55.130 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetimes?

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe so.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe so, because the
energy I get from him is that,

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from their perspective,
it's relatively imminent.

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:04.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what imminent means to
him and what it means to us,

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.540 align:middle line:84%
we can be a little
impatient about it.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it should
happen next year.

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I think
within our lifetimes

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:14.250 align:middle line:84%
is a reasonable assumption
that it will appear.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Perfect, and
finally, I don't know,

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.270 align:middle line:84%
we've already answered this,
but if you have any other words

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.010 align:middle line:90%
to say, who is Darryl Anka?

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> He's just a guy who
does this thing really.

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Channeling
inter-dimensional beings.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm an artist.

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just someone
who is exploring

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:47.260 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of myself
and consciousness and reality.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated by these things,
and this is just what happened.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It's that old sort of
chestnut of the basic form

00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of a story in a film,
an ordinary person who

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.250 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary
thing happened to.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I've just gone
with it, because I

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.880 align:middle line:84%
understand that that's
just my life unfolding,

and that's who I am.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we're glad you're here.

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We're glad you're grounding
this information in.

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You seem very grounded,
like an everyday guy

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:25.130 align:middle line:84%
that I can go have a
hamburger with or vegan

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.180 align:middle line:84%
burger, Impossible Burger
or something, right?

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, or a beer.

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a beer, I was going
to say a beer, and yeah,

00:59:31.177 --> 00:59:33.385 align:middle line:84%
appreciate everything you're
doing in this community.

00:59:33.385 --> 00:59:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, and you as well.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate the opportunity
to talk about this

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.710 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of venues.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much,
look forward to more.

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Hugs?

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.590 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:51.776 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is one thing.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.140 align:middle line:84%
You, us, everything
within existence

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
are reflections of one
intelligence, one existence,

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.450 align:middle line:90%
one self-awareness.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The idea, therefore,
is that once

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
you have this sense
of self, by creating

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
a sense of an other-than
self, you instantly

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
develop and expand into the idea
of the structure of existence,

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:38.690 align:middle line:90%
the nature of existence.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can
perpetuate everything

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
you experience from
that point forward

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.390 align:middle line:90%
as reflections of all that is.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
This leads to the
idea of the five,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
what we have called the five
laws, which are as follows.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.188 align:middle line:90%
You exist.

01:00:57.188 --> 01:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
can do to change that.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.670 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything is here and now.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
can do to change that.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080 align:middle line:90%
The one is all.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.590 align:middle line:84%
The all are one,
as we have said.

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:13.680 align:middle line:10%
There is nothing you
can do to change that.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
can do to change that,

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth law is everything
changes except the laws.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
can do to change that.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything is here
and now which means

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that space and time, distance
are illusions, your illusions.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Time is a side effect of
your consciousness shifting

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
through billions of different
parallel versions of reality

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.530 align:middle line:90%
every single second.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.250 align:middle line:10%
Your fundamental, essential,
vibrational, signature

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:52.560 align:middle line:10%
frequency is already
attracting every single thing

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.520 align:middle line:10%
that is relevant for you
that you truly need in life.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.130 align:middle line:90%


01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to learn
to attract what you need.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Be the vibration that you prefer
in alignment with your truth,

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and let go of the
things that are blocking

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
what it is that your
truth is attracting,

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and you will flow and manifest
in an accelerated way.

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:21.150 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You exist, and you
cannot stop existing,

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
because existence is
your fundamental quality.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You can never
become nonexistent.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You can change and change
and change and change,

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
but you can never
become nonexistent.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Because by definition,
nonexistence doesn't exist.

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
We extend to you our
deep appreciation

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in allowing us this transmission

a fun and exciting good day.
