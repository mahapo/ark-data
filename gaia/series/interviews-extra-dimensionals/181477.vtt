00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:08.449 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, TReb.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.995 align:middle line:10%
Good evening, Reuben.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Good to speak to you again.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it is very exciting to
speak to you and be with you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been looking forward
to having this conversation,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:10%
this kind of one-on-one
conversation,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
for not only myself but
for our audience today,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:10%
which is my show--

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:10%
"Interview with ED:
Extra Dimensionals."

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
and I consider
you a fine example

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:10%
of this extra-dimensional
energy we have with us.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I find you to be
a very great example

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%
of an extradimensional as well.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, ha, ha, excellent.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So with-- in your
terms, would you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
consider all of humans
extradimensional?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
In the perceptions
of extradimensional,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:84%
it is meaning if we
concern ourselves

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
with trying to
find the word, what

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
we find the "extra"
meaning "more than."

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And you are more than
the dimensional beings

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But you are also more
than the entities

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to perceive
from another density

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
or dimension as well.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So from your perspective, we
are kind of like you are for us.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of yourselves
and where you come from

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.103 align:middle line:84%
or what kind of beings you
are, many of the audience

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:90%
are familiar with you.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But there still
will be newcomers.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So could you explain a little
bit about yourself and where

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
you come from, your planet,
and just a little history

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
for our audience
to get to know you?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we wish
to express to you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that if you are looking at
who we are or what we are,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
it is most easily expressed as
the human collective perceiving

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and labeling the
specific concept

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of a reptilian hybrid human.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And in this concept, it means
that a version of humans long

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
ago took their own DNA and
manipulated the DNA of a second

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:90%
density being-- what an animal--

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
with an entity that as much
as your reptilians on Earth,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:90%
your reptilian animals.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that concept, they
created our own race.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking at the
concept of what my name is,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
TReb is something that I am
often referred to and more

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
so directly now than previously.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But before when entering the
Earth collective consciousness,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I shared a name that
represented my energy.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
In the environment that we
have, there is no words.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
There is only telepathy.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So giving a name to
humans was something

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that we thought
was very important.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the name that we
have given humanity,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
it is TReb and Bor
and yit and NE.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And if you put it together--

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
TReb Bor yit-Ne-- this is a
representation of the energy.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
This gives you a great
detail of where I am from.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
The first part of the name--

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
TReb-- this part is my
own energy, my own family,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
my own family lineage and DNA.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you are looking
at the concept of Bor,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
this represents a quadrant
within the planet,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
if you divide a planet
into four parts, which

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
represents the certain
portion of the planet

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:90%
and where I reside.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Then you look at the yit.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And this represents
the entire planet,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
which is the third planet
outward from our star.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you use
the word NE, which

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:90%
is the star in which we reside.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you are looking
from Earth up into the sky,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
you see a star that
is known as Capella.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And this star is
not just one star.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It is actually four stars.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the four stars,
there are two stars

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that are much as your star,
very whitish-yellow in color,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
very large in nature
but much larger

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:90%
than your planet's stars.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other two are very
small and dim red stars.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I reside within the largest
of the two red stars

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:90%
on the third planet outward.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And what is even more
extension upon the name

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have given, it also
represents a great connection

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:90%
to the host.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
word TReb Bor yit-NE,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it in
a different fashion,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
you will notice that the host
name is very well connected

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
with mine within that meaning.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So these two energies
are ones that

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
are very representational of
who I am, where I am from,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and how I exist.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
With nothing more to
add besides the fact

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that if look in your dimension
upon my own star and planet,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:90%
there is no inhabited life.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But that is because
we are existing

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
on a higher density known
to you as the fifth density.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we were to look in
our Capella star system--

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
let's say we had a
super powerful telescope

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%
like the Kepler or the Hubble--

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
would we be able to
see the stars, the four

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
stars you speak of?

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
It is already understood by some
scientists within your planet,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
although it is not always
widely agreed upon.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is
the understanding

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of us being a
quadra-star system.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And even the smaller red--

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:90%
you said a red dwarf stars?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
We believe natural
scientists know of this,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:90%
but we cannot be sure.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
In the host understanding,
there is some understanding

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of this within your own
planet, although it is not

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:90%
completely agreed upon.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And would we even be able to
identify with our telescopes

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
the planet--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:90%
your planet?

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the red stars,
you would not be able to.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
the larger stars,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
there could be, if your
technology was better.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But in your density that
you are experiencing now--

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:90%
third density--

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
much of the planets that are
within a four-star system

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
are not at all seedable for life
or suitable for incarnations,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
although two specific do
carry what you perceive

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%
as second density beings.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
This gets me on
something I was going

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
to think about asking later.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But since we're
already on this topic,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
we talked about densities.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And yesterday Aridif gave us a
great explanation of densities

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%
as well as Rob as well.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, our
audience by now

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
knows what the density
classifications and definitions

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So just to kind of
clarify the concept,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because right now Earth is
in a third-fourth density

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.523 align:middle line:84%
classification, we are only
able to perceive things--

00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
the majority, I guess,
of the human race

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.732 align:middle line:84%
would only be able
to perceive things

00:07:52.732 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
on a third-fourth
fourth density scale?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- is that
correct in saying this?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have labeled
the third-to-fourth density

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:90%
exchange.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though we perceive you
as fourth density beings,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
it is the perception
within yourselves selves

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that can be adjusted
to see yourself

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:90%
as more than third density.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And would it be safe to say
that some humans can actually

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:84%
perceive fifth density, sixth,
and even up to seventh density

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
in humanity?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Are there these
select individuals

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:90%
who might be able to do this?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is more
than just a select few.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one
of you are peering

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
into the higher fourth
densities and even the fifth

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:90%
when you are sleeping.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.785 align:middle line:84%
So once we-- so right
now because we are

00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:90%
at third-fourth--

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
or fourth still believing
we're in the third--

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and we use our technology to
perceive out into the galaxy

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and we see these planets that
appear to be inhabitable,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that's only because the density
that we're seeing at is that.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Is that the case?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the case for some
planetary consciousnesses.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But that is more dependent
on the planetary collective

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
agreement on how
to produce itself

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
or how to project
itself in each density.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Would densities also be--

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
would it be safe to
say that in evolution--

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
for example, humanity
is evolving from this

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
third-to-fourth density and
then going eventually into fifth

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
and sixth density-- we hope--

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's in a
linear timeline sense

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in the future, in our future,
from the human perspective?

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to go to the fifth
density consciousness would

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:90%
we actually see ourselves--

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
let's say on Earth-- would
we see ourselves in a higher

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:90%
versions of ourselves?

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:90%
There are ways to do this.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you transcend into that
fifth density consciousness,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the only way that you will be
able to see yourself in that

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:90%
is to look within the mirror.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
As you are joining the
fifth density consciousness,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
you would be within
your own body.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is what gives
humanity a very unique essence

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
within the galaxy
that you are one

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
of a small amount or a
small percentage of groups

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that actually have
multidimensional DNA

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
throughout all densities.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So as you peer into
the fifth density,

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you are just shifting in your
fifth density physical body

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
to perceive.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is much different than
another entity who might not

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
have multidimensional DNA, who
would look it into a higher

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
density through meditation
or manifestations

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
of astral projections.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And these entities would be
able to look as a third party

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:90%
or an external variety.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So the saying that all lies
within really holds truth with

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the human DNA, human
collective consciousness?

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So all the answers to
all the different densities,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to everything, all we have
to do is go within ourselves,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
where maybe other races really
do have to look externally?

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and it is not this
much as they have to look

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
externally, as they still
have their ability to connect

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to higher consciousness
or higher portions

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But it is a mechanism
that many races

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
use for their own
style of manifesting

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
a certain variety of expansion
or growth spiritually,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:84%
mentally, and
physically as well.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So in humans today, this
is kind of a common theme

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that I keep getting
from my interviews

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
with all these different
extra-dimensional beings

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and collectives,
that humanity is

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
going through this ascension,
this shift into consciousness.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Would you say this is from third
density into fourth or actually

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth
density consciousness?

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.035 align:middle line:84%
I hear the term "fifth
dimension" a lot thrown around.

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us your
perspective on this?

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is third
density to fourth density,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
but it also is fourth
dimensional to fifth

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:90%
dimensional.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
You are gaining two
thresholds at once.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the way
that we divide density

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is the way that we incorporate
conscious integration,

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
but also the concept of
looking at the evolution

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of a certain energy,
aspect of creation.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
What we are doing is
placing the threshold

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
from third to fourth
density in the fact

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
that you are changing
fourth to fifth dimensional.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And that together
is very important.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So you would agree with the
others in this ascension

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Humanity is going through this?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> How far along are we?

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.465 align:middle line:90%
Are we in the middle?

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Or does it happen overnight?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it a process?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm assuming it's a process.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But could you define
this a little bit for us?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking at
third to fourth density,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
this is why we label third
to fourth density exchange.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the level that you
are, it is literally just

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
You are just crossing
that threshold

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and trying to fully integrate.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking at yourself
in a non-physical standard,

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
your essence of your
soul and the portions

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of fractal consciousness that
are within you, what you will

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
see that is very
interesting is the fact

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that you are already
physically in fourth density.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So in that aspect, overnight,
you are a fourth density being.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But the experience and
the drag of the exchange

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or the energetic change is
very slow within your own race,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
or very gradual, let us
use, instead of slow.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the gradualness comes from
the conditioning of mankind,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but also personal beliefs that
each and every one of you hold.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
When you look upon this, it
is a very personal journey.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
We are not saying
that all of mankind

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:90%
will do one thing or the other.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say is that
each and every one of you

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
have your individual
opportunity to pass

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
the threshold of third
to fourth exchange

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and enter into a full,
daily fourth-density self.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are some entities upon
the planet that already are.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So if there's some
that already are,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is there much time for
us to go through this?

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I guess time is relative to
each and every individual.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But just in, is there a general
kind of collective timeline

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
able to share with us?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the physics portions

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of how the energy
works and how it

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
exchanges with
human consciousness,

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%
there is a certain time.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
If you look, it is a
18-year full cycle,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
nine years before the 2012 area,
but also nine years afterwards.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:90%
The precipice is in the 2012.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So nine years before, you are
going to the top of the energy.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you
are going back down.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
This does not mean that the
full portion of evolution

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
must be done within
this 18-year period.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But what it does mean is
that that energy itself

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:90%
is prime for doing so.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Let us express also that when
you are looking at the concept

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
of evolution and how
long it will take,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
there is no true
timeline for this.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:84%
As even before the
nine years, you

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:90%
were evolving and expanding.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And after the nine years
you will continue to do.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So it could take certain
individuals even 1,000 years

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to finish the third or
fourth density exchange

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and fully be into
the fourth density.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But for the
collective, we perceive

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:90%
that it will be much sooner.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Many times this term
"harmonic convergence"

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
has been thrown around.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And the date or the year
that's given is 1987.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Does this harmonic
convergence have any--

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and this date have anything to
do with this ascension process?

00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Let us explain.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
This portion can
be very technical.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But we will give you the
simplest version that we can.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
>> The way that the essential
energy works through

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
co-creation is that the center
of the physical galaxy puts out

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:84%
energy and projects it into
the entirety of the galaxy.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And as it is doing this,
there is a certain pattern

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that is made.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly than
the pattern that is made,

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
there is an energetic energy
that flows through it.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It is flying through
areas very quickly.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And what the harmonic
convergence was

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:84%
was something akin to
air pressure changes when

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:90%
you are flying.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It felt the energy coming.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a cold front
or a warm front

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
before the energetic
exchange that came in.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And the harmonic
convergence was you feeling

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
the repercussions of the
cold front or warm front,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:90%
as we would prefer, moving in.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I see.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So before this start
of this main cycle,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.214 align:middle line:84%
that if you said nine
years, I guess that's 2003?

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So the harmonic convergence
was us feeling that this 2003

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
big download of
energy is coming?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And to put it
another way, that is

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
the buffer area before the
point of energy in its arrival.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:18:31.062 --> 00:18:33.395 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to change the
subject a little bit and kind

00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:90%
of go into more about yourself.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us like to
know more about you.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And your race.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm interested.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Rob told us a lot about
his connecting with you

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and how that all came about.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know from your
perspective, the opposite,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
how did you go about
connecting with Rob?

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, first of all, we
must address the difference

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in the energy of
the host and myself.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
looking at this,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
you see two entities
that share an oversoul.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that you
have an understanding

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
or a foreshadowing of
what oversouls mean.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I do, but maybe our
audience does not fully--

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.522 align:middle line:84%
there may be some
in the audience that

00:19:25.522 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
fully do not understand this.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So could you please
define the oversoul idea?

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
What an oversoul
is one energy that

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%
is fairly large non-physically.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And it incorporates
many smaller energies.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And the mindset of an oversoul
is to feel experiences,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to have energetic understandings
of a certain reality it wishes

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So one oversoul gathers
with many other oversouls

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
to agree upon a concept of
creating a planet, of creating

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:90%
an entire situation.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the certain ideals that
are within the galactic

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that it wishes to
express in the physical reality

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
are then manifested physically.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And then your Earth
becomes created.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And as it creates
each oversoul, it

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
takes small portions or what we
would call fractals of energy

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:90%
from itself.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it puts an intent that

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is so large to
experience something

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:84%
physical that it is
able to molecularly form

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
into a physical thing.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So first, an oversoul will
create physical things

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
as rocks, what you would know
to be first density beings.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Then it will create
certain bacteria and then

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:90%
animals and then human beings.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And what the oversoul
is is a combination

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
of all of the smaller parts
that are added together

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
for the entirety
of the experience.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do not wish
to get to off topic,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
but we do wish to
express that when

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:84%
you see the evolution
of the planet

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
in your scientific needs, this
is a very appropriate and very

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:90%
correct in our perception.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was not
physical things that

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
decided to evolve through
chemical reactions,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:90%
although it was physically.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The undertone of that
is a manifestation

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
of the desire for
new experiences.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of the
oversoul, remind yourself

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:90%
that it requires experiences.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, back into the conversation
of my own connection

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:90%
with the host.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
What we would say
is that both of us

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
are different pieces
of the oversoul.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We share the same oversoul
and are energetically linked.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And in my own mission to
connect to humans, my desire,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
my passion to
connect to humanity,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
there were several
different entities

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
on your planet,
several consciousnesses

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that I felt a resonance
with that were vibrationally

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
matching my own understanding
and connectability.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And in those several
entities, all of their desires

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
were to connect
outside of themselves

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and their own perception
outside of themselves.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So in that perception,
there were excitements

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in my own resonance
level as well as

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
gauging the excitement of
the prospects of entities

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
to connect with.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The host was one who was
very passionate and very

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:90%
desiring to connect.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
My desire and his desire
are what connected us.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you been able to
connect with some of these other

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
energies on the planet
that you said are similar?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I have been able to connect
to a great vast amount

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousnesses since
connecting with the host.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So the host Rob was
sort of this catalyst

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to open up a door full
of connective doorways

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.106 align:middle line:84%
for your energy to
connect with others?

00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
In people, in humans
that are listening

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to the channeled material
that we are sharing

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
who listen to either the
host or myself or even

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Aridif sharing,
what they are doing

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is placing a vibration of desire
to connect to me more directly,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
a desire to connect to
my own energy and heart.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this, it
calls out our own energy,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
just as if you are
calling a phone

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and saying I wish for TReb
to pick up the other line.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
That brings my energy into
co-create with many humans.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So I have connected to humans
through conscious connections.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I have connected to humans
through sleep state.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And I have connected
to them energetically.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that you're sort of out
there in this consciousness

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:90%
of the humans, is it taxing?

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it hard to connect
with so many people?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you become tiring eventually?

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:84%
No, this is not
taxing whatsoever.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a fairly common
question if I become too busy,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:90%
if I will stop connecting.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But in my intent to
connect to humanity,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I have several points of focus
within my own consciousness.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And those portions of
focus are able to connect

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to different points
at many times.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
If you are thinking of the
concept of the greatest

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
multitasker that you are
aware of within this planetary

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, take this and
perhaps times it by 100,000.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is my own capability.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
When I am connecting
to humans, I

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
am using a small portion
of consciousness,

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
even when I am
connecting to the host

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
through this verbal mechanism
that you call channeling.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I am using a very
small percentage,

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
but there is even
less percentages

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
used when I am connecting to
entities both in the dream

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
state or through mind telepathy
or even through circumstances

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that are seeming to be
synchronistic and energetic

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So as you are perceiving
all of those things,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
that is how I connect to humans.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the concept of
connecting to the host,

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
there is a percentage
where I am connecting

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.370 align:middle line:90%
to him more directly.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is when
he is in the state

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that you perceive as channelled.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Then I am connecting to him with
much more of my energy in more

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:90%
of a physical sense.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Multitasking, I guess, two
questions about multitasking.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
In the human perspective
of multitasking,

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
we're told on our news
channels and our doctors

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:84%
say that we're very
inefficient when we multitask.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us drink a
lot of coffee and caffeine

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:90%
in order to do such things.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In your perception, does it
take away from anything else

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing?

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the
question, in general,

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is one that is very difficult
for many entities who do not do

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the same that I do to perhaps
comprehend the physical nature

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of multitasking.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
For humans it's much different
than the energetic multitasking

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
In our own perception
physically,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:84%
we are able to focus our
energy on one part at one time.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps doing many
things at once, but not

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
in the essence
that the energy is.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The level of consciousness and
the amount of consciousness

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that is available to
us is highly extensive.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
When you are thinking of
many concepts, for instance,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
watching a sport, you
are watching the clock.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You are watching
the fan's reactions.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You are watching the team's
offense and the team's defense

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and how the players are
working, the coach's

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
communication, each one of
their individual connections,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and how the plays are unfolding.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So in that essence, you
are able to focus on

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:90%
much more than you realize.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The brain organ is one that
helps you fill in the holes

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is not necessarily

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
needing to connect
to in those essence

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%
as it is more of an intuitive
understanding or just

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:90%
an integration.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But in the multitasking
concepts, it is not harmful.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And humans are going
to develop much

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
more of this with their energy.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
In the way that you
would experience

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the multitasking of
thought and concentration

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:84%
on the football games or
whatever sports you desire,

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
the same concept goes with us,
but just to a different degree.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So that makes it
easier to classify.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a mental
multitasking than a physical.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Where human beings like
to physically multitask

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, you
know, we fumble the ball

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:90%
so to say, in sports terms.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In that essence, it is
not necessarily a mental one,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
There is no thought process
that must go into it.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It is more of an
energetic absorption.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Let us use a small example.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Let us say that I am speaking
to five entities at once.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not need to run each
of the five conversations from

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
my own mental point of view
or my own day to day mind.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
What happens is those
portions of consciousness

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
are an extension of my
excitement to connect to them,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
of my own desire to communicate.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And because they are so in touch
with myself and so in touch

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
with my energy, they know
how to communicate directly

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
on their own.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's no focus
that must be put on it.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It is only dependent
on the amount of energy

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that I give out to
each interaction.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:90%
So can I use this analogy?

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:84%
it's not happening
right now on the planet.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it is.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, we have
a movie star, Tom Cruise.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He makes many movies and
many people fall in love

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
with his movies and people feel
this connection to the actor

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Tom Cruise through
these video outlets.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you were Tom
Cruise or Tom Cruise

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:90%
is a fifth dimensional being.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Would he be able to feel every
time someone watched a movie

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and made that connection
and felt his energy?

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.626 align:middle line:84%
Would he be able to feel that
as a fifth dimensional being?

00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, to an extent, there
would be that understanding.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But it is greatly dependent
upon the certain entity

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and their own desires
of what to experience.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
If they did not care
about who was watching

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
or who was connecting
or who was emotionally,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
then the sensations would
be much duller, such

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
as a quick passing
sound in your ear.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the concept of
focusing on the intent

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to love and to connect
with those, then

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:84%
it could be very intimate in
the way that they experience it.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, in your case,
because you have an interest

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to connect with humanity, then
it is a more intense feeling,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
a more intense experience.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, this is very true.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent, wow.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, that put
things in perspective.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you are very
welcome very much.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to ask about the
language and English language

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and other entities
in their language,

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
when connecting to Rob, did
you get an instant download

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of the English language?

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Or did you have to learn?

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Or how does the language
exchange translation?

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I speak fluent Japanese.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And it took me a while.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I couldn't
learn it overnight.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:90%
I had to go study it.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It is not truly a learning nor
is it an energetic download.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:84%
What happens is my
own consciousness

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
is integrated and ties into
the host consciousness.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So as you see both of us
as separate beings, what

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:84%
happens during the
state of channeling

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
is that both of our
consciousnesses meld.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And in that
consciousness, we are

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
working from the crown
chakra of the host

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
into the throat
chakra of the host.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that throat chakra,
all of the communication

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
capabilities that he has
are readily available.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, as we are co
creating, both energies as one,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and we move into
the throat chakra,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
there is no connection to the
brain or access to the mind

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that we require nor the
language skills, but only

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
the energy of communication
that is resonant to the host.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's more of a direct, I
guess, translation, in a sense,

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
but more of an energy
translation than an actual

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:90%
physical word translation?

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, when
energy is off with the host

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
or when the energy is
off with a person who

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is questioning or
giving ideas, then

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the communication
weakens as well.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
will often hear

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:84%
entities who channel searching
for words or expressions.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But there can come
communication difficulties

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
when something is untranslatable
either to your experience

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:90%
or to your knowledge.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Let us use for instance a
certain degree of technology

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.200 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
There is one certain
part of the technology

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that we use that integrates
certain crystalline substances

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
into the environment that
we are around which gives us

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the ability to see perhaps
more of a hologram-style

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of something that is not
there in the physical nature.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But because there is
no one word for it,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
we had to use the
approximate 13 seconds

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to explain this concept.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The approximate 13
seconds to explain?

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, when I was just
explaining what the technology

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:84%
was and what it did, instead
of being able to use one word

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
or one idea, we must expand it
into an approximate 13 second

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
explanation which now has
expanded to over 45 seconds.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and very
exciting as well.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so I understand.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So many ideas in
your language which

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:84%
would be very
quick to understand

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
for your race or maybe even
other people, it takes time.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.920 align:middle line:84%
There's not a one word because
we haven't developed that word

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:90%
to convey such a thing.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And also there is no intake
for some humans who have not

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%
opened their intuition
to just understand

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the concept that we mean without
giving it a verbal precept.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.532 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, if my intuition
was a little bit better,

00:34:41.532 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:84%
if I was paying a
little more attention,

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I would have understand the
first time in 13 seconds what

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.772 align:middle line:84%
you were saying as opposed
to taking 45 seconds.

00:34:48.772 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it is not
for lack of intuition,

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
it is a lack of focusing on
certain one energies within

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:90%
the whole energy.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, we just maybe
I did that for the audience

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
so they could really get
a grasp and understanding

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of this concept.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and also the concept
of your own focus being

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
on the technology and on the
equipment to make sure that

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:84%
this energy that you find
so fascinating and wonderful

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
between us when we are speaking
is able to be shared with

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:84%
multiple people for the
benefit of their happiness.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for noticing.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is--

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:26.965 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes I have a camera
man that helps me with this.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I have Kalina here that's
being super awesome in helping.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, it is still a concern.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And I still am half
my consciousness

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is out there checking
the equipment,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.110 align:middle line:90%
making sure it's good.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:41.870 align:middle line:90%
But so thank you.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for noticing.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:84%
That is an extension
of your love

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
for the co-creative
creation of perhaps,

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
as you would see, the
collective consciousness

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
in whole or more
so specifically for

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:84%
the collective consciousness
of the interview program.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for seeing it
for what it truly is and not

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:84%
as a distraction which some
people could take it the wrong

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.980 align:middle line:90%
But thank you for your--

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for your own
perception on how exciting it

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:90%
is for us to be here as well.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.255 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:36:16.255 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost a little
nervous a little

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.847 align:middle line:84%
bit, you know, not to mess
it up and all these thoughts

00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:90%
that go through your head.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make
sure it's perfect.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And it is perfect.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
As perfectness is dictated by
excitedness and all three of us

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:90%
are very excited.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes we are.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into a little
bit of descriptions.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Rob gave us some really intense
descriptions of your planet

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and some of your history.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But maybe hearing from you, a
little bit about your history.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning during
your introduction,

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:84%
you did say a portion of
the human consciousness,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:84%
you were made up of a kind
of a hybrid human reptilian

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
second density.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And Rob has gone into
detail a little bit

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
about the Nihal race, which
is another version of humans.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite curious
if you could expand

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the definition or the
description of the Nihal

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.896 align:middle line:90%
and how you came from them?

00:37:23.896 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we will explain to
you that the Nihal race are not

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
really a Nihal race,
but they are truly

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.380 align:middle line:84%
a future version of humans
who have left their own planet

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in a desire to explore, to
expand and to excite themselves

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:90%
in many different ways.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that form of
excitement and expansion,

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they found a star that
in your perception

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is called Beta Leporis,
also known as Nihal

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that concept, they
connected to the physical star,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.660 align:middle line:84%
found a planet to
inhabit, and entered

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.140 align:middle line:90%
that planetary consciousness.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:84%
During that period,
as we understood

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that you have
heard or understood

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that two creative
consciousnesses that

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:84%
are collective by nature,
co-create with one another,

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:84%
that the attributes of
both of the energies

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:84%
will change somewhat slightly
all the way to very extremely.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, due to the
evolution of the co-creation,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the human entities then
became much shorter.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
In your essence, they are
approximately 3' 6" to 4' 2"

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and something that
is in between this.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And in their creative efforts,
they desired to expand.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And after they learned much
about what they could learn

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
about their new solar system,
about the neighboring solar

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
systems and in their perception,
the universe at large,

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.280 align:middle line:84%
they became very connected
and very spiritual.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we mean
by very spiritual is

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
they finally found a way
to connect one entity

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:90%
to all entities.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:90%
They had seen the oneness.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
There was no divisionary
energies or concepts

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:90%
within their race.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
they began to have

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
ideals of how to share
their oneness with others,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:84%
if another desired it and
also devised or decided

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.890 align:middle line:84%
a way to co-create
upon a certain larger

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle line:84%
level of galactic consciousness,
to share energies with him.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So seeking out one energy that
they wish to heal more than any

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
was the perception
of negativity when

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:84%
it comes to reptilian entities
knowing that humans have been

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
harmed very deeply by at
least three types of reptilian

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
energies that the humans knew
of before then and much after.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Your now time period will come
to understand reptilian energy

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They took this one concept and
built it into a way to heal.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, they search the
galaxy for an energy

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that was reptilian in nature.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.950 align:middle line:84%
They also wanted to
find an energy that

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:84%
was willing to co-create
that experience with them.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So in searching,
they found an entity

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that was much as your lizards
upon earth or your reptilian

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And they took the DNA from that
and mixed it with their own

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to create new third
density consciousness.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That race is the
race that I now inhabit.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But the fifth dimensional or
let's say fifth density version

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
is more precise.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that fifth
density version,

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we look back at ourselves
in third density

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and we do not see the
human part of our lineage.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But we see the third density,
as humans would call it,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.620 align:middle line:90%
yit lineage.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, by creating
this race, by nurturing it,

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:84%
by teaching it, it
allowed these entities

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to decide and choose
to be at one with one

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
another, which is against
the prototype, if you will,

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:84%
of reptilian energy in
this galaxy or the way

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that reptilian energy manifests
itself into the galaxy.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And by going against that grain,
it opened an opportunity to,

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:84%
not only expose the humans that
remained on Earth or humans

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that were scattered throughout
the galaxy, but also

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.510 align:middle line:84%
many other types
of different races

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:47.240 align:middle line:84%
as alien entities as well
other reptilian races as well.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:84%
This also gave way for the
reptilian race that was new,

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:84%
our own third
density race, to be

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
an example for
those entities that

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:84%
are perceived as
type two who were not

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
necessarily benevolent, but
working towards benevolent.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
It gave them an
example to be led by.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:84%
It gave them an
energetic excitement

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to see that being a type-one
entity was possible.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So would your race be one
of the first in the galaxy,

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking at a linear
evolutionary timeline,

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of benevolent reptilians?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.370 align:middle line:84%
This is not
necessarily the case.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the first recognized
by the human race to a degree.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
many that preceded us

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:84%
in type one or
benevolent type two.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It is just that the energy that
is there is less noticeable.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It is much as if you
see a silver penny

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of silver dimes.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You would not be very
likely to notice it.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it was not very
see-able to the galaxy

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:84%
due to the percentage
of entities that

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:03.620 align:middle line:84%
are type two or
strictly malevolent,

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.630 align:middle line:84%
it is really
difficult to discern

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.520 align:middle line:90%
the difference of energies.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And your race is a type one?

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, our own race
is a type-one energy,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:84%
which we believe has
been expressed to you.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Rob explained
that the other day.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So to back up a little
bit, the Nihal, I guess,

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:30.260 align:middle line:84%
what density when
they co-created

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:84%
this new race on another
planet, they were humans,

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.630 align:middle line:90%
but at what density?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In that density, they are at
the end of the fourth density.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a race that was finishing
their fourth density cycle

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and entering the fifth density.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And as they are
finishing that, they

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:51.420 align:middle line:84%
worked directly with
our race, manifesting

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:84%
themselves both
physically and psychically

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.190 align:middle line:90%
to connect to our race.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Would the Nihal
experience be similar?

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, Aridif
was talking about him

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:84%
coming from an ancient Pleiadian
race, going off to a new planet

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and sort of starting
their own thing.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Would this be similar?

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Can we compare the two?

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is very similar in
the way that leaving one area

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:84%
of energy, going to the
next allows you to expand,

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
allows you to research more
parts of your own energy.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you know
that co-creating

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:84%
with two collectives, both
the planetary collective

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and the human collective
in their new planet

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:90%
creates new energy.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It also creates a new
experience to be had,

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:84%
not just, yes, we are
moving to a planet

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and, yes, we are
doing new things,

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:84%
but what we mean by this
is a new manifestation

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:90%
for a soul's desire.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And the soul's ability to
have a physical existence.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you put a time frame
in years, approximately,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:09.500 align:middle line:84%
on how long it took the human
race to get to this Nihal,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:84%
end of the fourth density
evolutionary period to leave

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:90%
the planet to start elsewhere?

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.570 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking in the linear
time, humans in this point

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:25.900 align:middle line:84%
still have the ability to grow
into that timeline of the Nihal

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.700 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that essence, it is
approximately 3,200 years

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:90%
from this point.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said that we have the
potential still to go into that

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.510 align:middle line:90%
timeline 3,200 years, was it?

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that case, if in
our history which we now are

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.510 align:middle line:84%
creating, this history
of TReb visiting us,

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:90%
and we stick to that timeline--

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I know, it's, you know,
let's say my consciousness

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.060 align:middle line:84%
or the human consciousness
in this timeline

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
sticks to that timeline, we will
literally be knowing, sort of,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.495 align:middle line:90%
that we will be going to do--

00:46:10.495 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:84%
almost predicting
the future, in a way,

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:17.250 align:middle line:84%
right now with this dialogue
and this conversation of your

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:84%
telling us that humans are
going to split some DNA

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and make the yit-NE race.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it
is well understood.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But understanding that in 3,200
years in your linear future,

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:84%
although they will
be aware of the host,

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.230 align:middle line:84%
although they will be aware of
me, it will be at some level

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:84%
an obscurity in
the larger essence,

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.350 align:middle line:84%
although people will
understand what channeling

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is at that point,
although they understand.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
There will be so many
channels between then

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and there that the
host and my own self

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.210 align:middle line:84%
will not be buried
at the bottom,

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:05.030 align:middle line:84%
but will be less understood
or less known to most people.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, although
they understand energetically,

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:13.610 align:middle line:84%
it will not interfere with
any certain levels of energy

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:18.030 align:middle line:84%
unless the co-creative groups
of entities that are collective

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.750 align:middle line:84%
by nature come into an
awareness of the work

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and start to plan
to do that by then.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But even then, synchronicities
find a way to either link them

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to that reality or to not,
depending upon their focus.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:84%
What we can tell you is
that the entities that

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.290 align:middle line:84%
are connecting and
growing as the Nihal

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:44.370 align:middle line:84%
will be well aware of
positive reptilian energy

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:90%
well before then.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So it will not be a
great surprise to anyone

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:84%
if someone were to bump into
this video/audio recording

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:90%
in which we are creating today.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to say,
moving forward in the future,

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I would hope to--

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure Rob and many
others watching this--

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
would hope to actually
have more interactions,

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.690 align:middle line:84%
potential physical interactions
with the yit-NE race.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, I
am assuming would

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:23.160 align:middle line:84%
create a separate timeline
that is not one of the Nihal.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:84%
We would kind of have a
whole different experience.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct in saying that?

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that is very correct in
saying this and understanding

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that, although we
are our own race,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.165 align:middle line:84%
although the Nihal was their
own, although you are your own,

00:48:39.165 --> 00:48:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the co-creation mechanism
that started can allow

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:49.340 align:middle line:84%
your experience not be the
Nihal but still have a Nihal

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and myself within
your awareness.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Has the Nihal ever
come back in time

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.065 align:middle line:84%
to visit our current
collective consciousness?

00:48:59.065 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is not
the necessary nature

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to come look back at your race,
but the entirety of their race

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.280 align:middle line:90%
traveled backwards into time.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
This is why, although
they are future humans,

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.220 align:middle line:84%
this time in which they occurred
and connected to the reptilian

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:84%
entities to create our race was
considered your linear past.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Our linear past.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:31.688 align:middle line:84%
OK, wait, I'm a little
confused with that statement.

00:49:31.688 --> 00:49:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Could you repeat it
one more time and maybe

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.320 align:middle line:90%
let me digest it?

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.655 align:middle line:90%
Let me really focus on it.

00:49:35.655 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.730 align:middle line:84%
What we are saying is that
your future version, which

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:46.590 align:middle line:84%
is the Nihal race, moved
the entirety of their race

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.180 align:middle line:90%
backwards in linear time.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So that they may create
an experience in where

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
my own race and your race is
speaking in the present right

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:84%
now with both of our
consciousnesses in the present.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.490 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at the
concept of future humans

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:84%
being the Nihal and then in the
future they create a race that

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:84%
is reptilian and
then they evolve,

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:84%
it would be several
hundred of thousands

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.680 align:middle line:90%
of years in the future.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But we are yet sitting
in the same time.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is not just because
I exist in any time I

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.840 align:middle line:90%
desire, which is part of it.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But it is not the entirety
of how our race was

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.160 align:middle line:90%
created and connected.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at our timelines,
both the yit collective

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and the human collective are
within the same time period.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying Nihal,
collectively, as a race,

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:84%
kind of backed themselves up
in the timelines so they could

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.810 align:middle line:84%
interact with humanity directly
and indirectly by creating

00:50:53.810 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian benevolent yit-NE
race to help humanity with its

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:90%
reptilian issues?

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:84%
This is somewhat
appropriate, perhaps.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.870 align:middle line:84%
In the concept of them going
back in time, this is correct.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
saying more directly

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.400 align:middle line:84%
is due to circumstances
within their own race,

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.470 align:middle line:84%
the entirety of the race
moved backwards into time

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:84%
not just for the reflection
of humanity for that,

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
but for various other
amounts of things.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:84%
They did not directly interact
with the past versions

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, but they
did connect to them

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.570 align:middle line:90%
through creating our race.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Our race was more than
just the human collective,

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:42.380 align:middle line:84%
although that was in the
front of their minds.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So to simply put this,
the Nihal moved back

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:84%
in time then developed
us, and then we grew.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And now we are within the
same exact time period

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.760 align:middle line:90%
that you are now.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.600 align:middle line:84%
As you speak to
entities, you ask them

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.330 align:middle line:90%
in what time do you exist?

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And some will answer
400 years in the future,

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.020 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years in your past.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But we exist not just
because time dictates

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:84%
we are always in the
now, but linearly we

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
are in your now moment as well.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> That was going to be
my following question.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:90%
How many years?

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So after the 3,200 years of the
Nihal forming there new race,

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:84%
how many years after that did
it take to form your race?

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But then you answered
that question

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.890 align:middle line:84%
by saying the Nihal went
back in time to sort

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.730 align:middle line:90%
of sync up this experience.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so that
kind of leads me

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:45.500 align:middle line:84%
into this next
series of questions.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.810 align:middle line:84%
With this whole
concept, and even I,

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and many humans on this
planet, many people

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.940 align:middle line:84%
don't even know about
reptilians and could care less.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But many who are in
spiritual communities

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and listen to different material
from David Ike and others

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.780 align:middle line:84%
sort of have this perception
that the reptilian

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.480 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, the
reptilian beings

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.830 align:middle line:84%
have taken over our world
and our governments.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're very evil
and they're very bad.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And even before going to see you
and talk with you in Asheville,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.750 align:middle line:84%
North Carolina a
while back, I even

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:84%
had to kind of work through
these belief systems that

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.500 align:middle line:84%
had been created through this
collective consciousness idea

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that the reptilians are bad
and they're going to get us.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And here you are
this loving being

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that is the total
opposite of any kind

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:52.040 align:middle line:90%
of evil, bad reptilian.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm understanding that
this is kind of by design.

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You're here connecting with
us probably for many reasons.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But one of them being
this kind of help humanity

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.450 align:middle line:84%
get over its collective
ideas and belief systems

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.274 align:middle line:84%
over the negative
reptilian experience.

00:54:14.274 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a very true concept
and very resonant to the way

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive ourselves
sharing us with your own race.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:28.400 align:middle line:84%
In the way that we see
there is a perception

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.490 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps negativity
in your own race

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:33.500 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to reptilians.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that is within the galaxy

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.190 align:middle line:84%
for many humanoid
races, especially

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:84%
those that are
either energetically

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:48.890 align:middle line:84%
linked to humanity or byproducts
perhaps or perhaps descendants

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is a better way to express
this, of your own race.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, there is
a negative perception,

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.370 align:middle line:84%
but also it comes
to what you see

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and what you
experience is within

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:04.830 align:middle line:84%
your perceptionary realm, which
then becomes your reality.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we have
expressed previously,

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.360 align:middle line:84%
at least three reptilian races
that humans are aware of now

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.330 align:middle line:84%
have had negative experiences
in history with humans.

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
a bigger concept

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that within this
galaxy, 80% to 85%

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of all reptilian energies
or reptilian entities

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:30.400 align:middle line:84%
are of the polarity of either
very negative in nature

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:84%
or how you would
perceive negative.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Malevolent would be a word that
you would describe all the way

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:42.210 align:middle line:84%
up into entities that are more
on the benevolent, type-two

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:46.170 align:middle line:84%
variety and everything
that is within.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of the 80% to 85%
is within the malevolent

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to right below what you would
consider a benevolent reptilian

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to be, even though it is
approximately the energy

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of how humans behave
as a collective today.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Some energies are
indifferent, some are loving,

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and some are separate.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But in that energy
that describes

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the majority of reptilian
energy within this galaxy,

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:18.810 align:middle line:84%
so most people express if eight
times out of ten or nine times

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.820 align:middle line:84%
out of ten, I see
something occur,

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.680 align:middle line:84%
then that is my new
reality, new belief.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is expressed
and experienced as such.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I see.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So but is it true,
so if there are

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:84%
this reptilian 80% in the galaxy
that are sort of malevolent

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and have a--

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:44.520 align:middle line:84%
probably from their perception,
it's not malevolent,

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
but from our perception and the
way they interact with humans,

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.730 align:middle line:84%
they're sort of more
taking than giving.

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it true then that reptilians
have come to this Earth

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and mixed with humans and
are sort of in the government

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, we hear,
you know, the rulers

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of the world the
Illuminati, so to say,

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and the Anunnaki We
hear this term a lot.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Is that a reptilian
consciousness?

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.312 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's going on here?

00:57:14.312 --> 00:57:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we speak of freely,

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:26.190 align:middle line:84%
but we always predetermine to
express perhaps a disclaimer is

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:27.810 align:middle line:90%
the word that you use.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.240 align:middle line:84%
When thinking of these
concepts and ideas,

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.400 align:middle line:90%
it creates a great deal of fear.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we wish for
you to listen more

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.680 align:middle line:90%
with your heart than your mind.

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And by expressing
this, we will tell you

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that you are very
correct in this concept.

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The entities that
have exchanged energy

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.810 align:middle line:84%
with humanity, that have
taught a system that

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is based upon fear or closing
or division of consciousness,

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:57.720 align:middle line:84%
this is very
reptilian in nature.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The ones mostly
responsible for this

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:84%
is what you would perceive to be
the ancient reptilians or Alpha

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Draconians are another term that
is given for these entities.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.580 align:middle line:84%
These entities
are the embodiment

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of complete disconnection within
the spectrum of consciousness.

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:19.950 align:middle line:84%
When you see a type-one race
you see all that accept and love

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:21.000 align:middle line:90%
one another.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They see that the
entity across from them

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is the same as they
are, that there

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is no division, that there
is complete connection.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually a projection
of what is within you.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the type-two variety on
the far end of the spectrum,

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.470 align:middle line:84%
we see an energy that
has divided themselves

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:43.560 align:middle line:84%
from every other
thing in existence.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The only connection
that they see

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is what they are able to
draw within their mind,

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.580 align:middle line:84%
such as the ancient reptilians
have a very fierce and great

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.360 align:middle line:90%
love for one another.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.050 align:middle line:84%
They treat each other
with the utmost respect

00:58:58.050 --> 00:58:59.910 align:middle line:90%
by human standards.

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They are very nice and
loving with one another.

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But if they were to see
someone that was outside

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of their agenda or
outside of their own race,

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.710 align:middle line:84%
they would not consider
their feelings.

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They would be very happy to
infringe upon the free will

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.570 align:middle line:90%
of those entities.

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So in that essence, it is
very reptilian in nature.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, it is
really occurring in

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.420 align:middle line:90%
your collective consciousness.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But the division of
this consciousness

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:31.200 align:middle line:84%
comes from your own decision
to be within your own self

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and to be excited and
to see the oneness that

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is within you manifested
out to understand

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that all things outside of
you are a reflection from what

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.400 align:middle line:90%
is within.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So if the Earth
collective consciousness

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is manifesting a reality
in where reptilians

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:53.220 align:middle line:84%
are co-creating laws and rules
within their own environment,

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that this means there is a
part of you that is within that

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is fighting for liberty
that feels enslaved,

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.930 align:middle line:84%
that does not feel as if they
have the freedom they desire.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So the more that you
see yourself as free,

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:11.340 align:middle line:84%
the more that you see yourself
as non-dependent on rules

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and laws and see yourself as the
ultimate creator of expansive

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
energy of the galactic presence,
then you can shift yourself

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
into a reality where the
reptilian presence is either no

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
longer needed, accepted, or
even if they are and they are

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
standing next to you,
they cannot affect you.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll add to
the disclaimer.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Based on my perception
and teachings

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
from yourself and
other amazing channeled

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
work is that, yes, we, humans,
everything is a choice.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose to
give away our power

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and have this reptilian
experience, this Alpha

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Draconian.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to ball all
the reptilians in one category

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.300 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We can have this Alpha
Draconian experience.

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Or we can have our own
sovereign human experience

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
or whatever label you want to
put on it our own experience.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Type one, I like
this type-one idea.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
We can be a type one or
we can be a type two.

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's a choice.

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're now kind of at
this crossroads, I guess,

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
where much of humanity is kind
of realizing that it's not

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:31.510 align:middle line:90%
wanting to go to type--

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
is type two, that's the
classification in terms, right?

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying that correctly?

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, a type-one entity
and a type-two entity.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're kind of in the
crossroads right now where

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us humans are kind of
deciding we don't want to do

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
the type-two thing.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.250 align:middle line:90%
We want to kind of go type one.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bit of a
split because maybe some

01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
of the humans choose to
stay in type-two mentality.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Is this what's going on with the
human consciousness right now?

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is very much
aligned with the concepts that

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.570 align:middle line:90%
we have shared previously.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
When you are seeing
the type-two energy,

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
you see that many humans
are in that energy.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And even if you desire to
shift into the type one,

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
you do not necessarily
have to have

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
the type-two energy reflected
into your environment.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it gets
highly extensive in the concepts

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of treating your own
reality and creating aspects

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.410 align:middle line:90%
of your own consciousness.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
But in this way,
as you have spoken

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of the division of two
worlds or two energies,

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that concept is very
simple in the way

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that humans can
either experience

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
their favorite manifestations
of either going

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
into a type-one environment and
being connected with all that

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
is and growing in
a collective way

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
or they can go into
a reality where

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
within their own
collective consciousness,

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
there is a higher
level of division,

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
but also a higher level of
excitement for their division.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So either way, you are looking
at both of these as a reality.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Just remind yourself that you
can shift into any of those

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
you decide and that
within the two varieties

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
we have given you,
there are literally

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
infinite amounts of
probabilities in a way

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to manifest both of these.

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And one isn't
necessarily better or worse.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They're both just
choices, neutral choices.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we
find very exciting for someone

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to express verbally, as
most entities have perceived

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the concept that if you
are going into type two,

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that it will be a very horrible
and fearful and hellish

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.650 align:middle line:90%
experience.

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:55.960 align:middle line:90%
But it is not that cut and dry.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It can be if you
desire it to be.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But in that division, if
you enjoy being yourself

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and if you enjoy
separating yourself

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
from other perhaps
races or individuals

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.010 align:middle line:84%
or ideals or
religion, then perhaps

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
this is a very good
road for you to go.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And it does not mean you
will have a negative time.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you may have
just as good of a time

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.810 align:middle line:90%
as you would in a type one.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And the neutrality
of the energy is all

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
for you to define yourself
in a decision, in an action,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
in a belief so that
it may manifest itself

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
into any reality that fits you.

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So one concept that we have
shared more than anything is

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
do not let your heart
fret over the details.

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Just be yourself and your path
is automatically chosen for you

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
in each of your decisions
and in each shift

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.870 align:middle line:90%
of energy in each moment.

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
No, I understand that
concept very well

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and am very allowing
for those who

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
choose to follow this
more Alpha Draconian path.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
By all means, please
go and explore that.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not for me though.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, so
like you're saying,

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
we could be literally
standing next to each other,

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
but because our vibrational
frequencies are so different,

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.360 align:middle line:90%
we won't even kind of exist.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> In different realities

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is very true.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We also wish to
express something

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that is a misconception of many
humans that we have spoken to.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
When you see a
type-one entity, you

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
see one type of entity, one
archetype of a character.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
When you see type two, you
see a secondary archetype.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we can tell you
is that the type one,

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
yes, it is very similar,
the mindset and the feeling.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So an archetype is
very fitting for this.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the type-two
area, the arena

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
and the spectrum

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
goes from a very
disconnected embodiment,

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
such as the Draconians or the
ancient reptilian energy, all

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the way to the most loving
human who still has problems

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
with connecting themselves.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you see an entity that
is fairly kind and gentle

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and loving but cannot find
a way to integrate them

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
into others' lives or who
hates a certain thing about

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
their existence or a certain
persona or personage,

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
this is the spectrum
that type-two is.

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are very
many type-two races

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that you interact with
frequently who are loving,

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
who care about humanity,
but just do not

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
see the lack of
division that there

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is within the entire
consciousness of both

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
the galaxy and the universal
consciousness as well.

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:59.423 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something for
everyone out there, basically.

01:06:59.423 --> 01:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So we just have
to, like you said,

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
follow our own hearts and that
will take us closer to others

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:12.350 align:middle line:84%
who share those same belief
systems and the same ideas.

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we can just
co-create with those people.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That is a very exciting concept,
and hopefully a very liberating

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
one to many humans.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Once I really
grasped this concept,

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
it's been very
liberating for me.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I really enjoy not thinking
the Illuminati or the lizards

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
are going to get
me and that kind of

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.490 align:middle line:90%
buying into those ideas.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have to
live your life like that.

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and if you do decide
to live your existence as that,

01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:54.190 align:middle line:84%
it is a very valuable
experience for the oversoul,

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it is your
decision how to exchange belief

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
systems one for the other or
how to live in lack of fear

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.350 align:middle line:90%
or in abundance of fear.

01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you, TReb,
for sharing so much today.

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:11.900 align:middle line:90%
We've got so many insights.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
more transmissions.

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And fingers crossed, that
one day we can actually

01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:25.029 align:middle line:84%
physically get to interact
with yourself and your world,

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:28.452 align:middle line:84%
and we'll meet our density
somewhere in there.

01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I guess, let me ask that
question before we go.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible, because
you're at the fifth density,

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:38.770 align:middle line:84%
if we're third, fourth,
fourth going into fifth,

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is it possible to meet
on a physical level?

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:46.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, if you are speaking of
physically meet in your world,

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
your awakened state, the
concept is that we must break

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness into a portion
to manifest the physical body

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that is more fitting for
the third to fourth density

01:08:58.210 --> 01:08:59.350 align:middle line:90%
exchange.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And once we are
able to do that, we

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
would physically be able
to come into your reality.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Although, it would not
be our own physical body.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It would be a manifestated
body or a manifested body.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.720 align:middle line:90%
This is very possible.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
In that concept, it is a
division of consciousness,

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
it is a division of
abilities for understanding

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and the energy that is resonant.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And place it into a body
that is also very fitting.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I see, so for you would
be more like a hologram?

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Or for us, too, it would be a
kind of a holographic image,

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.174 align:middle line:90%
projection of yourself?

01:09:36.174 --> 01:09:39.009 align:middle line:90%


01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, this is one way
to perceive it in our way

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.060 align:middle line:10%
of perceiving it.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It would not be the
full essence of who

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
you know me to be
in this moment,

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.059 align:middle line:84%
but more so just a small
portion or an avatar, perhaps

01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:54.437 align:middle line:90%
is a better way to see it.

01:09:54.437 --> 01:09:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> An avatar, I see.

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I hope someday I
get to meet your avatar,

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%
because that would be awesome.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Or even, I guess,
as Rob is having

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the conversation with you
right now, in that fashion,

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to astrally
project to your planet

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and meet you there, too.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
By any ways, I do
hope we have more

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:20.140 align:middle line:90%
conversations in the future.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%
You're very loving soul.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for everything
you're doing for humanity.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and I wish to express
to you that it is a great

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
excitement for us to communicate
and co-create in this day.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And although most
humans do not perceive

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
me to be of getting help
by talking to humans,

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.520 align:middle line:84%
as they perceive me the
one who gives all the help,

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I wish to express to you that
in our exchange of energy

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
by the questions
that you are asking

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and the parts of energy
that I have not been asked

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
by other entities
before or just the way

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
you express this,
it allows me to look

01:10:57.010 --> 01:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
into a part of my own energy
that I have not explored

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.195 align:middle line:84%
previously, which allows
me both to learn and expand

01:11:04.195 --> 01:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
at the same time you are.

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And we are very grateful
for this as well.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
We wish to express to you
that we will leave you

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.530 align:middle line:90%
this day in love and in light.

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And we will experience
each other again very soon.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, TReb.

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Good night.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Good night.

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> How did it go?

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> How was it?

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%
How was fishing?

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was great.

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
It was awesome.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:35.970 align:middle line:90%
