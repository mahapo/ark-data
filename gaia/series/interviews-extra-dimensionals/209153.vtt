there would be much
chaos this year.

It has begun, but much
more is to follow.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It is going to create challenges
for each and every individual

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
One thing that is important for
each and everyone to understand

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
is that where you put
your focus is critical.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with your Earth
moving through the universe.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You have moved into an area
where the energetic in that

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
part of the universe is an
energetic of amplification.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, where each
individual places their focus,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
there will be
amplified experiences.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So if your focus
is on fear, panic,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
as it is in much of
the world right now,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
then that fear and panic
will be exaggerated.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:10%
And you see this
already happening.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We would strongly suggest
that each individual who

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is hearing these words
makes a conscious effort

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to focus on love and compassion,
understanding, oneness, rather

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:90%
than separation.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It is of great import to
realize that each individual is

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.145 align:middle line:84%
choosing their own
path, their own reality.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It is not appropriate
to criticize the other,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
simply because that
creates separation.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
You can allow them to have
their belief, their viewpoint.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
You can allow them to
move into fear and panic

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
if that is what
they are choosing,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
for each individual, on
their path of evolution,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
has to face various things
within their own life

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:10%
As people move into the
chaos of fear and panic,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:10%
many of them have reached
a place where they say,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:10%
this cannot continue.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that place
there are many who

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
are bringing
through information,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
healing techniques, ways of
turning your energy around,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:84%
raising the vibration, coming
into the frequency of love.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
needed right now.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So for these-- for our
brothers and sisters

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
who tend to focus
on the negative,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:90%
is it just a patience?

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a waiting
game to patiently wait

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:84%
for them to shift into
a new perspective?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It is important for each
one of you to focus on your own

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
As you raise your
vibration, as you operate

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
more and more from love and
compassion, your vibration

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and your calmness will
have others saying,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:90%
why are you not upset?

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Why are you not freaking out?

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Why are you not in panic?

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there is an
opportunity to say, hey,

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:90%
because I am focusing on love.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I am meditating
every day to recenter myself.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
I am not watching the
news, reading the newspaper

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
every single moment.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I am not absorbing all of this
negativity and misinformation,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
for indeed, right
now, on your planet,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
there is vast amounts
of misinformation

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.825 align:middle line:84%
designed to focus people
on fear and panic.

00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we suggest when you
find a piece of information

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that is particularly disturbing,
rather than taking it at face

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
value, so to speak,
you take a step back,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
widen your viewpoint, and
ask, who does this benefit?

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Who is possibly wishing
for this information

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:90%
to be put out in this way?

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
For it is often that
the kernels of truth

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
are there in the
so-called misinformation.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It is simply being
blown out of proportion

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way,
designed to have

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:90%
a certain emotional response.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it is to be extra
aware of your field

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
as you take in information
and be selective about what

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.285 align:middle line:90%
you are choosing.

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So those kernels--

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because I often say,
don't throw the baby out

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
with the bathwater, so to
say, because even in these--

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But understand
that for so long,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
your various societies
have kept people limited.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:90%
This is done so easily.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a phrase--
divide and conquer.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is what is occurring
here on your Earth in so many

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Even that which you call
politics is a prime example.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>> You are being misled if you
feel you live in a democracy.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You do not.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.515 align:middle line:84%
There has never been a pure
democracy here on your Earth

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:09.315 align:middle line:90%
as yet.

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Could you go into, why now?

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Why has it taken so long, or why
aren't we waiting even longer?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:10%
What are the mechanisms that
are creating this amazing time?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, the photon belt
or the cosmic position

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, but is there
other factors involved?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed there are.

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
This is not the first
time that humanity

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
has had the opportunity to
move into the higher realms.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, unfortunately,
you collapsed back

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:90%
into the negative.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
This time, it is different.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
If you move back in
time until your 1987,

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:90%
there was a movement then.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
This movement created,
within thousands of people,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
the intention to
raise the vibration.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
This allowed, in '89,
many changes to occur.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:84%
The stargate was given
to humanity then.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Many beings discovered
healing abilities.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Many beings began to channel,
because that opening allowed

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
for the possibility of more
light, more love, and more

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
support to come of the
planet, to come to humanity.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
When the stargate was
given, it was uncertain

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
whether humanity would reach the
level needed to actually move

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:90%
into this new phase.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
In your 2012, because of the
huge number of people beginning

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to meditate, beginning
to intend a new reality,

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
you moved past the marker,
as it is often called.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You moved into a place
where the energetic for love

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is stronger than the
energetic for fear.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And like you said, it's not
necessarily numbers per se,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
but just--

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
numbers meaning one
to one, obviously,

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
because you said the
power of love is more--

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's about vibration.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Vibration.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:90%
More potent.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So in 2012, I remember on
the solstice, on the timing,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
there was, yeah, mass
meditations around the world.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I took part in one.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The shift was
being held at Agape

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:90%
down in Southern California.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And this-- it was like a big
celebration, because we all

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
knew that we had made
it to the other side,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.965 align:middle line:84%
but yet nobody
had done the work.

00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that's what
we're doing right now,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
is we're doing all this work.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Indeed, in your 2012, in
your December, was the moment--

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the tipping of the
scales energetically.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, spirit
was surprised.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
We were actually not expecting
the scales to tip so far

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
for the light, for
the consciousness,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:90%
for the awakening process.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Understand that whilst you
seem to be separate here,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
you are all connected by
the morphogenetic field

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:10%
And so what has been
happening, slowly, slowly

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:10%
since your 2012--

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:10%
and you can see it everywhere,
more and more people

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:10%
wanting that higher
consciousness,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:10%
these meditation
apps that you have,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:10%
millions joining every month.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It is becoming
"hip," so to speak.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening
now, in your 2020,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is a reckoning of sorts.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, you are doing the work.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Understand that it is also
a kind of battle for control

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that is happening, because,
beloved one, as you know,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
all of the solutions humanity
needs to change your planet,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to feed everyone, to
bring in clean energy,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to clean up your environment,
all of these problems

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are facing, the
solutions are present.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It is that they are actively
being suppressed in many cases.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a part of what
this next phase in humanity's

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:90%
evolution is about.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It is important not to judge
those who are suppressing,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:10%
to understand that we all
create our own reality.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:10%
And when their light--

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:10%
when there are enough
people intending

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:10%
to live in community,
global community,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:10%
without various layers of
separation that exist right

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:10%
now, the more you
move towards that,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:10%
the more the frequency, the
vibration on your Earth,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:10%
will allow these technologies
to come and to be

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:10%
available for everyone.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:90%
The time is coming close.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we need to say
is that these energies

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:90%
are going to shake everyone up.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It is important for each one to
recognize your limiting beliefs

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that you carry inside,
your judgments,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:90%
your limitations on all levels.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They need to be seen.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:90%
They need to be released.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It is not enough
just to meditate.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Meditate, that is
the first step.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It allows the mind to
slow down a little.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It allows clarity
to start to come.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And with that
clarity, you can start

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to see those areas
of self where you

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.925 align:middle line:84%
need to bring more light or
more truth, more honesty.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
This is necessary for
each and every one.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the inner
reconciling that is necessary.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It is as if all
of these elements

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:84%
which have existed in
the so-called "shadow,"

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the unconscious, are being
forced into people's awareness.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer able to
simply ignore and push them

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%
away for another day.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:90%
The day is now.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The tools, similar
to your global --

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the tools for your inner
transformation are all here.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:90%
And so you can seek them out.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:10%
You can use this global
chaos as an opportunity

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:10%
to resolve so much
within your own psyche,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:10%
within your own
sphere of influence.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:10%
>> And that is the focus
of the stargate experience.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:10%
We are working with individuals
to allow inner freedom

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:10%
to happen without
reliving old pains,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:10%
without reliving old
struggles, to recognize

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:10%
the programming that you have
received from your parents,

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:10%
from your schools,
from your religions,

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:10%
from your societies--

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:10%
programming which conditions
you to think and live

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:10%
in a certain way that
is not your truth.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
The stargate experience helps
bring those understandings

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
to light and then supports,
in a very gentle way,

00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
for them to be
transformed into the new,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
into the truth for
each individual.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.293 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, beloved,
truth is individual.

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to imagine,
especially right now,

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
with everything that's going on,
how we can find a place where

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
we all have different beliefs
and yet still coexist.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's happening now,
but it's quite chaotic.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense where
we're all unified in our,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I guess, acceptance
of one another.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't have to know how.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the--

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Simply focus on self.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
There are individuals
around the world who are

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:90%
going to bring in technology.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it is already here.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
There are individuals
around the world

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
who are going to start
changing the very nature

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of your politics.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
There are individuals
around the world

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
who are focusing on
regenerating your oceans,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:90%
your forests, your farms.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are available.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:10%
These individuals are
struggling right now,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:10%
but as more and more people
raise their vibration,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:10%
the frequency of the morphic
field of humanity raises.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:10%
And that raising
of the vibration

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:10%
means even those who are
holding very low frequencies,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:10%
that energy will affect them.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:10%
It will start raising
their consciousness,

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:10%
even if they don't wish it.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're on the higher
spectrum of these negative

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, would you not have
the awareness that the shift is

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
inevitable or that the
celebration, like, in 2012--

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
how come these negative
energies hang on so tight?

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it just because that's
the way they are, or?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, beloved,
yes, indeed,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:90%
they have the awareness.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:90%
But let us say this.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
You came to this Earth
to experience duality.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have duality
just with the light.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> The darkness is needed.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.980 align:middle line:84%
You have highly
intelligent people

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
connected to the light you
have highly intelligent people

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
connected to the lower
frequencies, which you

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:90%
sometimes call the dark side.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:90%
But it is all vibration.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It is just vibration.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything is vibration.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
The stargate work
is about vibration,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
bringing in higher vibration,
surrounding those who connect

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:90%
with a higher energetic.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That higher energetic starts
to vibrate you on all levels

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and to support your energies
rising effortlessly.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, the
stargate experience

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
accelerates this movement into
consciousness, into awareness,

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:90%
into self-knowing.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It is quite fascinating
to watch as individuals are

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by the
energetic of enlightenment.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
All that is not in harmony
with that enlightenment

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
in their field is actually
vibrated by a kind

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:90%
of enlightened awareness.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
That awareness shines
a very intricate web

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of knowing into the
lower frequencies.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what is starting
to occur already

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
on your Earth is those
who have impacted others

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
in a particular way, it is
not that they are suddenly

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:84%
feeling bad for how
they have impacted them.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It is that, oh, suddenly, they
have crystal clarity about how

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
they have impacted
the other, and also

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:84%
about how that has
shut them down, for it

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
shuts the individual down.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Just as harmful as it is
to others when someone

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
is holding on to that
low of frequency,

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:90%
it is actually damaging.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Allow each person to have
their individual viewpoint.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Do not argue with them.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Do not try and change them.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Focus on changing self.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And also do not think that
you know why that person has

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:90%
chosen to be that way.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:84%
You have all chosen unique
life paths for lifetimes.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
You are all on your
individual trajectory.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
There are experiences still
needed for certain individuals

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that are of a so-called
"lower" vibrational nature.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is the assistance
that will allow them

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.385 align:middle line:90%
to very rapidly grow in future.

00:25:36.385 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing to be
understood is that in order

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:84%
for your societies
to change, to evolve,

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
the old ways have to go.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what is happening on
many levels right now is,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.635 align:middle line:90%
the old is breaking down.

00:25:56.635 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, do not focus on that
focus on bringing in the new.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Focus on raising your vibration.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a greater, a larger
picture that is occurring.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:84%
There is much guidance
happening from other realms.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:84%
What is occurring
here on your Earth

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is beautiful, even though
many are suffering.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is a choice.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That is hard, perhaps,
for some to hear.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:90%
But suffering is a choice.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It is a holding on to the old.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:10%
And your conditioning
in your societies

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:10%
has told you to
hold on to the old.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And so it is very difficult
for those people who have gone

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:10%
along blindly accepting what
they have been told in schools,

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:10%
in their religions,
in the laws of .

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult, if
they have been holding on

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to those things rigidly, to
watch as they all break down,

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
because they feel totally lost.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is when those
who are holding the lines

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
can show a different way, not
by going out and preaching,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:84%
but simply by being available,
changing the vibration.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A big part of this awakening,
transformation, transition,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:84%
humanity going
through this phase,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is us reconnecting to
our galactic family.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Does Alcazar have anything
to say in regard to that?

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Beloved, we can talk for
hours on that topic should you

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.160 align:middle line:90%
wish for it.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> But let us be a little brief.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.098 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many very
advanced civilizations around

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:90%
your universe.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the skeptic
will then say,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
well, science has been
looking for a long time trying

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:90%
to find signs of life.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Why haven't they found it?

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> There are two reasons.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
One is, those benevolent
beings are waiting for humanity

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to raise their vibration.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
They are not interested
in connecting

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
with a that is still involved
in warfare, aggression,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.840 align:middle line:90%
not caring for each other.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason
is that your scientists

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:90%
are looking in the wrong place.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They are looking in
the third dimension.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
As consciousness evolves, it
affects the physical body.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:10%
The vibration rises.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It moves out of the
third dimension.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:10%
And so your science has to
look in the higher frequencies

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:10%
to find the light.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.115 align:middle line:90%
So consciousness is expanding.

00:29:16.115 --> 00:29:16.915 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:29:16.915 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Let us talk about humanity.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
As most of you accept, you have
been here for many lifetimes.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness moves
from body to body lifetime

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But we would suggest that your
consciousness was never born,

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:90%
will never die.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
It is eternal.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:10%
So if your
consciousness is eternal

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:10%
and you have only lived
maybe 100 lifetimes here

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:10%
on your Earth, where
were you before?

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:10%
You came from other
enlightened civilizations

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:10%
around the universe.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:10%
What is occurring here on
your Earth is very special.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When you came here,
part of the agreement

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
was that you would
all take similar body

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:84%
form, because where
you came from,

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%
you did not all look the same.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You came here, and
part of the agreement

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
was would forget where
you had come from.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And you knew that you would
go into deep unconsciousness

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
before you reawakened again.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:90%
That is what has occurred.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You went into the dark ages,
as you often call them, where

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness was very low.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons for that which
we won't go into right now.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But now, there have been,
for many generations,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:90%
this intention, this desire--

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't wish to
live in that way.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I wish to have more love,
more freedom, more honoring.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
bringing you, now,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to this place where humanity
is beginning to accelerate

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:90%
into higher consciousness.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
You have come from an
enlightened civilization.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
you from a civilization

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.310 align:middle line:90%
out there somewhere.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You have a star family,
as we call them,

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:84%
waiting for you to
raise your vibration,

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of
that star family.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:10%
And that star family can assist
you in this human evolution

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:10%
when you start to
connect with them.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:10%
Another aspect, just
to realize, is that you

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:10%
have been enlightened before.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you do not have
to struggle to try and find

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:90%
how to become enlightened.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Relax and remember.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
the stargate work

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
is that it is about relaxing
into the energy fields

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:90%
that we create together.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And that relaxation
allows the elevation

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
of your vibration of
your consciousness.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of
connections can then occur.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We've always been told that
we have to work hard to achieve

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:90%
the things we want.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like with
this, it's not work at all.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
being and surrendering.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:10%
>> It is about the intention
to change and the attention--

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:10%
the attention on how you
are being moment to moment.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Are you being in the
old, unconscious way,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
or are you being in a more
alert, watchful, loving way?

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:84%
When you are basking
in these energy fields,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:84%
understand that to do
is to engage the mind.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It is to engage all that
you have known, all that you

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
have cultivated in
this planetary reality,

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:90%
in this incarnation.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
These energies will gently
vibrate you beyond all

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:90%
that you have known.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is why there
is nothing to do,

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because for the humanness, it
is just about relaxing enough

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to begin to allow those
connections to come

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:90%
into your awareness.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And what can happen for
people in these rare moments

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of no mind is something
quite beautiful.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the connection
to the beyond,

00:33:53.540 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to that place of
super consciousness

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
where, quite literally,
the treasure trove

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
of experiences that are
beyond your humanness

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
start to be revealed.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.159 align:middle line:84%
They come, at first,
as a knowingness,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
a kind of sensation of opening
to something that is beyond,

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
opening to perhaps a
deeper part of self.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
That knowingness can
crystallize into adventures.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:84%
This is one big
adventure, for sure.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:84%
There are sayings of ancient
crystal skulls and energies

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.790 align:middle line:90%
held in these skulls.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about going on an
adventure to go and collect

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
these skulls, what would you
say to such an adventure,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and what is the relevance
of these skulls to humanity

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There are few of
these crystal skulls,

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:84%
as you call them, that
carry very high frequency.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They were deposited
here in ancient times.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There are many others
which are simply

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:90%
attempting to capitalize.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
They are just one of the
many forms of energetic

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:90%
that can be of support--

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:90%
for certain people.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is drawn
to those energetics.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
For those who are drawn,
then it is beautiful.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:84%
With anything,
with any energetic,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it is channeling or
healing or the crystal skulls,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
each individual
needs to tune in.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Is this right for me?

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Do I resonate with
this energetic?

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you resonate
with it, beautiful.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:90%
If you do not, beautiful.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:90%
It is for others.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Find what is resonating for
you, because all is energy.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Something else
perhaps to expand upon.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You have asked about
these crystal skulls.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:84%
This ties in with what we are
saying about how consciousness

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:90%
evolves in your universe.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
We have said they have
been deposited here.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Understand that those that are
authentic hold a beingness.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
off-planet frequencies,

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and because of this,
being in their presence

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
can start to reactivate,
trigger, again,

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that knowingness that we
speak of, for perhaps you

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
have spent time on that same
planetary civilization where

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that particular
technology is from.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the case,
it is like a lock and key.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It can start to vibrate you with
the frequencies of that planet,

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:90%
that civilization.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:90%
This can be quite beautiful.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a-- yeah, like a key
to remember our star family,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:40.685 align:middle line:90%
our star.

00:37:40.685 --> 00:37:41.485 align:middle line:90%
>> The heritage.

00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Heritage, yeah.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
During the seminar,
many people were

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:84%
having some physical
energetic reactions

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.030 align:middle line:90%
to the energy that's going on.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And you just mentioned that
there is, for some people,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:84%
a physical component to just
basking in these energies.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Could you go into
detail, or is it

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:84%
different for each
individual about what's

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:90%
happening physically?

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It is always unique
to the individual.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But we say again,
everything is just energy.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So if there is imbalance
in the body, that

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:84%
which you would call
disease or sickness,

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:90%
that too is a vibration.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Each imbalance is a vibration.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
With the stargate
energetics, if the person

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is ready and willing
to change, then

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.420 align:middle line:84%
you can simply bring
another vibration

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to that person that
cancels out, so to speak,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:90%
the imbalanced energetic.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.000 align:middle line:84%
When that is canceled
out, the physical body

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:84%
can almost instantly revert back
into or towards its perfection.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:10%
And so over the
years, many people

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:10%
have reported changes
in their physical body,

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:10%
from blindness of deafness
disappearing, from cancer

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:10%
disappearing, from the spine
which was very curved going

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:10%
straight-- all kinds
of physical changes

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:10%
just by being in
the energy field

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.680 align:middle line:10%
and having the
intention to change.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:10%
Because every imbalance
in the body is actually

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:51.270 align:middle line:10%
created by an imbalance,
a misunderstanding,

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:10%
or a programming in
your subconscious.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, it is
necessary for you

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:10%
to be willing to change
your mind, so to speak,

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:10%
in order to change the body.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, it is often in
that space of transcending

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:84%
the patterning of the mind, the
busyness, where for a moment,

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:84%
those subconscious patterns are
no longer holding the frequency

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:90%
patterns in the body.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:28.140 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer so
tightly and rigidly

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:84%
creating the same
construct that even just

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:84%
for an instant, being free from
that, the body can realign.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:90%
It is always individual.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
factors that determine

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.140 align:middle line:84%
whether and when
this can happen.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I was feeling--

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I sort of use my knee.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.740 align:middle line:84%
When energies are flowing
through me, it tenses up.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if
there's anything

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:84%
we could do to help move
the energy in the knee.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And I know it goes--

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> As we said a
few moments before,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
all imbalance in the body
has to do with an imbalance

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:90%
in subconscious programming.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:90%
The knees are about flexibility.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The knees are about
bending to authority.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.495 align:middle line:84%
The knees are about
moving forward.

00:41:22.495 --> 00:41:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:90%
So take a look.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.940 align:middle line:84%
What is it I am
resisting moving forward?

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.670 align:middle line:90%
What am I resisting doing?

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.150 align:middle line:84%
How am I feeling that
there is some authority

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.710 align:middle line:90%
figure that is controlling me?

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps this is an influence.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It isn't necessarily
something that's

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
happening in this moment in your
life, but it is from your past.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back
in that moment when

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the injury occurred,
what was happening then?

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
What was it that triggered the
knee being hurt, being damaged,

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Take a look and see.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Go back.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Understand what was
happening emotionally.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps nothing to do with
the physical activity,

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:84%
but something occurring in your
life that created the ability

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.127 align:middle line:90%
for that weakness to occur.

00:42:20.127 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a moment of
needing to move on.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there you go.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, in order to bring
balance, to being healing,

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:90%
as you would call it--

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.120 align:middle line:84%
we always use the word
balance rather than healing.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.190 align:middle line:84%
To bring it back into
balance, take a look

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and see, where is that belief
about not moving forward?

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:84%
What is the fear associated
with moving forward, being more

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:57.270 align:middle line:84%
creative, taking
more adventurous

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:84%
experiences, more risk,
it is sometimes said?

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you relate to that?

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, very much so.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So something else?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was curious.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Prageet mentioned that he had
a counterpart on a ship known

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:90%
as the commander.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
We just kind of labeled
him the commander.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.190 align:middle line:84%
We were wondering if we
might be able to connect

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:90%
with the commander at this time.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That is always possible.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So Alcazar will step aside and
the commander will join you.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:90%
The commander speaks.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:84%
We greet you on behalf
of the Galactic Command.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:03.360 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
wish for us right now?

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for
coming in this way.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Many of my conversations
over the series, the Galactic

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Command or Galactic
Federation has

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:90%
come into the subject matter.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wanting to understand
this Federation, this Command,

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:84%
in a little more detail,
and what beings make up

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
this command, and how is it
assisting humanity right now?

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The Galactic Command
consists of what you would call

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.890 align:middle line:84%
benevolent beings, beings
who are wishing to support

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.070 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of humanity.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:90%
We come together on our craft.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:45:00.160 align:middle line:84%
We have many craft in and
around your solar system,

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:84%
in and around your
very atmosphere.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Our intention is to
first of all monitor

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that which is occurring.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It is also to keep a true
record of your history,

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:23.940 align:middle line:84%
for the records kept here
on your Earth of very,

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.110 align:middle line:90%
very often biased.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:10%
Our intention is to support
the evolution of humanity

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:10%
in whichever ways humanity
allows us to support.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We have, in the past, contacted
the various governments

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.350 align:middle line:90%
around your Earth.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:90%
We have offered them technology.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We have offered them
ways of bringing

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
your societies into abundance,
your Earth back into health.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And we simply said, we
will offer you these things

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.570 align:middle line:90%
with few provisions.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Firstly, no more warfare.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, you have to care
for each and every one.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:29.100 align:middle line:84%
No great imbalance
that is occurring here.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:36.520 align:middle line:84%
These simple requests, there
was not one single government

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that said yes to this.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we now
work with individuals,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:84%
those who are
channeling, as you say,

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
those who are bringing through
energies, such as the stargate.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We work with individuals,
and those individuals share

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
information, experiences,
energies which come

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.790 align:middle line:90%
through them from the Galactic.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so unfortunately,
the potential

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:84%
for more rapid acceleration
is not possible as yet.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And because humanity chooses,
through your election

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.140 align:middle line:84%
processes, you choose those
who are ruling over you,

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:36.090 align:middle line:84%
therefore, we have to honor the
fact that you have chosen them,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and they are making
decisions on your behalf.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it is up to
humanity to change those

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:84%
who you choose to be
your representatives.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> How would you suggest--

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:57.020 align:middle line:84%
if we have a system that seems
to be so corrupt on both sides,

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:84%
because it is just a
polarity that's playing out--

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
we, individuals, best put
our energy or choose--

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:84%
what's the
alternative, so to say,

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
in maybe bypassing this
political polarity?

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> You cannot bypass it.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to change it.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And as Alcazar has said, raising
the vibration is the key.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Continuing to fight
each other, continuing

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to find ways of putting down
the other, while this continues,

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:51.460 align:middle line:84%
humanity will continue to go
into more fear, pain, struggle.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It is very simple.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It is very obvious, but
unfortunately, many people

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:05.870 align:middle line:84%
are wearing blinders
from the conditioning

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:09.650 align:middle line:90%
they have received in the past.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In our election
specifically coming up,

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.550 align:middle line:84%
we're given basically two
options in the current

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:90%
political structure.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Beloved, we would suggest
you are not given two options.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, that's what
I wanted to hear.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.415 align:middle line:84%
How do we obtain
these other options?

00:49:28.415 --> 00:49:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There are few individuals
who wish to genuinely change

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the way your political
system works.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They need to be
recognized and supported.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the way
your system has been set

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:58.710 align:middle line:84%
up right now, it is very
difficult for those individuals

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.710 align:middle line:84%
who wish to create
change to do it

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.920 align:middle line:90%
within your current structure.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, they get
marginalized, ignored.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe just to help find
those in and put our attention

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.680 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:23.500 align:middle line:84%
On board your ships,
like you said,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.580 align:middle line:84%
you have many, many
different benevolent beings.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Could you name some of
these races of beings?

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You are familiar with many
of them-- the Pleiadeans,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:40.110 align:middle line:84%
the Arcturians, the
Syrians, to name but a few.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Any reptilians-- benevolent?

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are indeed
benevolent reptilians now,

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.700 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily in your past.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:51:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Understand that with
all races, there

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:02.930 align:middle line:90%
are levels of consciousness.

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:10.770 align:middle line:84%
There are enlightened
reptilians, as you call them,

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:15.930 align:middle line:84%
although they do not
appreciate being called that.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But we will use this
human terminology.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
These enlightened
ones are actually

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:28.930 align:middle line:84%
assisting in the
transformation of humanity.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They are, in a sense, changing
the negative influences

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that their race has had
on humanity in the past,

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.920 align:middle line:84%
similarly with those
from Zeta Reticuli.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.060 align:middle line:90%
You call them the greys.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Much of my discussions,
there's talk of children

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and hybrid children from
many different races.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Are these children
on your ships at all?

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Beloved, you are all hybrids.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:12.180 align:middle line:84%
You have been on
this Earth, coming

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.310 align:middle line:84%
from these different
star families.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:19.050 align:middle line:84%
You have been mixing and
merging over generations.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You are all
multitudes of hybrids.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So we are the children.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Why would the Galactic
Federation or Command--

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.230 align:middle line:10%
why are they helping
humanity now?

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:84%
What is it what is it that
they get out of this helping?

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone, every
being, without exception,

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.145 align:middle line:90%
is on a path of self-evolution.

00:52:51.145 --> 00:52:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.560 align:middle line:84%
When you move out of
the physical realm,

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.470 align:middle line:84%
when you vibrate
into that which you

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.820 align:middle line:84%
are calling enlightenment
and beyond, then

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:90%
simply the path changes.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:84%
On your Earth, the
adults help the children.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:84%
In the greater reality,
the more advanced beings

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.580 align:middle line:84%
help those who
are less advanced.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And even though humanity
is very ego-centered,

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.640 align:middle line:84%
calling everyone
extraterrestrials,

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:34.720 align:middle line:84%
humanity is the newest
level of consciousness.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:90%
You are still in kindergarten.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But most people do
not like to hear that.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.200 align:middle line:90%
But it is the case.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>> So in a sense, us helping--

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:84%
or the Galactic Command
helping humanity

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.950 align:middle line:90%
is just part of their evolution?

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And to a certain extent, part
of our function is to protect

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.050 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the
universe from humanity--

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>> --for you are constantly
trying to put into space that

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:84%
which you call
nuclear armaments.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And although it is not very well
known, every time that occurs,

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.020 align:middle line:84%
it is our responsibility
to destroy it.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.980 align:middle line:84%
That is the way that we
are allowed to interfere.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we are not allowed
to interfere, by universal law.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:84%
We are allowed to
respond to your asking.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it is of grand
import for individuals

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to realize that you can
ask for our support.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And with your asking,
we can respond.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> On the individual level.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Which soon will be
collective, as we gather--

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It is always collective,
although you do not experience

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.960 align:middle line:90%
it as such as yet.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, beloved, we thank
you for these moments together.

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And the commander now withdraws.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:34.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:55:34.544 --> 00:55:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had a little
chat with the commander.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that was great.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not often you get
to have a conversation

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:52.750 align:middle line:84%
with a commander on a ship
from the Galactic Command.

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:53.550 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> As he said, you
simply have to ask.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's it.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Jules, I'm wondering
if you're feeling

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:07.190 align:middle line:84%
any calling for any other
energies to bring in today.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Are you--

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just wondering where
the Galactic Command--

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.770 align:middle line:90%
where did he go?

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.775 align:middle line:90%
He had to peace out really fast.

00:56:15.775 --> 00:56:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, I suppose
he had something to do.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I think he was feeling our
batteries running out, right?

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Jules, how are you feeling.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So with the unicorns,
they really come in mostly

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:90%
to deliver an energetic.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.455 align:middle line:84%
So I would invite us all
just to close our eyes.

00:56:35.455 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And even those
people watching,

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:45.560 align:middle line:84%
just close your eyes and
tune into the energy.

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The unicorns tend to bring
us into a place of deep peace

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and relaxation.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You can just simply ask for
a high vibrational energy field

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.400 align:middle line:90%
start to form around you.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.645 align:middle line:84%
And just that asking is
all it takes for the guides

00:57:05.645 --> 00:57:06.445 align:middle line:90%
to respond.

00:57:06.445 --> 00:57:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll invite the
unicorn energy to come through.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So just asking inside,
we call for the presence

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:17.090 align:middle line:90%
of the unicorns.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And just feel a gentle shift
in the field around you.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:35.648 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.648 --> 00:57:38.143 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:57:38.143 --> 00:58:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:46.315 align:middle line:84%
So you might feel the
peacefulness that they bring.

00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Playfulness.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt some playfulness.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, lovely.

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the unicorns' role?

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.690 align:middle line:90%
How come they're so--

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:08.650 align:middle line:84%
in our society and
across the world,

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:11.120 align:middle line:90%
we have this unicorn energy.

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Why is it here?

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:19.270 align:middle line:90%


00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It is rare that we speak,
and yet we speak with you,

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:28.460 align:middle line:84%
for you are one who
knows our energy.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.930 align:middle line:84%
If you look in your Renaissance
paintings, you will find us.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:35.530 align:middle line:84%
If you look in that
which is called

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:42.950 align:middle line:84%
the royal crown of your England,
if you look at your Scotland,

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:48.650 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the royal
families, the powers that

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:54.290 align:middle line:84%
were, in your past, ruling
certain civilizations,

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:57.110 align:middle line:90%
they honored us.

00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.610 align:middle line:90%
We acted as guides.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We came to deliver wisdom
at critical moments

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.020 align:middle line:90%
in your history.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And always, we guided toward
the highest potential.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:22.240 align:middle line:84%
This guidance would often bring
unexpected, lasting, benevolent

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.420 align:middle line:90%
change.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we were
seen as power creatures.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:32.470 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And what role are you
serving now in humanity?

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than
being on backpacks?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see that there
has been a resurgence.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:49.150 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We come to remind you
of the balance point.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
We come to bring you inward,
towards singularity, and not

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
your artificial
intelligence, but that

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
point within the very
center of your beingness

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.010 align:middle line:90%
where there is a wellspring.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
needed in these times.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%


01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It is not just the
unicorn realm bringing

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
this resurgence of energy, the
fae, the sprites, the dragons.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
That which you call and
label the magical realms,

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we are higher-dimensional
beings.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And humanity, directly
through your higher selves,

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
you have connections
to these realms.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
The reconnection
reminds you of a kind

01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of benevolent inner power, a
kind of playfulness, exactly--

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:07.140 align:middle line:90%


01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
a place where you can drop
some of the ego struggle.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.680 align:middle line:90%


01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance.

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It feels that's a big
part of that energy too.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:25.110 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When you recognize or realize
there's nothing to resist,

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
you can melt into a
new state of being.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
must be chosen individually.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's a reason
that your films depict us

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
in such inspired ways.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
We're reminding you
of your connections

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to a kind of
universal grandness.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we thank you
for the role that you

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:11.515 align:middle line:84%
are playing in connecting
so many sparks of energy.

01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:14.353 align:middle line:90%


01:03:14.353 --> 01:03:15.645 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all about the sparkles.

01:03:15.645 --> 01:03:18.385 align:middle line:90%


01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:19.185 align:middle line:90%
And the rainbows.

01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:23.570 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:28.720 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's rare that they--

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the most
they've ever spoken.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.320 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
To balance it out, can we
bring in a little dragon energy

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
to finish us off here today?

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:50.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:50.645 --> 01:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%


01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.850 align:middle line:10%
I am Ran of the dragon
realm and I greet thee.

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Ran.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And we wish to say to you
that these beautiful unicorns,

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
the dragon realm, and
all of the other realms

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
were known to humanity
hundreds of your years ago.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.465 align:middle line:90%
You could connect with us.

01:04:32.465 --> 01:04:34.625 align:middle line:90%
You could feel us.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You could communicate with us.

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:44.150 align:middle line:10%
That is why we are
there in your memory.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:51.680 align:middle line:10%
But then along came your
religions, saying this is evil,

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.660 align:middle line:10%
that dragons eat people.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.440 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We are here to support humanity,
as all of the other realms are.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Dragons are loving creatures.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Humanity knew that we were
loving, caring creatures

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
until, as we said,
your religions started

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to tell stories about us.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.220 align:middle line:10%
So beloved one, we withdrew.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:35.810 align:middle line:10%
We honored the fact that
we were being rejected.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:41.890 align:middle line:10%
But there have always
been few on your Earth who

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.250 align:middle line:10%
have stayed connected with us.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:51.160 align:middle line:10%
And now, more and
more are remembering,

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.500 align:middle line:10%
from their past experiences,
that they have, indeed,

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.430 align:middle line:10%
a connection with
our realm, and they

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:06.800 align:middle line:10%
are inviting us to connect
once more with them.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so for those
who hear our voice

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and can feel our vibration and
are touched by this frequency,

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
then you too are
remembering your connection

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
to the dragon realm.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And we invite you to invite
us into your meditations,

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.120 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
When we speak of dragons in
our cultures and society,

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
we have this
East/West perspective.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
In the Far East, they
have a very respectful--

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
more of a respectful-- an
honoring of this energy.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the West,
so to say, we make

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the stories of them
eating the humans

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, breathing
fire, and all of that craziness.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you do breathe fire,
but not in a malevolent way.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.850 align:middle line:90%
So could you give us--

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:19.250 align:middle line:84%
could you address
those differences?

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so different?

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Very basically, the
spirituality in that which you

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
call the East is
far more benevolent.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It does not claim
one god of all.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:47.505 align:middle line:84%
>> It does not demand
bowing down to that energy.

01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It does not demand that
you confess your sins

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.185 align:middle line:90%
to another human.

01:07:55.185 --> 01:07:57.790 align:middle line:90%


01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
more of an honoring,

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
more of an openness in
those particular societies,

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and much more of
remembering of who we are.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But also, for many
of them, still, it

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is more of a ritual
than a reality.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Many still think of it as
fairy tales, or not reality.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Not fairy tales-- dragon tales.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Dragon tales.

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.140 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.800 align:middle line:84%
That's another
story, the fairies.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:40.790 align:middle line:90%


01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back, Ron.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for that interruption.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.040 align:middle line:10%
So dragons are associated with--

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.529 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Ran.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:52.624 align:middle line:10%
Not Ron.

01:08:52.624 --> 01:08:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:56.510 align:middle line:90%
How would you spell that?

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Correctly.

01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.479 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll get it later
before I post it.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.850 align:middle line:90%


01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So my interaction with
dragons-- and I've had a few--

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
has been-- the energy I
felt was great wisdom,

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
just because the lifespan
of dragons is quite long.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering,
what is the lifespan,

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:28.399 align:middle line:84%
and what other things can
we associate-- or teachings

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.574 align:middle line:84%
can we associate
with the dragons?

01:09:30.574 --> 01:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Our lifespan is
irrelevant to you.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:44.399 align:middle line:10%
We can assist individuals to
experience the other realms

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.450 align:middle line:10%
more easily.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Many have dreams of
riding on the dragons.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Some, as they begin to
awaken, can consciously

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:05.430 align:middle line:90%
call us and travel with us.

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We share that which we
know through experiencing

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
rather than simply
teaching with words.

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:18.160 align:middle line:90%


01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The interactions
I've had have been--

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
well, I could say only
two times that I remember,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and once with a white dragon
and once with two green dragons.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance
of the colors

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.170 align:middle line:90%
of the different dragons?

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the significance
of you with the pale skin,

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:47.670 align:middle line:10%
and another with a darker skin,
and another with a very dark

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:48.540 align:middle line:10%
skin?

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.820 align:middle line:10%
What is the significance?

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Just cultural
backgrounds, histories.

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It is not so relevant.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> There are many colors.

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And beloveds, we can
change our colors.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What color are you, Ran?

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> When?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.670 align:middle line:90%
How about right now?

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What you would call
iridescent reds and blues,

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and where they combine,
beautiful purples.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:29.970 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>> We think so.

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> We all honor our beauty.

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And it will be a grand
day here on your Earth

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
when you honor your
own beauty also.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%


01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Moving forward
in our evolution,

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
what sort of permission slip
can we use to connect with

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.670 align:middle line:84%
the dragon energy, besides
the pictures of the dragons

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and things?

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:06.410 align:middle line:90%


01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You simply invite our energy.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:16.770 align:middle line:10%
There needs to be a
level of openness.

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:26.090 align:middle line:10%
There needs to be no fear, for
the old stories trigger fear.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I just remembered another
interaction I had with a dragon

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.615 align:middle line:84%
that taught me how to
overcome that fear.

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:34.670 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
The dragon showed
up in a meditation,

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and it was looking
very fearsome,

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
however, I shifted
my perspective

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
from being afraid
to being curious,

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to being in awe of the beauty
of the intricacy of the teeth

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and the scales and
just the detail.

01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
did that, it turned

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.520 align:middle line:90%
into a cartoon character.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
It turned into a loving--

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
like, that's what it
was trying to teach me.

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:18.562 align:middle line:84%
>> It is an honor to communicate
with you and through you

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:21.530 align:middle line:90%
to thousands of others.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:28.140 align:middle line:90%


01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
[COUGH]

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Whew, need some water?

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:34.900 align:middle line:90%


01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Making my eyes water.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, again, for bringing
those two lovely beings--

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
or, I'm sure, the collectives--

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
in for us.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.840 align:middle line:90%


01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.485 align:middle line:84%
>> It is simply our joy and
our love and our function.

01:13:51.485 --> 01:13:54.390 align:middle line:90%


01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Any last words for our
audience before we go?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Beloved ones, as you have
experienced a small porthole,

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
portal, into these other
dimensional realities,

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
we would suggest you do not just
stop with what you can witness

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes, with what
you can hear with your ears,

01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
but to go beyond, to
actually close the eyes,

01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to tune your listening to the
higher dimensional knowingness

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
that is within you.

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And so allow these
episodes, these sessions

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that this one, Reuben,
is guiding you through,

01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to be your openings
to the beyond.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Go beyond where you
have been before.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.820 align:middle line:10%
Allow the curiosity of the
mind not to be satisfied,

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:07.420 align:middle line:10%
but rather to drive
you further and further

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:12.310 align:middle line:10%
into your expansion,
because indeed, you are all

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:15.460 align:middle line:10%
creating your own reality.

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.490 align:middle line:90%
The shift is upon you.

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is all about
how you can navigate

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
the so-called "big waves"
that are happening now.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it is with great honoring
that we share our energies

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%
with you.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And we thank you for what
you are doing to assist.

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We are here.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.160 align:middle line:90%
We are available.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.080 align:middle line:10%
Those who will benefit from
that which we have to share

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.680 align:middle line:10%
will be attracted
to the stargate,

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.770 align:middle line:10%
and the stargate process will
accelerate their movement

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:03.250 align:middle line:10%
into higher consciousness.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for your
service to humanity.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:18.980 align:middle line:90%


01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And thank you, Jules.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for an awesome
weekend and for experiencing

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
the stargate and for bringing
through the wonderfulness--

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, this is what we do.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:36.710 align:middle line:90%
This brings us so much joy.

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to connect to
a whole new audience, that's

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:42.810 align:middle line:90%
very much appreciated.

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good fun for us.

01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for having us.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.090 align:middle line:90%
In Mount Shasta.

01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:49.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I give you guys hugs?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.
