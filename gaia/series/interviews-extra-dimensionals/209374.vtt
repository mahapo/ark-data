00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm the caretaker of
Harmony Ranch in West Sedona,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:10%
3 acres with a lot of beautiful
rescued horses and ponies

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:10%
and donkeys, a medicine wheel.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:90%
A lot of ceremony happens here.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of groups come,
have their processes,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:84%
teaching people connections,
slowing down, noticing.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The horses are great
transmitters of energy.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.490 align:middle line:84%
They are medicine
horses, is what I--

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I call the sessions
medicine horse sessions.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Sedona, the horse likes me
to say that we're a team.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So every time, I'll
give her some accolade.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
She's like Adele who helped
me get over my stuff, who

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
found me, who brings
me the people, who

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
comes out in the mud
and takes care of me.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.877 align:middle line:84%
She said, we're a team,
and you must say that.

00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So you always listen
to your horse.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Sedona.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:90%
She came with that name.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
She and I had a connection
that goes beyond this world,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:90%
this life, this dimension.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And we did some of the deepest
stuff I've ever experienced.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:90%
I had primal fear.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:10%
Whether it was another
existence, this existence,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:10%
this childhood, there's
a lot of times it might

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
have been presenting from.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And she held me up to clear it.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:10%
And horses are supposed to
feel what you feel and take

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:10%
on your emotions.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And she just was
always there for me.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:10%
And there might be days when
she lost it, and I would hurt.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:90%
We just did this together.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We climbed some kind
of spiritual ladder.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized I had
to bring the people to her too.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Sedona, the horse,
and Lyrica, instantly,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
something happened the first
time they were together.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Sedona is used to meeting people
at their vibrational frequency.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
Sedona said, oh, somebody

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
can take me into the clouds
because she's so grounded.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And they rode off together.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a while to
get Sedona back in her body

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:90%
afterward.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I just observed it.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to--

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to say a word.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.495 align:middle line:90%
I just watched.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And Gayle let Lyrica just
leaned back on her naturally.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
It was just profound.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
And Sedona loved it.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:90%
The horses loved it.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I just heard her saying
to Lyrica, why don't you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
jump on me in spirit
form and let's go?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go explore the
multiverse together

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
because I'm willing to
have a wild ride with you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and keep you safe.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:10%
Sedona had stayed out
of her body for a while.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:10%
She forgot she needed food.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to remind her
to come on back.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:90%
She was happy.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'm like, Sedona you
meant to stay on Earth.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, then you have
to reground again.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So we sent-- spent
a while getting

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.503 align:middle line:90%
her to grow her roots back.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:10%
She was having a good time
galloping through the universe,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:10%
but she had a little bit of
a job to do here in her body.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:10%
So it took a month or two
for her to fully reembody.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And it was what she
was meant to do.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:10%
It gave her new insights
about other energies

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:10%
to bring back to Earth.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So she kind of went-- we
call it up around in between,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
integrated some new
multi-dimensional energies

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
where Lyrica allowed her to go,
took her to, exposed her to.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And then Sedona embodied it.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And as she stands on the
Earth with her four feet.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
She's giving-- gifting
that back to the Earth.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think it was
wrong that it happened.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I just had to guide Sedona back.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
We say down, which is so
funny, back into her body.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
She got an experience
that she needed.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it's Sedona
is a bit older now.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And we want her to
stay here with us

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:10%
and then have her full
experience of that energy

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:10%
that Lyrica invites her to
experience at the same time.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.408 align:middle line:90%

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's talk about--

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to know from
Lyrica's perspective--

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
we heard from Adele
about her meeting,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Lyrica and Sedona, the horse.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And we recently had
a little reunion,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
which was very beautiful to
see everybody come together.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear Lyrica,
what do you have

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.335 align:middle line:90%
to say about Sedona, the horse.

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.972 align:middle line:90%
>> She is my best non-human--

00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Non-human friend in
the whole wide world.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't even need to
visit her in the physical

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
because we were so connected
in the higher dimensions.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a soul contract that
both of us got immediately.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we had much to learn
after I first took her way

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:90%
out dimensionally with me.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:90%
She loved it so much.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
She didn't come back
in for quite some time.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a problem for Adele and
Sedona's role as a medicine

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:90%
paint therapist for children.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have
dimensional boundaries

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:90%
that we have to honor.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is still plenty
of higher light room

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
for us to share our
heart in this world.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Hearts are the most important
asset to honor and bless.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Sedona does that often for me.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I was worn out
from this morning session

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and bolted out the
door to say done.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But Sedona nuzzled up
to me and filled me

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
with such love and support,
but now I'm OK to proceed.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't even put
into words what she

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
means to me as a teacher
and a guide who's

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
not compromised in any way.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
She is just here to
clearly love and serve.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what animals
and nature bring to us.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
life complications

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that we seem to create and
then have to reorder as part

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of our waking up process.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Sedona is already awake.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't need my help.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But my love is greatly honored
and appreciated by her.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> When she said compromised,
does that mean kind of being

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body
in this plane people,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
teachers even can
get compromised?

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> People, even teachers
get compromised.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It happens when the
light truth we are

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
drops into our
pockets of untruth,

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
where our darkness
still remains waiting

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to be addressed and transmuted
into its light of day.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Horses act on instinct.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's a truth position,
just like intuition

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
is our truth position.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't judge
our poor behaviors

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.035 align:middle line:84%
when we treat them in
unkind or thoughtless ways.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:33.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Ways.

00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Where humans can--

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
we get a little
caught up in the ego.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.805 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Lyrica, I noticed how
absolutely calm you are.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that Sedona's
presence that is really

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
coming in and
bringing you peace?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sedona.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.685 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you.

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:05.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally, when
did you meet Sedona?

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.276 align:middle line:90%
>> When we moved here in 2014.

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so around the time
I was talking to you guys.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:90%
That's-- through Adele.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.585 align:middle line:84%
And all of her family of
skulls, all of that kind of

00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:18.385 align:middle line:90%
came in together.

00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> With the skulls.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of the skull,
I'd like to segue

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:90%
into that a little bit.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
When Lyrica talks to the
Mitchell Hedges' skull,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is the skull have a more of a
feminine energy or a masculine

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.974 align:middle line:90%
or is it balanced?

00:08:34.974 --> 00:08:38.079 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it is
by design balanced.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think each person
who relates to it

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
does so from their own
state of development

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
within their own balancing
act of their feminine

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and masculine.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
In our new book, we
have a big chapter

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
on balancing both the feminine
and masculine as our journey

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I love that part because
in my ascension journey,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I travel through different
developments or steps.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
First, came
experiencing oneness,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
then exploring oneness,
and then the next hip hop

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
would naturally be to
stabilize being in oneness.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's not possible
without balancing the feminine

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and masculine because they
need to operate as one wholly

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:90%
tag team.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, I get my intuitive
guidance and wholly full of

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
energy from the feminine
side of my nature.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to bring it
forward, to take a step,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
or act in a world
in a certain way

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to manifest a higher outcome
requires my balanced masculine

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to partner with the
feminine light in me.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So manifestation in
this world begins

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
in the inspiration and
direction of the feminine,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.685 align:middle line:84%
but landing it into a physical
outcome is a masculine role.

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So kind of like Sedona, I
don't see the skull having

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:90%
any mistaken orientation.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
It feels very pure, but it
can be used in impure ways

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:90%
by unfair tapper-inners.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Tapper-inners.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That's a funny
word, tapper-inners.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Like tampering?

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.267 align:middle line:84%
Tapper-inner, like people that
are tapping into the skull.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.657 align:middle line:84%
They could try to use
it for the wrong--

00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's powerful, they
could try to use that power.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.907 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that
masculine is unbalanced.

00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to use
it for self rather than

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
for the good of
all or for a higher

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
good or truth kind of outcome.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you were saying?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Has it been used
that way before?

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I remember having a dream.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Lyrica's dad is-- we
were talking about it

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:10%
in another session,
was Yaqui, Mayan kind

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:10%
of Civil rights person.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:10%
But I can remember, I
guess, certainly a past life

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:10%
when he was probably like I was,
involved with protecting it.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was definitely a race
to save the skull from getting

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:90%
into the wrong hands.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
the details.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But the essence of
that intensity--

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the intensity of
that guardianship

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and doing whatever
it took to keep it

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
in the right hands and
not the wrong hands

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
was very, very strong and
palatable to me at the time.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many dark forces
still on the planet now that

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:90%
we're purging.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, Bill has an important
role to keep that from--

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at least he has the
martial arts ability so that

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
if there was some kind
of hijacking effort,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that he would have the
ability to protect her/him.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We've seen him swat some
hands that tried to touch it

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:90%
without permission.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:90%
So that was quick.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Look how much he invited
and encouraged Lyrica to just

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
almost fondle the skull.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was very, very--

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect that.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.435 align:middle line:90%
And I was very touched by it.

00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've seen him only
really allow some of the Mayan

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:90%
elders or--

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the people he allows to touch
it are the people that you

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
can tell have a high spiritual
awareness and centeredness.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't let just any
random people touch it.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in some sessions,
I think he feels

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
or the skull will tell him
it's OK for them to touch it.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate Lyrica-- you
and Lyrica's time for helping us

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%
understand the journey better.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So just want to
acknowledge the connection

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and acknowledge the guidance.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I think Bill is, for
sure, on a journey

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:90%
that we've been documenting.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's processing a lot,
especially these days.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the time
he's spent is helping

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:90%
with processing that energy.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In our belief system,
this source energy,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
the source light, the source
signature is also the signature

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:90%
of the divine mother.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's very apparent
to us that that's

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
a really lost leader
in society right now

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
through all the generations
of persecution and abuse

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And the divine
masculine really can't

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
come in to its balance and truth
without the divine feminine

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
being re-installed literally
on the Earth plane.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole idea
of having this stack

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of this wonderful
group of the non-verbal

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.592 align:middle line:84%
autistics who are innately
naturally connected

00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:90%
with the light of the mother.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's their signature.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%
That's who they are.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually hold
and access it and bring it

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.465 align:middle line:90%
into the pyramid portal.

00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other-- that's

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
a whole big story
about the pyramid.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.397 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we want to
go into that or not but--

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, actually,
I do eventually.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
This might be a
good segue for that.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> [SINGING] This
is very precious.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:90%
This is very precious.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I like the way your eyes
shine bright on this very day.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:90%
All right, all right.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, let mom start
talking about this.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to talk a little bit
about this amazing beloved

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:10%
pyramid in our life.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It was built by two very highly
conscious Sedona engineers,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.996 align:middle line:90%
Jason Stiles and Michael Massey.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it began--

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:10%
was it 2015?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was, when
I met Gayle and Lyrica.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.925 align:middle line:90%
And we had an instant rapport.

00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we had spent
some time together.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And we had gone on a big
mission, if you will.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a cool experience for
Gayle, Lyrica, and myself.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%
And we went 1,200 miles.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And we did a trip all the way
around the four corners hitting

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:90%
up all these sacred sites.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And we were gathering
what I called magic sand

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
from all these vortex locations
at national parks through

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
there in Arizona, then into
Utah to Zion and Arches National

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Park, and then on into
Colorado to Garden of the Gods,

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and then down through
Taos in New Mexico,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:90%
and then back to Sedona.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we-- what I
did is I looked for--

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
at each of these
locations, I was

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
looking for-- there's
a very fine powdery

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
almost like a powdered
sugar type of sand

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
that's typically found
around vortex sites.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I was looking
for that sand.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually collected
this sand all around the area.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually used that
as one of the building materials

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that went into the very first
pyramid that we made together.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're familiar with
organic builds where you're

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
using a variety of different
layered materials encased

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
in resin?

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we're
actually then also coupling that

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
with a core quartz crystal that
is wire wrapped and then also

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
with an-- what we
call active pyramid.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So we build this pyramid
that's actually is a--

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:90%
actually build this capstone.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And that capstone
has a core crystal

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that is actually
surrounded by a wire coil

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
that we run a current through.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:90%
That generates a magnetic field.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
the frequency, it's

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
going to change the
field characteristics

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what the field
is-- the magnetic field that's

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
generated.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Then it can have a different
pulsed frequency to it.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And then depending on
which frequency you select,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
then you may feel
different effects

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and would target
different chakras

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
within the chakra system
or different organs

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
within the body,
different systems.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
with Gayle and Lyrica,

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I originally just set
up the first pyramid

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that the frequency
that's generating

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
was set in phase
with a light, show--

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
we actually put lights
in the thing as well.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So that it was
actually matching--

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the frequency was
matching or in phase

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
with whether blue,
green, red, purple,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:90%
with the color spectrum.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And so it was an alternating.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:90%
That's how we did--

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I built the first
pyramid for them.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
pyramid, they only

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
used actually the
frequency inputs

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:84%
for a short period of
time before they actually

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
unplugged those, feeling that
actually that programming was

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:90%
complete.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
were able to just layer

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:84%
on additional programming
into the device.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a specific
or unique frequency.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
the resonant frequency

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
of the specific coil system that
generates the magnetic field.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to be
in the ultrasound range.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's up around 28
kilohertz, above the spectrum

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of human hearing.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So you needed to use a special
ultrasound frequency generator.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is we're familiar

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
with harmonic resonance or
resonant frequencies of what's

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
called a natural frequency.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:10%
A classic example
is a opera singer

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:10%
who sings that they
hit-- if they're

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:10%
able to hit the natural
frequency of a crystal goblet,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:10%
it starts to oscillate.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:10%
And it can oscillate
with continued input.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.097 align:middle line:10%
It keeps amplifying,
amplifying, amplifying

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:10%
until it will actually
shatter, right?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.165 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what happens
with the natural frequency.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We also see the same thing
or experience the same thing

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a singing bowl if--

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
or playing the
water goblets when

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you're able to hit the
right frequency, then all

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden, it starts to hum.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually a
specific natural frequency

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for the coil, the
magnetic coil that

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
happen-- that is in
that ultrasound range.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
And when that frequency is hit--

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
so even though it's a 28
kilohertz input signal,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:84%
it produces about
a 60 hertz output

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
where it actually
beats like a heart.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It goes boom, boom, boom.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The very first pyramid, it was
built, and I included a device.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It was called a star
catcher is what I called it.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a secondary
coil system that

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:90%
set underneath kind of in the--

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
like a disk in the
middle of the pyramid.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
most of the pyramid

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
builds that were
kind of going on,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it was starting to-- a few
guys were doing this in Sedona.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And their main focus was to kind
of harness their consciousness

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and then use the pyramid to
amplify it to use so-called--

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:90%
get out.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Astral travel.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral travel to
escape this world, right?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Did it work?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And it does kind of
work in that regard.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
That's one way that you
can utilize the technology.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.972 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that was really

00:21:20.972 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
interesting about Lyrica,
as a non-verbal autistics,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:90%
she's already out there.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:90%
She's trying to get in here.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying to get into
a body that she has like--

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I liken it to--

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
it's imagine you have
a puppet, and you're

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:90%
trying to control a puppet.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you only
had like three strings.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And so you can move one arm
and a leg and the torso.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:90%
That's about all.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So she had very few strings at
which her overall consciousness

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
could manipulate her physical
body and leaning to-- this

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:90%
is the non-verbal autism.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And so her interest
was actually to come--

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is how to get
deeper into her body

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:90%
to be able to command it more.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And through-- so we built this
to actually bring energy down

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and anchor it.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And as it turn-- it
ends up turning out,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid did serve a
purpose in helping Lyrica

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:90%
to ground deeper into her body.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she-- some of the
things that she's able to do--

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know that--

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
if Gayle had shared
some of it with you.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But that-- is she'll get into
the fridge herself right now.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
She can open up things that
she couldn't have before.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
She can feed herself in ways
that she couldn't ever before.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Is really amazing,
and it's working.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So now, I liken
it to-- obviously,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
she's not-- she isn't
fully functional.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.785 align:middle line:84%
But it's like she went from
three strings to, let's say,

00:23:01.785 --> 00:23:02.585 align:middle line:90%
two dozen.

00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:03.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Which has given her--

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
it's expanded her own ability
to interact with her environment

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in very incredible ways.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So there was that
kind of function.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was another
function that was kind of--

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:84%
this was kind of a
telepathic conversation

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that I was having with
Lyrica that we didn't really

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
loop Gayle in too much because
it was somewhat of a kind of--

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
call it a surprise.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that this pyramid build
was really was for Gayle.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You see, prior to--
in like 10 years ago,

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
you had Gayle acting as somewhat
of a translator or interpreter.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And Lyrica was the
one that was having

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:90%
this galactic cosmic experience.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.492 align:middle line:90%
And then Gayle was just was-

00:24:05.492 --> 00:24:06.292 align:middle line:90%
>> The translator.

00:24:06.292 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> The translator.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And so there was a--

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Lyrica really
wanted her mom to be

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
able to share with her some of
these other planes of existence

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to travel
with her through the ethers.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this pyramid build,
particularly this second build

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.534 align:middle line:90%
is like a--

00:24:31.534 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:90%
it's a harness.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a container.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a spaceship
that allows Gayle

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share these
experiences with Lyrica.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.002 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:24:45.002 --> 00:24:46.325 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:24:46.325 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We waited till we built
and delivered the second one.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was in--

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that was in the summer
of 2016, I think.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when we
completed that build.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.365 align:middle line:84%
And that one's kind of one of
a kind, what we call an arc 2.

00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:90%
So we had delivered that.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was more like
let's wait and see.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And rather than trying to set
the expectation of oh, hey,

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:90%
this is for you and--

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:90%
then it was just--

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:90%
it was just a wait-and-see.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was about--

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it was maybe
about a year later

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
where the reports
just kept coming in.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And so Gayle was sharing with
her all these experiences

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
that she's having.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, it
was like, OK, well, now

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you-- now it's time to
reveal this is for you.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When this was being built,
Lyrica and Michael were working

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
together in the
higher dimensions.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And they realized over time
that they were actually

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:90%
building a 12D template.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we were
guided to actually take

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
this, their template and drive
a four-state area from Arizona

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to Utah to Colorado
to New Mexico

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and actually deposit it
in the grid to support

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:90%
humanity's ascension process.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So when this structure
was being built,

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Michael was very conscious
about embedding that 12D portal

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
into the actual design
of this pyramid.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
He also has a very close
telepathic relationship

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
with Lyrica.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So when he-- when this
thing was being built,

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Lyrica would
downstream or send him

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
telepathic messages about
more spiritual technology that

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
was coming through
her soul stream

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that needed to go
into this pyramid.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So all the time, there were
higher beings involved.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But there was also this
download from Lyrica going

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:90%
through Michael into the build.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the beginning of
that consciousness factor

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that was being co-created.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So with Lyrica, so it
begins with an open-hearted

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:90%
invitation.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So we just sit together, open
our hearts to each other.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind of
have this protocol

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
where what we're going to do is
we're going to do like a mind--

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like a mind meld
or entering a drift.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And so then-- so our
consciousness come together.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to start rolling

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:90%
through different thoughts.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just-- and I
hold each thought for just

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:90%
like a second, if that.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'll be-- do
is I just allow my mind

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to think whatever thoughts might
be coming up into the queue.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is then Lyrica

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:84%
has a feedback mechanism when I
hit a thought that she really,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
really likes, then she'll do--

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
she has a-

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Physical.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Physical signature
of a yes that we have.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.948 align:middle line:84%
And if it's something
that she really loves,

00:28:09.948 --> 00:28:10.865 align:middle line:90%
then she just giggles.

00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's-- yeah, that
feedback is important, yeah.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:10%
I still work a little
bit here and there

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:10%
with Jason at IPyramids.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:10%
We have in our mind
actually another Bill

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:10%
to make at some point.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
In the not too distant future,
we're going to go for--

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
would be a-- what
we call an arc 12.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.856 align:middle line:90%
It would have 12--

00:28:37.856 --> 00:28:38.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:28:38.656 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> 12 field generators in it.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It would actually be what we
call the vector equilibrium.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, yeah, yeah.

00:28:44.912 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> If you're familiar with that.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Very familiar.

00:28:46.505 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not been done.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the most we've
done is an octahedron.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:51.136 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we had
built one of those.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And we first debuted it
at the pyramid conference

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:90%
up in Chicago.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:10%
This was back in 2016.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.117 align:middle line:10%
And we set that up,
created the space,

00:29:06.117 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:10%
and we had a line all the way
down the hallway of people

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:10%
coming in to take three-minute
rides inside of it.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
feedback people

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.842 align:middle line:84%
were getting when
they were coming out

00:29:14.842 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
was just tears streaming
down their face.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We also-- when we
first set that device up,

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
took us 17 hours
to put it together.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we finished it, then
we noticed the TV turned itself

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:90%
on, that we had in the room.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:90%
We thought, wow, that's unusual.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.534 align:middle line:84%
What was really unusual, is that
it was unplugged from the wall.

00:29:35.534 --> 00:29:36.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So well, there's been all
kinds of anomalies around this

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:90%
particular device, and so--

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but the biggest one
we've built is this--

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:90%
the-- yeah--

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.933 align:middle line:84%
The 6, yeah, the arc 6,
which is in octahedron shape.

00:29:50.933 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to build
an arc 12, which would

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:90%
be in a vector equilibrium.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Or in Jason's words, if I
can remember them, this is a--

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:10%
let's see-- a biofield
generator that re-patterns

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:10%
or reorient the holographic
multi-dimensional informational

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:10%
field of the mind-body complex
using golden ratio optimization

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.350 align:middle line:10%
and superluminal
pulsed electromagnetic.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:10%
So chew on that
one for a minute.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Good memory, though.

00:30:25.425 --> 00:30:28.095 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my big revelations in
meeting you guys was that there

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is this collective
that there's--

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and America is part
of this collective.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.753 align:middle line:84%
And so many people,
I think, don't--

00:30:45.753 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't even
crossed their mind.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to show and talk

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
about just a little bit
is that collective--

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
autistic collective
consciousness

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that is coming here
in helping humanity

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.476 align:middle line:90%
raise its consciousness.

00:31:01.476 --> 00:31:04.651 align:middle line:90%
>> It is still--

00:31:04.651 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It still is a higher
light than most can directly

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:90%
interface with or receive.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there are teachers
who help translate

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
this frequency for
families and others

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
who desire to
experience who we are

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and the gifts we have to share.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
My connection with the autism
collective consciousness

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that I like to call the
non-verbal autistic higher

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
light purpose has been a very
important part of my journey.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I would not be who
I am or where I

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
am without the
presence and power

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:84%
the non-verbal
autistic collective.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
At times, I have shared my
telepathic conversations

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:90%
with beloveds in my soul group.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.660 align:middle line:90%
And other times, not so much.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Yet, when things
get hard in my life,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:84%
I tap into the non-verbal
autistic higher light

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:90%
purpose as my guiding light.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I just have to look
over my shoulder

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and see and feel the sea of
massive heart love essence

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that my beloveds
hold and represent.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It helps me get back up and
return to my purpose, which

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
is to shine the light
as I am and they

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.598 align:middle line:90%
are to humanity at large.

00:32:15.598 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a collective
agreement by the individuals

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:84%
but this greater consciousness
to come here in this planet,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.605 align:middle line:90%
is my understanding?

00:32:24.605 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> My experience.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Is that I was personally
chosen to play a unique role

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:90%
in our ascension process.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I said a loud yes.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Others in my soul group received
a similar tap on the shoulder

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:84%
to come in as masters of
higher light consciousness

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:90%
to support planetary evolution.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:84%
This soul choice made by a
vast number of my beloveds

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is key to fulfilling the
non-verbal autistics higher

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:84%
light purpose right
here and right now.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Our design is lightly
incarnated souls

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
who have not lost their
connection to source

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is the secret to our ability to
support humanity's ascension.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We do so by bringing
our high vibe

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.807 align:middle line:84%
frequency into families
and communities

00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:11.765 align:middle line:90%
where we live and play.

00:33:11.765 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
This frequency touches others
in a very different ways.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Some, who are already in their
own higher light patterning,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
reach out to us as ambassadors
of great light transport.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet others, who
are less involved,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:90%
see us as problems and misfits.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Yet, we don't give up.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.848 align:middle line:84%
However, we can only
be true to what we are.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We are mom likes to call
energy meter readers.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In our environments, we
mirror the energetic pattern

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of coherence or
lack of coherence

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:90%
in each and every moment.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we act out, it's not
because we're misbehaving.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Is because we're responding
to a terrible energy dream

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.145 align:middle line:84%
that we hope someone will
notice and learn from.

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that means change
too if they can, right?

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:90%
I love my newer--

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I love my newer ability to
use spoken words here and there

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.370 align:middle line:90%
with mom.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.636 align:middle line:84%
One of my faves
is cut or cut now.

00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Cut.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, wait a minute,
what did you say?

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:26.884 align:middle line:10%
>> Contact.

00:34:26.884 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe that's what she said.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.715 align:middle line:10%
>> Contact.

00:34:28.715 --> 00:34:29.445 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, contact.

00:34:29.445 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Making contact.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.399 align:middle line:10%
>> You make contact?

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That's when my wise mom
knows that I'm responding

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
to something in our immediate
time of interaction that is out

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:90%
of alignment.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:90%
She gets it quickly.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:90%
And the job is done.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But many families,
that's not the case.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
So a struggle follows when
they try to fix us, making us

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:90%
into little people robots.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not our role.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
We strongly refuse
to be programmed

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.450 align:middle line:84%
into anything that is out
of alignment with our truth.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to
change to please others,

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:84%
it would shut down our higher
abilities and self purpose

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:04.835 align:middle line:90%
for being here.

00:35:04.835 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Just-- we touched upon
Adrian and Daniel.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And how does Lyrica
work with them

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
as the collective and the
role-- what they were working on

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
back then and maybe
if they're still

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.002 align:middle line:90%
working together now astrally.

00:35:20.002 --> 00:35:20.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Even--

00:35:20.802 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Even when I dropped out
of my active role with them,

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.595 align:middle line:90%
my heart never forgot.

00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> My heart never forgot.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:84%
They are-- I'm going
to start crying.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:90%
They are so dear--

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They are so dear
to me and to mom.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They are teachers of
mine in many ways.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And our family retreats
together in our home in Sedona.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
We had such terrific light
journeys shared together.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
When we were no longer in
the same physical space,

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
both had their
ways of popping in.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to their
telepathic taps

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:84%
into my day or even a sensation
of their light hitting mine.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Instantly.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.225 align:middle line:84%
I read whose signature it
is and smile for the visit.

00:36:03.225 --> 00:36:04.025 align:middle line:90%
>> For the visit.

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.730 align:middle line:90%
They pop--

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> They pop in when
I need some support.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And I believe they understand
my life almost as well as I do.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.940 align:middle line:10%
>> As well as I do.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.025 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:17.825 align:middle line:90%
When Adri--

00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When Adri wanted to make her
presence known to mom without

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.130 align:middle line:84%
using telepathy, she would turn
on my iPad and make it play

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the song mom calls
her Adri song.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Calls her Adri song
"You'll be in My Life,"

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.605 align:middle line:90%
by Phil Collins.

00:36:33.605 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It just makes me tear up.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.300 align:middle line:84%
"You'll be in My Heart,"
that's what it is, yeah.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
So she--

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So Adri is a
master of telekinesis.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Telekinesis, of being able
to turn things on that are not

00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:50.125 align:middle line:90%
turned on.

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:50.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:36:50.925 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And Daniel has even--

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Daniel has an equally
remarkable higher ability

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:90%
called shapeshifting.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
He has appeared to mom
twice here in Sedona

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:90%
as a multi-colored lizard.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I love how mom instantly
knew it was Daniel.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.100 align:middle line:84%
She was able to get very close
to this Daniel lizard whose

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
bodily markings resembled
a Matisse-like modern art

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.370 align:middle line:90%
painting.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Modern art painting.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This lizard animated by
Daniel's consciousness remained

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
very still just looking up
at mom until its message

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and energetic gift to
her have been delivered.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
These appearances happened at
Ari in Crescent Moon Ranch.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They're sacred places where
our families loved to visit.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so those are some of
the wonderful memories that we

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.962 align:middle line:84%
And there is one
more holy story--

00:37:49.962 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There's one more holy
story to share about Daniel.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:10%
We began first meeting with both
families in their own homes.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:10%
Daniel lives in San Antonio.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:10%
On the last day of our
first visit together,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:10%
mom was working with Daniel
with his mom's permission

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:10%
since Daniel was a new typer.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Mom's expertise and
total faith in Daniel

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
was supporting him to believe
in his own innate ability

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.946 align:middle line:90%
to type his truth.

00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember those days, yeah.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.031 align:middle line:90%
>> He looked--

00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> He looked at me.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And mom knew his
message was for me.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:34.945 align:middle line:84%
He slowly typed out you are my
sweetheart forever and ever.

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And ever.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And all-- mom and his
two parents cried-

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> To think we have the capacity
and heart to love in this deep

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:90%
eternal way.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're here-- there's
no question that their whole

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:84%
purpose for being here in the
form they are is to support

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:90%
our ascension process.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We just have to give them
sort of a vehicle and enough

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
honoring and
understanding of them

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.180 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
really be who they are.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:90%
And they've had a rough go.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're also hoping
that the physicalization

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid and the
dimensional corridor being more

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
physicalized will give
them a kind of a safe haven

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to sort of recharge
and really step more

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
firmly and consciously into the
purpose that they're here for.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, obviously,
because of COVID and the idea

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of vaccinations is
such a hot topic.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we back up a few
years before we even

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
got into the vaccination
topic of COVID,

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
talk about vaccinations

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
having an effect on the
numbers of autistic people

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was wondering from--

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:84%
there's the physical
chemical reactions going on.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's a
higher perspective as well.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
How do we balance
that idea of this

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:84%
is caused from a chemical
injection as well--

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and then the actual idea of an
energetic collective conscious

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%
plan to come in at this time?

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:84%
How does that work
together like that?

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.617 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a wonderful
whopper question.

00:40:45.617 --> 00:40:46.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Lyrica?

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.204 align:middle line:84%
Put all your
philosopher hat, OK?

00:40:51.204 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I agree--

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I agree that
vaccines, all of them,

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
are toxic to higher
vibratory beings.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And we protests that whole
mindset of forcing humans

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:90%
into programmed Earth agendas.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:84%
For sure, we chose
a very tough role

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to play as masters here
without a speaking voice.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
See, once we fell
into Earth's density,

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:84%
we immediately experienced
many frequency challenges

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to our biology, the most
notable being the vaccines.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I believe that
the sole choice

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:84%
takes precedence at all
times, and everything else

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:90%
is secondary.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:84%
This truth is clearly
illustrated in our new book.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I have an illness that
no one could figure out.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.421 align:middle line:84%
It was labeled as
failure to thrive.

00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:46.546 align:middle line:84%
And it was placed in hospice
care expecting to die.

00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I was in hospice to die.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And the end of the story
obviously is I didn't die.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, I didn't know that.

00:41:58.815 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It-- she had three
near-death experiences, yeah.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.140 align:middle line:84%
One before this book,
and two in the book.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but I learned--

00:42:09.255 --> 00:42:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I learned it was not
a medical causation.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a soul choice, one that
I did not consciously make,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
but my soul did, because I
had to have a light filled

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
experience of being
in my body, which

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.730 align:middle line:84%
often happens prior
to death in order

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.965 align:middle line:90%
to choose to fully embody.

00:42:25.965 --> 00:42:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess what she's saying
is that choice is primal.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it kind of guides
the whole process, then how

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.985 align:middle line:90%
the biology follows in its--

00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I guess in its
development of becoming

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.105 align:middle line:90%
the human that's intended.

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:51.905 --> 00:42:55.206 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a whole other--

00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:57.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Mechanism that's really--

00:42:57.022 --> 00:42:57.855 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand,

00:42:57.855 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to
understand, yeah.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But ultimately-- yeah,
that was kind of my question.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I kind of
knew the answer

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:90%
from all the work we're doing.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to hear
from Lyrica that, yeah,

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.265 align:middle line:90%
the soul seems to be--

00:43:09.265 --> 00:43:10.065 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:11.565 align:middle line:90%
>> The soul--

00:43:11.565 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul is guiding

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> The soul guides everything.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Most people forget that.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, the soul knows when
to come in and when to leave.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
In my ascension journey,
I had experiences

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that tap into the soul's travel
in and travel out mechanism

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:90%
that I know as soul bubbles.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:84%
In my travels to my spaceship
and connecting from their back

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.210 align:middle line:84%
into our pyramid here, I
experienced this dynamic

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
as the transporting of
some of my soul bubbles

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:90%
out and then back in.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a totally
different idea

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of what people
think of as death.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it as
death, but instead

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful transference
back into our heavenly home

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and can naturally
happen in softer ways

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:03.260 align:middle line:84%
when it lights up a life
completion celebration.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The-- after my
hospice recovery, I

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
knew I wanted to
leave this world

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in an able-bodied, soul-chosen,
and soul-directed way.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Just stay tuned.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Stay tuned.

00:44:16.615 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of the idea
of death and ghosts,

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:29.650 align:middle line:84%
we have physical
anomalies of other beings,

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:34.740 align:middle line:84%
many traumatized beings from
wars and battles and even

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.300 align:middle line:90%
the Holocaust.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.810 align:middle line:84%
What's her perspective on
those particular souls that

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:90%
are, in a sense, trapped here?

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- how do we--

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.195 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't work in--

00:44:48.195 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't work in this realm,
but I know there are very

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
wonderful people who can
bring closure to trapped souls

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.400 align:middle line:84%
by resolving issues that
were not closed at the time

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:90%
of their exit.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.924 align:middle line:90%
>> At the time of exit.

00:45:00.924 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And then transitioning
into sort of Native American

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and Indigenous
teachings, we have--

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.440 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like much
of what they say--

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and I know Lyrica actually
has a Mayan dad, and--

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:90%
so she has that blood in her.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And many of the things that
she says sort of that has--

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:84%
being around-- going
up to Hopi and being

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:84%
around many of the
Indigenous teachings,

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they have this idea
just leave it to spirit.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:90%
The spirit will take care of it.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like letting the
universe do its thing, right?

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it's connecting
with the animal kingdom

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.290 align:middle line:90%
as well in that sense.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
There's more of a connection in
their culture to these energies

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.720 align:middle line:90%
that I've known.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds--

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it when
she's talking.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it brings
me back to those

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:84%
teachings that I've learned from
being around those energies.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So could she say something
about her ancestry

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.361 align:middle line:84%
and the Indigenous
peoples of the planet?

00:46:14.361 --> 00:46:18.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The Indigenous ones past
and present know that a deep

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:10%
connection to nature is
the only true road to walk.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:10%
Humans have injured
our precious Mama Gaia

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:10%
by their lower
consciousness ways

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:10%
of caring only for themselves.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a long way to go
to correct that injustice.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Yet, even a longer
road to understand

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
how our connection
to the Earth, nature,

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.900 align:middle line:84%
her cycles, and her life
force is the only medicine

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and healing that truly matters.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about moving
into our hearts,

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
into a space to honor every
living aspect of creator

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.390 align:middle line:84%
as our family here for us
to care for and learn from.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.600 align:middle line:10%
When we remember this
Indigenous way of nature, living

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.265 align:middle line:10%
and walking, we are on the
path of creating the new Earth.

00:47:04.265 --> 00:47:08.558 align:middle line:84%
>> On the path of
creating the new Earth.

00:47:08.558 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the path we are--

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:18.371 align:middle line:84%
many of us are failing these
days to get back on that path.

00:47:18.371 --> 00:47:22.705 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, how beautiful
is just to go hug a tree?

00:47:22.705 --> 00:47:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> To hug a tree, to
have that communication.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming back.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.760 align:middle line:90%
I feel a lot of people--

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.210 align:middle line:84%
especially since we started
this journey 10 years ago,

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.530 align:middle line:84%
so many people are coming
to that realization.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I started my journey 10
years ago or a little

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:90%
over 10 years ago.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But along my path,
I'm seeing around me,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.940 align:middle line:84%
wow, look at all
these people who--

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.770 align:middle line:84%
many who were already on the
path that I've connected with,

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:58.270 align:middle line:84%
but many more who also have
decided to embrace those

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's for us--

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a big part of the column
but the return to Sedona.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.980 align:middle line:90%
There's just such magic here.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.827 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just--

00:48:06.827 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Red Rocks
are just killer.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day, I get up
and drive to the grocery store.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And even if there's
kind of traffic

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go
like, a whole hum.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:15.865 align:middle line:90%
It's like I don't care because--

00:48:15.865 --> 00:48:17.615 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got the best
view in the planet.

00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the best medicine
in the whole wide world that I

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.660 align:middle line:84%
could be immersed in, whether
it's a slow trip or a fast trip

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:30.700 align:middle line:90%
but it's not just the Red Rocks.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the history of
the Indigenous ones

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that put this
territory on the map

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and created the
sacredness of the grid.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.360 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really
heartwarming to me

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can do a lot
of damage and mischief,

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:56.342 align:middle line:84%
but that core strength kind
of remains in spite of us.

00:48:56.342 --> 00:48:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
a lot of people here now

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that are working with the grids
and working with the Indigenous

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.960 align:middle line:90%
practices and teaches--

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.920 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And what I love about it was--

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.200 align:middle line:84%
it's my understanding that
originally the Indigenous ones

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't even live in Sedona.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
They lived outside of
Sedona because they only

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.818 align:middle line:90%
came here for ceremony.

00:49:15.818 --> 00:49:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yep, I've heard
that too recently.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.048 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that
until recently.

00:49:19.048 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was--

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.830 align:middle line:84%
part of that was just
out of respect and also

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:31.600 align:middle line:84%
knowing the level of energy
that this place generates day in

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.065 align:middle line:84%
and day out, and
respecting that as well.

00:49:35.065 --> 00:49:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The non-verbal autistics and
Lyrica and where we're headed

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:51.550 align:middle line:84%
with all of this, can you tell
us a little bit about your role

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.968 align:middle line:90%
in bridging these worlds?

00:49:53.968 --> 00:49:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I know we've been-- that's
the whole conversation here,

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.378 align:middle line:90%
but in maybe a sum up summary.

00:50:00.378 --> 00:50:01.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Bridging requires--

00:50:01.295 --> 00:50:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Bridging requires a
desire and a heart readiness.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So my role, as I see it, is
to share all of my experiences

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that I can, not because
I'm so important,

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:16.640 align:middle line:84%
but because my experiences have
a transmission quality that can

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:90%
activate those who are ready.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, if
someone doesn't even

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:23.570 align:middle line:84%
know that these other worlds
exist as conscious bodies

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.090 align:middle line:84%
with conscious
beings, there's no way

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:84%
they will be able to access
the bridge between the worlds.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So by sharing my own
experiences rather than theory,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel that people develop
a relationship with me

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and begin to trust
in my stories.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:84%
My footpath can then open up a
similar footpath in their lives

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.915 align:middle line:84%
to be open, ask questions,
and seek connections.

00:50:44.915 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Seek connections.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:50:49.248 --> 00:50:51.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're trying
to do here with the show

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and with our audience here.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all
asking the questions.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.940 align:middle line:10%
And it's such an honor
to have Lyrica here

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:10%
to be able to bring through such
amazing messages for everyone.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.990 align:middle line:90%
So grate-- super grateful.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I am finally settled down
to share my inner heart truth

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because without heart, intellect
is a poor guidance system that

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:43.240 align:middle line:90%
goes off track easily.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And if I had one
wish, it would be

00:51:47.940 --> 00:52:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to help deprogram the
parenting and societal values

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that mom calls pushing children
to be lawyers, doctors,

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Indian chiefs, to success,
material success, fame,

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.060 align:middle line:90%
fortune.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It is such a dead-end
street, but often, that's

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where it finally hit their
truth and begin to look

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.480 align:middle line:90%
for another road to travel.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's where we're at.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people are
coming to that realization.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.625 align:middle line:84%
The world has enough
lawyers, enough doctors,

00:53:00.625 --> 00:53:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and what was the other one?

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Indian chiefs.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.574 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
Indigenous wondrous ones.

00:53:06.574 --> 00:53:07.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:53:07.532 --> 00:53:07.690 align:middle line:90%
No, that's the--

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:08.785 align:middle line:90%
>> That's like the ego.

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The guru ones, yeah.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the ego dancing
on stage kind of-

00:53:13.647 --> 00:53:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure, sure.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Showing.

00:53:14.745 --> 00:53:17.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we definitely have
way too much of that stuff.

00:53:17.037 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:90%
So well, thank you so much.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing--
again, an honor.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I know this has been
a long journey for us.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And you, Lyrica, thank
you for all your patience

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.235 align:middle line:84%
all these years and to continue
to do these interviews.

00:53:29.235 --> 00:53:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for doing the
shows that you're doing

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:36.045 align:middle line:90%
and enlightening humanity, and--

00:53:36.045 --> 00:53:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just-- I'm having fun.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just exploring,
asking the questions.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.085 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad that we have
a curious audience that

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:42.885 align:middle line:90%
goes along with me.

00:53:42.885 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but the quality of
people that you're pulling

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in, attracting magnetically
is such a testimony to how

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:59.410 align:middle line:84%
on track and how much the
universe wants this information

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.210 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, it's kind of
like you're in it for the ride.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly.

00:54:05.885 --> 00:54:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you have a
car that drives itself.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have a career
that drives itself.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.495 align:middle line:90%
And you just have to show up.

00:54:12.495 --> 00:54:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have to show up
and hit the record button.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the
batteries are charged.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.882 align:middle line:90%
>> I got it.

00:54:17.882 --> 00:54:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, then the editing.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.535 align:middle line:10%
That's the hard part.

00:54:19.535 --> 00:54:20.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:54:20.335 --> 00:54:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got help with Steve
here on that and all the work

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:25.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Steve, too.

00:54:25.252 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:10%
You're a big part
of this amazing work

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.550 align:middle line:10%
and changing the
world, changing lives,

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:35.760 align:middle line:10%
changing perspectives
and beliefs,

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.706 align:middle line:10%
and all that good stuff.

00:54:37.706 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You think Lyrica might
be up for a group hug.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a tradition I
do at the end of these now.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I am so wasted,
but in a good way.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.410 align:middle line:90%

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there we go.

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.980 align:middle line:84%
She's saying you're
too high up there.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.995 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she kissed your heart.

00:55:05.995 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Did she get that?
