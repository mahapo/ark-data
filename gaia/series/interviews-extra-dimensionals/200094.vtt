00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We are truly a holographic
being that has offloaded all

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
of its qualities and conditions.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
alien strains are

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
beginning to reveal themselves
not as something else,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:84%
but in a way a deeper allowance
of our own greater roots.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Because think of star
travel as star seeding.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, it's not to go
there because you would

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
impose yourself on a
planet, but to seed yourself

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:90%
into that planet.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And think of that
not being one system.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in a holograph,
interestingly enough,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
like an atom, you have
to cover the field

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of all the probabilities.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
If you think of reaching a
point where what we need to know

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.568 align:middle line:84%
can't be known by simply
building another piano.

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
really is this question of,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.902 align:middle line:90%
how do we trust the instrument?

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:10%
How do we trust that the
deep archeology of who we are

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:10%
is showing up?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's showing up
humanized, otherwise

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:90%
it would sweep us away.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And when it does
usually it becomes

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:90%
very confusing for people.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel like
that's why everything

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:90%
wants to bring us back really.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Like the universe
collapsing into the palm

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of the hand saying, I
want to calm your heart,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:84%
because here in is the truth
that you are all of this,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
but also the great gift
that you are uniquely you.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:10%
Understand that this on
9/11, 2001, expressed itself

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:10%
as The Hieroglyph
Of The Human Soul.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:10%
This is what it told me it was.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
10 years into working on The
Hyroglyph Of The Human Soul,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I think, well,
what's the acronym?

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's T-H-O-T-H-S, which
is THOTH, or Thoth's library,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.445 align:middle line:84%
which helps us understand the
journey of as above, so below.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:36.245 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.692 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:37.492 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.467 align:middle line:84%
That's why if you think about a
symbolical theater, everything

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that is a picture language
is trying to establish,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
as the ancestors have, once
we can talk in pictures,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
your ancestors might interpret
the pictures differently,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
but they're going
to hit on the same,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.577 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, notes,
the same qualities.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
things to our pattern

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
now, to understand that this
journey that begins on 9/11,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and I've been painting every
day for the last 17 years,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is the story of
a deeper devotion

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and love, to the story of,
at least where I live, let

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
these things matter.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think art is
for all of us where

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
we see not the judgment of
others, but the welcoming.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Saying, if we can
inspire one another

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
rather than critique
one another,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
we'll hold a space not of
debate, but of celebration.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's why this is my home.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very important
to think about context.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.455 align:middle line:84%
In your home, you live
in 24 hours a day.

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
through all the weather

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
conditions of your life.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're at home, you're
living with those you love.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And that you have to navigate
the different personalities.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Love is a difficult thing,
but so is a well-written play.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:90%
So is a well painted painting.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And we're great art.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
If we were, in a
sense, not so complex,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
if we could unriddle ourselves,
would be far less interesting.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But the deeper we go into
the mystery, as we know,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
the deeper the mystery takes us.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.546 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
happens in this room.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.025 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready?

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.711 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of had this
conversation going here,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
on the run, setting
up, but who are you?

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:90%
In a nut shell.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a very good question.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Not to be overly
philosophical, I--

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
my name is Leigh
McCloskey, and I have had

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:90%
a professional acting career.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Possibly known to some
of your audience members

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:90%
from shows like "Dallas" and--

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
"General Hospital", and
"Inferno" with Dario Argento.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of different--

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I had a very long acting career.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But during those days, I
also had the good fortune

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to meet Carla, my wife, back
in actually my first show,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:90%
back in '75, '76.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:90%
We got married in '78.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And we've lived here
for the last 39 years.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So we've lived here since 1981.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We've had and raised
our two daughters.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And we just had a grandchild.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm now happy grandfather.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm the son of Malibu.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It's where I grew up.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:90%
So my home is in Malibu.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the story
that I talk about really

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is about that sense
of finding home.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Because who am I as a
great question in a sense,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
if I talk about myself in
terms of career I'm one thing.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But really, I think the
career and a lot of us

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
are saying that we've all been
the custodians of something

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
more precious that maybe the
world wasn't interested in,

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:90%
but we were.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had 39 years
of discussion groups

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
here every Tuesday night.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking into Eastern
traditional, Western tradition,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
really spending time with
Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And really trying to get at the
archeology of the human soul,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:90%
but not as a debate.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, in a way one has
to navigate the world of debate.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But when we're home, and this
I really took from acting,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is how do you create a place
where, let's get together

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and inspire each other
and like the library,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
let's draw from the resource
that we've inherited,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
because an inspired
performance is much more

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
interesting than just sitting
and complaining about things.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And so my career
was and has been

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
as an actor
professionally, which

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to live here,
which allowed me to balance

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
my life with the
conversation and need

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
for philosophical input,
but also domestic input,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.238 align:middle line:84%
the relevance of really starting
a question from where you love,

00:06:47.238 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:90%
and you're with those you love.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of this is--

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in a way, my greater identity
is made manifest through my art.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But yesterday you
said you were an archeo--

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
no, a consciousness
Kung Fu master,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
or something of that sort.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we have to become
the martial art artist

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Martial artist.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, a master martial
artist of consciousness.

00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Because martial
arts are essentially

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
knowing what to pay attention
to, what to take personally,

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and when to navigate.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
that is this, now it

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is about marshaling the sense
of the martial arts of what

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to, how
we pay attention to it.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of this is the
deeper archeology of the soul,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Archeology of the soul.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know, that's because
an archaeologist digs, right?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:90%
He's not assuming.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:90%
He's going deeper.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
She's going deeper.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
what this is trying

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to tell us is that the
last place we need to dig,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
or the place we really
need to dig to trust,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.677 align:middle line:84%
is this subjective
place of where we live.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, in a sense trying
to resolve the question of what

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
it means to be
you or me, or what

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
it means to be a man, what
it means to be a woman.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
To be-- when we understand
and honor the fact

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that there isn't
a right version,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but much more of
this sense of place,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
if we place the value
that each conversation is

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
necessary to the larger
conversation, then we have,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I think, what the
house has become.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It's always been a
place of community,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.445 align:middle line:84%
where people have said, at least
here, let these things matter.

00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So I feel all of the art was
in response to these things,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because as an actor, you're
always making your way,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to get a role,
trying to pay your bills.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
different conversation,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
because it is so dependent
on so many other factors.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.591 align:middle line:84%
But the artist-- my
dad was a painter.

00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
So I never worried
about being a painter.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:84%
My dad was too
good of a painter.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
So it freed me.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.085 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the actor that
paints, you know?

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
was this ability

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.522 align:middle line:84%
to use painting as a way
of connecting with energy,

00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
a way of connecting
with character.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
it was painting

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
when I was at Juilliard
that allowed me to find

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:90%
the violence in a character.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But also started to
relate to that sense

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
not as paint as an illustration,
but as a medium of emotion.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And this took me much more
into the indigenous direction,

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient Chinese way
of painting, which was not

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate anything, but to
really allow that expression

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.943 align:middle line:90%
to be breath itself.

00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's
very much like the actor.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, how do you connect
with the emotional breath?

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And because I was trying to find
it, it was becoming a painting.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But not a painting as
a painter, much more

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of an act of
creative engagement.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this led me, in a
way, the back door that

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
wasn't about art in a cultural
sense, but much more in,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
you'd say, almost an antidote
to how as creative beings

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
we do have to live
in a world that

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:90%
can't be about what is not--

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:90%
you know, what's not there.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
We are in a place
where we have to say

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that we do need to
cultivate, become gardeners,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of this nature of what I call
the archeology of the soil.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Give it a place to grow.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.171 align:middle line:84%
>> And through that you've
created all of this.

00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the archeology
of the soul.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.558 align:middle line:90%
This room.

00:09:58.558 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And it even calls itself The
Hieroglyph Of The Human Soul.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> The Heiroglyph of-- yeah.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's important about a
hieroglyph, because the tarot--

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.703 align:middle line:90%
all symbolical structures.

00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It will help us in our
conversation as we go deeper.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Because once we understand
why the picture language is

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
a universal language, why
math is a universal language,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
we'll begin to understand
that this is, in a way,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
where the instrument begins to
discern its greater musicality.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
In a sense, it's greater--

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:90%
would you call, greater field.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't feel displaced.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.853 align:middle line:84%
It starts to pull itself
into a greater coherence.

00:10:29.853 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would almost
liken that when

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
we step out of
being the audience

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and we step into being
part of the play.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what drew
me to this conversation

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is my series Interview with ED.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to all
these people who

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:84%
channel these extra
dimensional beings,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and E.T's from Pleiades to
Arcturias, to Zeta Reticuli,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and the information that's
coming from that conversation,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
it's leading-- it's funneling
into this conversation

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
about archetypes,
and about story.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
what they're saying.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding
all this overlay,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
from indigenous
teachings to the art--

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, when I saw your video
of the tarot explanations,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
there were so many
synchronicities and details

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
in that conversation
that I thought,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is where the next
conversation needs to happen.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I need to talk to an
archaeologist of consciousness

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to really help understand
and maybe put a--

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:84%
bring down to Earth
the conversation

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been having with these
extra dimensional beings.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It's my hope today
you can-- we can

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
dive into these different
E.T. archetypes,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and then ground them
into the archetypes

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
that we already have here.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And find the synchronicities,
and find the overlay,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and maybe have a
better understanding

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:90%
of what is all of this, right?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The myth here--

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
briefly the story

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.455 align:middle line:84%
that's emerged here,
because it's quite

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:90%
contextual and fascinating.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It says that we begin
not with not knowing,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:90%
we began as vast knowing.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, we think
at the speed of light.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
The question was, how do
we slow this light down?

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we bend the light?

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
How, as Einstein said,
slow thought down to a rate

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
where we can see it.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:84%
When this becomes our
fundamental understanding

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of this star being, we start
to understand our pyramids

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and obelisks.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.015 align:middle line:90%
They were amplifiers.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
They were all
about what we think

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of from a theatrical point of
view as rock and roll, right?

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Where you stand in the same
presence, the music lifts you.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So you're all on the same page.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not a debate over anything.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a celebration of alignment.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Coherence.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Coherence.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's the question of the
obelisk, this falling over.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
You see this falling into time
of totem poles, of obelisks.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, the upright father, the
knowledge of the divine mother

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that there's this union
of these qualities.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why symbols also are
about the divine ones, the Gods

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
coming from the ancient times.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of
this as a seed pattern,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and you start to see it
as an organic pattern,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
yes, you inseminate
with this seed ideal.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:84%
You instruct from
these ideal states.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And you would--
even the joke here

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the nine inch square
tile that this is painted on

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
said, you see, even the linoleum
had a preexisting geometry

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:90%
before I painted it.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
As if to say that these
qualities pre-exist.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:90%
They're structural.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And that we drape reality
and our understanding of that

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
upon these structural truths.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry, the
Fibonacci, all of these--

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:90%
threes, the six, the nine.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, the magical
numbers that we find

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that are throughout creation.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Fractal.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> They're keys.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
tarot are called keys.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Because once we understand
archetypes are keys,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
we start to understand
what The Library says.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.303 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand that the
North, the South, the East,

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and the West here all exist,
all the books you like

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and all the books you
don't like exist here.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that the
conversation isn't

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
about the rejection
of any part, but this

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
going from seeing ourselves only
in reflection for and against,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.652 align:middle line:90%
to moving back into a circle.

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Is very interesting
tai chi, right?

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It's this movement.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just, as you
know, movement for movement

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
sake, but it is this
sense of creating

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
an energetic
relationship that allows

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
us to restore say
the central knowing

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:90%
that our bodies are ancient.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
See, that's what's
not understood.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.078 align:middle line:84%
We always say, oh,
this is my body.

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:35.845 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a human body
that you are within,

00:14:35.845 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
which is an extraordinary
way to think,

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that you are wrapping
within this ancient being.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
That is saying, yeah, I
don't want to overwhelm you.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I think we're on overwhelm.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the last point here
that I think is so important

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the great
revelations that came to me

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
recently is that a
painting is breath.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:90%
That when you paint you breathe.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And that a painting
captures breath.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:90%
So a painting becomes as a lung.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's why a picture--

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:90%
a picture language is important.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Because like music, it
wants to breathe us.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It wants to dissolve
resistance, because in a way,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
it insists on a
subjective relationship.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And that cultivates
trust in the truth

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that things are not
abstract for one another,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
but even in this
story of the alien

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
with the elongated head here
hearing saying that, no, you

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:90%
created the smaller head.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And the story of being born
at a time to slow down--

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you'd say like shooting an
electron into a stack of books,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
it slowed it down so
that finally you and I

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
can sit here as human.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But finally, go the other
way and realize, aw,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
but we are woven of
this great story that

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
allows us to be its expression,
but still, like this room, part

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of a living, creative womb
that is trying to say,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:90%
now you're getting it.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you're beginning to
reposition your questions.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
question of aliens,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
like the question
of love, will not

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
be the trust of the optical,
but of the creative,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and how that has influenced
storytellers, how that--

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
like you, influencing
your relationship

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:90%
with what you call creation.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
is what allows creation

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
itself on a quantum
level to say, ah,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:90%
we're being given information.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like if you
don't allow it, it can't be.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
going back to this seed

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of the out-breath, our story,
the in-breath, ourselves.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And this great love
affair that, wow, we're

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
part of an extraordinarily
heroic being.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:90%
This is over and over again.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
You won't remember,
but as you discover,

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
you'll finally put
yourself back together.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And the key, I feel, for all of
us is we don't realize it yet,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
but the time component is
like putting on our hands.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But it took a long
time, because we

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.603 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to put our
head on first, but last.

00:16:56.603 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And think of your
home being your head--

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
your heart, I mean.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Not where you live, but
really where your heart is.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I get.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It I can't connect to any of
this until I put my head on.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why the lamp
there, you see with Eve,

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.855 align:middle line:84%
is the story of the delight
of mine, was all the stories.

00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what illumines not
what we like or don't like,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
but the greater
vision of why we've

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
been willing to go through these
qualities, to finally say we're

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
And when we are home,
we're not in judgment.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We are seeking to balance
responsibility with vision,

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
keep our feet on the ground
so the branches of our tree

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:90%
don't take us off the earth.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So that leads into--
so what I wanted to do

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
in our conversation today is
sort of cover some of these

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
E.T. races that I'm sure
you're familiar with,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
many people following this
show are familiar with.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And the first one that--

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the elongated
heads and the story of birth.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
For me and my research,
it seems to connect closer

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:90%
to the race of the Arcturians.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:90%
And just to give you--

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
you've probably heard this
term, the Arcturaian race.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Yeah.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
But please--

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So my understanding from
the Arcturian exposure that

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I've had is they are
these elongated heads.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
They are the most, I
would say, advanced race

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of beings in our--

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
in this lore of E.T. Many other
beings from the palate star

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
system, and Orion,
and wherever, they

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
go on these spiritual
pilgrimages to the Arcturian

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
star system to learn the
deeper meaning of existence.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> They even have--

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
there's even a discussion
of this Arcturian gate

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that is for many beings, and I
don't know if this is for all,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
but they say that
many beings to come

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
into this reality
on Earth, they must

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
pass through this Arcturian
gate, this birth canal.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And they need the Arcturian
technology to do that.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's this womb aspect,
this giving birth aspect

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to the Arcturians.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
There's this-- they're
almost considered

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
like the Jedi of the
galaxy because they're

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.180 align:middle line:90%
so advanced in their beingness.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:84%
They're always seen
wearing robes, you know,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:90%
that traditional Jedi outfit.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:90%
They're associated with blue.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Many people see them
as bluer beings,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:90%
or have a blue tint to them.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But just to give you
that context, what would

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you connect that to as far
as the other archetypes

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:90%
that we understand?

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very intriguing, because
I think that what we're really

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
dealing with is the
above, the below,

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:90%
and the in-between being one.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that, quite literally,
you see the territory.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is the relationship
you would almost

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
say of the first five
archetypes of the omegas.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.682 align:middle line:84%
Not the magician, but the
omegas, the seed bearer,

00:20:06.682 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and the high priestess.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
In the sense, the inside and
outside, but you start to see

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.050 align:middle line:90%
it divides in one way.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They give birth,
essentially, to the empress,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and this is Sophia.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
This would be this room, and
womb meaning that from no thing

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:90%
is born.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And then her mirror, her
reflection is the emperor.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have this quality
like yin yang, do you see?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:90%
The one within the other.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.317 align:middle line:90%
>> And the fifth.

00:20:30.317 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
feel the Arcturians are,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.072 align:middle line:90%
which is right here.

00:20:33.072 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right in the center.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you see?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.982 align:middle line:84%
It actually corresponds
with the Milky Way.

00:20:35.982 --> 00:20:37.503 align:middle line:90%
It's this corpus callosum.

00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the line between.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's also if you
use this as the eye.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That we're born
looking into the world.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the greater
lens of wonder.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
to a great degree,

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that quality doesn't
exist in time.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It does exist in depth, and
those qualities therefore

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
are, almost you would say,
the filtering qualities

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of universal life force, which
is translating itself, slowing

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
itself down into a
human scale, meaning

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that in itself as a universal
or archetypal force,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:90%
it would be overwhelming.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that much of this--

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
think of trying to remind you,
but more like with lightning.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't light up, because
then you'd want to go there.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But more like to light up,
and realize that we as human

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
now are a composite
of these qualities.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Meaning going back to
Atlantis, the sons of Belial

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:90%
and the sons of the One God.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It's this story
that we've actually

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
assimilated all these qualities,
and that's why I would.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
Arcturians are, in a way,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:90%
the pattern keepers.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I think this has a
lot to do with this,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:84%
because this quality of
consciousness is the library.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And it would say our
quality is always

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to translate star knowledge
into the terminology of a given

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:84%
planet to essentially
humanize it.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So they are the guardians
of star systems.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
This is what becomes
an intriguing quality

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
of a unifying principle.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, maybe
different worlds

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
are looking for a
unifying principle

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
in that what has escaped our
attention is, like atoms, we

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
have had to cluster in
our particular uniformity.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And now, maybe what
this is getting at is,

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like speaking of
the quintessence alchemically,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that the four
directions, of the--

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
air, earth, fire, and
water, the four qualities

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:84%
are brought together
in the center.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you think of that
going, in a way, this way,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and that being why.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And it aligns with the Maya
calendar ending on the winter

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
solstice, because this is where
the quality of consciousness,

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
you see, stops, and
it's rotating in time,

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and stands erect.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the
Torah, this is also

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:84%
what allows the
stargate to open,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to be translated into knowledge,
and come up through our root

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
system in a way, our
own human equation.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if we experience
something untranslatable,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:90%
it remains there.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The genius of our filtration
is to take this Arcturian

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.088 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:22:59.088 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I really do feel that
you could look at these

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.297 align:middle line:84%
as, if you were diagramming
it as in the old Renaissance

00:23:05.297 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:90%
diagrams, you'd say, yeah.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:84%
This is really like the
Seraphim, the dominions,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:84%
the cherubim, that you're
really looking at qualities

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that,
in their very physiology

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
reveal it is not the
forward mind that we have.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.627 align:middle line:84%
It's this very elongated sense
of the flow, so those would be.

00:23:26.627 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you start to even-- you can--

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.297 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more imaginative--
and I think that's why

00:23:30.297 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
it's very good to use an actor's
tool of creating a character,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that many of these
things aren't meant--

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
they're meant to be tinctures.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.358 align:middle line:84%
They're meant to, a bit like
a poem, light up in you,

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's
important that we

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:84%
trust that you're not trying
to gather one localized

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:90%
sense of meaning.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you're always
gathered around this greater

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:90%
mystery.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.317 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's finding
the greater mystery, going,

00:23:52.317 --> 00:23:53.901 align:middle line:84%
that's actually the
nourishment that's

00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to awaken why you
need to trust your curiosity,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
because the only way to
translate these things is not,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
in a way, just to download them,
but to actually transmute them.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And think of our
dream life, right?

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We're always trying
to create in--

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.112 align:middle line:84%
we always realize in dreams
that it's symbolical.

00:24:13.112 --> 00:24:13.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But we don't look at
our own life that way,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
don't look at--

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So many people, yeah.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --the Arcturians, we don't
look at them as those that are

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to say, once you free
yourself from the optics,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and you trust that
you are a navigator,

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
then this greater mind
doesn't, in a way,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.567 align:middle line:84%
make you want to float away but
gives you almost like I felt

00:24:33.567 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:90%
with the cathedral, right?

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You walk in this harsh
life, see the rose windows,

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and be restored to a sense
of, there's a greater beauty,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:90%
this is the breath I needed.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting out
of anything, but I'm

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
being restored by being reminded
that there is something more

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:90%
beautiful than difficulty.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.543 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
on the vertical,

00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's the
wisdom of the library, right?

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That you stand in a
beauty that's unimaginable,

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
because it came not because
of something but in spite

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:90%
of something.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It never overcame evil, but
it was in spite of that evil

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.322 align:middle line:90%
that it still chose.

00:25:07.322 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to save
the Arcturians for last,

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but it just kind
of came in as the--

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel maybe
that's the larger theater.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And if we can put
ourselves in that mind,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I even have drawings where
I was exploring this,

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was because my
dad would always say,

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't talk
about something painted.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.465 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had
philosophical discussions

00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:90%
which were fascinating.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So I always use drawing as
a way of asking questions,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I was
so surprised when

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
these elongated heads, these
qualities kept showing up.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And there were
other alien forms,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
structures that would show up.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kept feeling that
they were trying to,

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
like dream imagery, slowly
move me away from assumption,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and then to lead into,
we are in communion.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way,
a book in the library

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
is not to come at you
but for your curiosity

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to finally join us.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Join you.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And like a book, as
you join us in communion,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
will start to transform
the questions you ask.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what happened
to you? >> That's

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:90%
exactly what happened.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:90%
I had the questions.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw something
out of this world,

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and then I began
to ask questions.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And here we are 10 years
later, 10-plus years,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and the questions
have been refined.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I'm still
asking the questions,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
but they're sculpted
questions now.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
They're--

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:26:28.956 --> 00:26:29.392 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:26:29.392 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%
They're lived questions.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.817 align:middle line:90%
They're earned questions.

00:26:31.817 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Earned questions.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
One last thing on
the Arcturians.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:10%
So the Arcturian race
or the Arcturian Star

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:10%
is, I believe,
the brightest star

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.190 align:middle line:10%
in the northern hemisphere.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:10%
It's also associated in
the bear constellation.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be more versed
in this stuff, but I'm not.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the bear,
actually, completely.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just kind of--

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of comes,
and I'm like, oh,

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I take these little nuggets
that kind of resonate.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
No, I kind of feel like
that's the romance of it.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to burden
yourself with remembering.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to, in a way,
rediscover it continually.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:08.086 align:middle line:84%
What is the bear in your
archetypal research?

00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The bear is fascinating,
because I mean,

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
from indigenous symbology,
but even in alchemy,

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:90%
the bear is the great mother.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So she's-- and
this is, of course,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:84%
the narrative of the
Pleiades, from the Pleiades,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
the sense of the great
mother, the great bear,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you
have the Bear Clan,

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
this relationship to the stars.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But also, if we don't look at
that simply from the surface,

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
but begin to understand
the power of the bear,

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
begin to become the
bear, begin to feel

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:90%
how that feels in the body.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This is also what you
would say if we're

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
supplying the emotional nature
to a composite human form.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the part
of the qualities

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy within
us that become,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.292 align:middle line:90%
do you see, this deeper nature?

00:27:50.292 --> 00:27:51.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:27:51.092 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'd almost say
part of the door then is,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:90%
how does this energy feel?

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what connects
us, again, not optically,

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.212 align:middle line:84%
because that's in time, which
is the illusion, but in tone.

00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what's very
interesting about the bear,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
again, being this look to why I
take on different animal forms

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.938 align:middle line:84%
in terms of different
constellations.

00:28:11.938 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because every animal-- this
is, of course, martial arts

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It has a particular
universal wisdom and is centered

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in a type of genius alignment
that, as we learn from them,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
we become, in a sense, the
gatherer of their wisdom.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot of
the indigenous teachings

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
use the spirit animals,
and they use the connecting

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to these animals as
a teacher, as a guide

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to, again, archetypal stuff that
we see in our cave paintings

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and in our hieroglyphics.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And Chinese writing
and Asian writing

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
uses a closer version
to the hieroglyphs.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
It's iconic, legendary --

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> With the kanji and--

00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:28:59.933 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.708 align:middle line:84%
>> So just seeing all these
correlations, and we're--

00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and now, we simplify
things, and simplify things,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.583 align:middle line:90%
and simplify things.

00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But then a lot gets lost,
because it's too simple.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I almost feel
like that's the question,

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is that once we see that
we're always languaging,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
but like Adam, always naming,
is that it wasn't one language.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like the
minutia of languaging

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that would finally free us to
realize, oh, botany, alchemy,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
all these different,
in a way, disciplines,

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
when we think from the library's
perspective or the larger

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
perspective, they're
all necessary ways

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
of languaging into human story
these greater conditions.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
In a way, slowing all these
different star connections.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a Renaissance
model of macrocosm, microcosm,

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
man being the
universe in miniature,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
Vitruvian Man of Leonardo,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
we begin to realize
why all of the organs

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.290 align:middle line:84%
have both the attribution
of a star or of a planet,

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and that the body's health,
is as Paracelsus taught,

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that we are not essentially
deterministic in terms

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of the stars.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But the genius is that it is
what he called the Greater Man,

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the Homo Maximus, meaning that
the heavens held the design

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:84%
of who and what we were--
we were the Homo Minorus--

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and that that
greater pattern then

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:90%
showed in the star structure.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And as the stars
came and went, he

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:84%
said this created the
archetypal structure.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The genius of our
star system is that it

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
lets us have a conversation with
our greater nature, do you see?

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> By projecting it into
these archetypal and planetary

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.368 align:middle line:90%
influences.

00:30:42.368 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, if you
were trying to have, like,

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I had an orb manifestation here.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It was very extraordinary.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was pictures
taken of the orbs

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:90%
in geometrical relationship.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I realized here they had
a structure where they could

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
finally reveal not,
again, through words

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but through relationship
and remarkable photographs,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that we are trying to
create a condition.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Think of your brain being
this little pea in the middle

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:90%
of an enormous being.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.498 align:middle line:84%
And it wants everything to
sort of be on human terms.

00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of these different
parts of the body are going,

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:84%
no, no, no, you'll
never get, in a sense,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get to
Saturn, you'll never

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
get to-- so don't
make it about what

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
you're not, but begin to turn,
as we did in the Renaissance.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
holographic knowledge is

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.008 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the models
are so important now,

00:31:30.008 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:84%
because they're saying, of
course, we are a projection.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
We are-- if you
think of here, right,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
as the lens, the
library, you'd say,

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:84%
we are the projection
into an atomic body,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:90%
meaning a light body, right?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>> A scintillating energy
body that's holding,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
through some form of
generosity, all of its atoms.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.470 align:middle line:84%
All of its universe is
scintillating, carrying

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
on all of their business, and
pancreas, and heart and all

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, to finally
say, but wait a minute.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.605 align:middle line:84%
Just like that, and
just like the library,

00:32:00.605 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:84%
so little of what
you can actually know

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
is what is comprehensible.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
What is comprehensible
is the fact that you

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
are the center of this
awareness, do you see?

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Like a sea captain finally
going, oh, I get it.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a vessel.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't own the sea, nor do--

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to understand that
I've needed to build a vessel

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.842 align:middle line:84%
to let me navigate these waters,
but the mystery of the waters

00:32:21.842 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:84%
will never be solved,
because the waters aren't

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:84%
interested in what
the vessel thinks.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautifully said.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that sums up this
experience, I think.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But Bashar always
says, we always

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
feel that the soul is
inside of the body.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, he
says it's reversed.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The soul is creating the
body, and we are not--

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.290 align:middle line:90%
the soul is not housed inside.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:84%
The body is housed
inside the soul.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:90%
So if we can sort of get--

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
do the reverse thing on
what we've been taught

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and sort of see the
world in that way.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The soul is actually
the water, and the body

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:84%
is navigating the soul which
we, in the waters, that is us.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So, and when we can
see it that way,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:84%
then navigating this experience
becomes a little less

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
stressful, because
we kind of can

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:90%
understand that I am the water.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I may not fully grasp that,
fully understand that now,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
but if I just have that knowing
so as things are delivered

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to me, experiences, and
situations, and relationships,

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:84%
then I don't judge them,
and I don't put them--

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --away.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I can accept them as, this is
me delivering me a present.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, which allows me
to be more present in time.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But think of that as
permission, and I mean,

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:90%
think about performing.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We are what we have to
stumble over until we finally

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
give ourself
permission to go, just

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:90%
make an ass out of yourself.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Step up, and something
frees you to finally go,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to figure it out.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.826 align:middle line:90%
I need to give myself to it.

00:34:09.826 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:90%
It'll figure it out.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And I almost feel like
that's the boat on the shore.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
We've built the boat,
we know the piano,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.413 align:middle line:90%
but we're not playing the piano.

00:34:15.413 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
We think the boat can
be left on the sand,

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
and fight over what
kind of boat you have.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:22.457 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of feel like we're
actually being set adrift,

00:34:22.457 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're finding ourselves
in a different medium, which

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is the medium of the
ocean itself coming up

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
in these tidal waves,
literally, in one way or another

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.440 align:middle line:84%
in people's lives
that are, I think,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:84%
upsetting rocking the
boat, so to speak.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of that as a
trigger of suddenly waking up

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:84%
in a dream and going,
oh man, I thought

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I was on land, because
like, give me an oar.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
You start to-- and we realize
that the genius of who we are

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:90%
is, we adapt very quickly.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's even
on a deeper level,

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.449 align:middle line:84%
I think of the Arcturians
as almost Arthur

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:55.179 align:middle line:84%
and the Arthurians,
the sense of,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that Arthur says that the
ideal of the Grail of Camelot

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.910 align:middle line:90%
was no one of us.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It was each of us held to
the ideal of the possibility

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:07.480 align:middle line:90%
of such a thing.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And each night, went on his
own journey, his own adventure.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that each night
he would attain the Grail.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It was this realization that
the stories we brought back

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
of attaining and
not attaining would

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:84%
create a sense of
the shared truth

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that the Grail isn't
anyone's story.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not in its attainment.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:84%
It's in how it
transforms the life.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.245 align:middle line:84%
So this whole sense of Arthur
is that all ideals of Camelot,

00:35:33.245 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and this was during the
beginning of the ego,

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:84%
so it was a battle, and it was
about a sword in the stone.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But this story is what
happens after Camelot

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.850 align:middle line:84%
falls, after we have lost
that greater outer ideal.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the ashes,
we are asked to find

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:84%
once again that Grail, but
not as that which is, again,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:84%
as you talked about, outward,
but a deeper inner light.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's what we graph
onto as storytellers and living

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
through these
things, to really say

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that, I don't want
to tell you something

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I think you ought to know.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to share
with you something

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I think might inspire you,
and that lifts us both.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
choice, and where we're

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:90%
at now, and why a lot of--

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of going
back to the races,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
we might look at
these as archetypal

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and perceptual rings that
were composed of almost

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:90%
like, how do we rise up?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.708 align:middle line:90%
Even as an acting exercise.

00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have
an elongated head.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel
a serpentine body.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:90%
How does this feel?

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.308 align:middle line:84%
I want you to rise
up into that knowing.

00:36:36.308 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I want you to feel the library.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you see you see?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
You start to say, oh, it
was an acting exercise.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.608 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I could do it, because
I'm not having to believe it.

00:36:42.608 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
what a lot of these things

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:90%
are trying to say.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, now you're using your
art, your creative qualities,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
your imagination to
free your improvisation.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And think of a
relationship, right?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So long as you believe in me,
we're not in a relationship.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But once we believe
in our relationship,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:90%
we'll discover one another.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that the
creative process as well?

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't know
how to do something.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It grows.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It grows from your curiosity
and the willingness

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand that the
relationship is not

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in achieving something
but in realizing,

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
as in all relationships, it's
the process of, in a way,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.070 align:middle line:84%
getting it wrong,
figuring it out.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:22.870 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that, I'm
convinced, if we look at it

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.730 align:middle line:84%
as a martial art is
saying, most of what's

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:90%
training you is not words.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's, I'm teaching you
what to pay attention to.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching you what's real.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching you.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.070 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and just like in the
dream, all of the players--

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung says, I believe,
that they're all you.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all aspects of you.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:90%
So if you can--

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.870 align:middle line:84%
this waking dream, if we can
have that same point of view

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and we can adapt that, then
the dream becomes more lucid.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think then, the
characters aren't being

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
believed in, so they're
willing to participate.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know, and if you
think of the veil being,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I want you to draw me forth.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
I want you to create music.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do it so
it's a love affair with me,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:84%
because in a way, just to be
entitled-- oh, yes, finally,

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:84%
we've proven that
there's aliens.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that the whole point
is that, of course there are,

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
going to show up.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:84%
They're more
interesting than that.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Because in a way, that
which doesn't show up

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.408 align:middle line:84%
forces us to create space for
the willingness for engagement.

00:38:25.408 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's why this
becomes a very sacred space.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.117 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, the
unexpected temple,

00:38:29.117 --> 00:38:32.080 align:middle line:84%
because who would-- in a
sense, there's nothing.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:90%
This is the act of love.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I rather feel like that's
when our celestial elders say,

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:84%
once you understand that we
off loaded into the books,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:84%
we translated ourselves
into multi-dimensionality

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
like with the 3D
effect here, so look

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:90%
at us in more than one way.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll begin to
understand that it

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is a time of relationship,
not a proof, this sense

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of looking at things
in more than one way,

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and looking at each other
in more than one way,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to say, yes,
we're on that journey of life.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a force that
said, at the end of the day,

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
you realize the hands that
shape you are always invisible,

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
because if you see the hands,
you assume that they are doing

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:84%
it, rather than in
a way you'd almost

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
say they're the resistance that
allows you to shape yourself.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.400 align:middle line:84%
That, I believe, hits
the nail on the head.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what is the apple?

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this story,
it's the story of Eve.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:84%
She says that the gift of the
apple is the gift of life.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:10%
The chalice is the gift of
the love of Adam and Eve,

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:10%
meaning that the gift of the
womb is that Eve said to Adam,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:10%
your love is so profound.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:10%
Your thoughts are so wonderful.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:10%
You must allow them to be born.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about that.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.550 align:middle line:84%
We have entered from the realm
of eternal and timelessness

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
into time.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.075 align:middle line:84%
So the once grand
cosmological fires,

00:39:59.075 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:84%
do you see, of [INAUDIBLE],,
and it's been divided,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:90%
are no longer ever present.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we think about
that as a love story,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:84%
right, once we were
Isis and Osiris.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:84%
We were gods and goddesses who
were aligned with the stars.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we turn
from this time of love

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.910 align:middle line:90%
into a time of separation.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
journey will show us,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that to understand
who we are uniquely,

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we can move
to where I just showed you,

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the chalice, the sense of the
movement into the chalice,

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
or we'll start to look
down and see the blossom,

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:90%
or look down and see the mother.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look over
here, do you see?

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see the
ancestors, the Maya.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking back
into a time of fire.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, look at that.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what
the ancestors know.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We're the keepers
of the records.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they really are.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> They are the keepers.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They're called --

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is the whole--

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --the time keepers.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole journey of
Pahana, the Lost White Brother,

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:90%
interestingly enough, is this.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:90%
We will keep this connection.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:06.020 align:middle line:84%
You will go into the world,
you see, on this great exodus.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You will take the
journey of the world,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and you will return
to the ancestors.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And your learned journey will
finally have a basis in wisdom,

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:90%
and that's really where we look.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Think of this story, that
this is all connected, right?

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting
to see this journey

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:26.243 align:middle line:90%
of the mother and the father.

00:41:26.243 --> 00:41:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
becomes even more curious

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and delightful, because
behind the blossom,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.170 align:middle line:84%
you can see I'm
holding the blossom.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And for my physicists out
there, and location and speed

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.270 align:middle line:84%
of the electron,
this is suggesting

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that the location
is the human story,

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.080 align:middle line:84%
but that the energy behind it
is the lost knowledge which

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
isn't really lost of the goddess
of Lilith, because she's here.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And nothing expresses the
layered psyche better than

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that you see these are
two qualities of oneness,

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that the one direction, we
see the purpose, the blossom.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And on the other direction,
we see the roots, the energy.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are both two
qualities of the one.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.918 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about, in
a visual language,

00:42:20.918 --> 00:42:22.460 align:middle line:84%
this is the knowledge
of the goddess,

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:90%
the time of the goddess.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.515 align:middle line:84%
And why I say that is, we
saw the apple over there.

00:42:26.515 --> 00:42:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see the
apple over here,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.360 align:middle line:84%
but you see it's over
my family photo album.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:90%
So we think about family.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the capacity
to see each other

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:90%
in generation and with love.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the knowledge
of the goddess.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be very important,

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.920 align:middle line:84%
because the sacrifice
of the goddess

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is when we turn away
from direct knowing.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why
Lilith is rejected,

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and Eve becomes
the wife of Adam.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Both must be ignorant
of their origins.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.380 align:middle line:90%
But Lilith is inside of Eve.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
She says that, I will
be the lioness that

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:84%
lives at the heart
of woman, as Eve

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.870 align:middle line:84%
will be betrayed by
Adam, because Adam

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:13.790 align:middle line:90%
will turn into self-reflection.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And on that hall of
mirrors, on that journey,

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:84%
he will betray love
over and over again.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
of this betrayal,

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's so beautiful
here, is she says that, now,

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that I have
always been present but hidden

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.370 align:middle line:84%
until now, because you cannot
know your story until you

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
realize that you are
not on the horizontal,

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:90%
but on the vertical.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You are trees.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, if you
live in Malibu as a tree,

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:84%
you don't try to get to Santa
Monica, and that's her point.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
She's going to say that,
I turned myself inward.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do that
literally, do you see?

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And we will cover the
family photo albums.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And the question became,
even as a motion picture,

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:57.090 align:middle line:84%
well, why did we
take this journey?

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well,
take me with you.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So we start to journey
around the corner here.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
becomes so movable,

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:14.520 align:middle line:84%
because this space then
shows us the two hemispheres.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that, do
you see, in the mirror?

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.302 align:middle line:90%
The journey of self-reflection?

00:44:20.302 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you
look at this side,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:84%
do you see your journey
of the mother, of love?

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, we would not be
aware that there's

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
a division between
the progressions,

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:84%
that love connects
and thought divides.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful thing
here is actually, suddenly,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
now, we hold the
story of our-- you

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
see, what we think of as
alien, but it's really

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.193 align:middle line:90%
this greater self.

00:44:49.193 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> The elongated head.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The elongated head.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you see it looks
like a child in this?

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Again, innocent.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The quality here is, in this
innocence, in this ancientness,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.980 align:middle line:84%
in this knowingness, we cannot,
and this is the Lilith story,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.670 align:middle line:84%
we cannot convince ourselves
that we are separate.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.630 align:middle line:90%
We know too much.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how do
we create, quite literally,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a smaller head and take
what was once in union

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and divide it as a right angle?

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you start to see
this twin over and over again,

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:84%
as if to say the Ark, like
the two hemispheres, emerges,

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:29.660 align:middle line:90%
do you see?

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:35.150 align:middle line:84%
From this greater vision
when we hold that as a tree.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Torah, I
showed you earlier, is saying,

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
you grow out of
this root system.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:84%
But this consciousness for
you is incomprehensible.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you cut it in half

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.130 align:middle line:90%
to slow it down and humanize it.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But from a human
context now, you

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:84%
have access to this
other quality, which is--

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.410 align:middle line:90%
think of the story here.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking in this
direction, we can't see Lilith.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a primary
technology which

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:84%
is very helpful, because once
we understand that, then the--

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you say primary
like primal almost?

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, exactly, because we
have been painting since we

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
began, never to
illustrate anything,

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.108 align:middle line:90%
but to create community.

00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Think of the dance,
the improvisation

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of the hand, the sense of
feeling the wood, feeling

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:84%
all of this that allows us to
follow the grain, to feel--

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.132 align:middle line:84%
everything has these
hidden patterns,

00:46:27.132 --> 00:46:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's whether we
see the watcher language.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm really allowing
the rhythmic nature

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.770 align:middle line:84%
not to illustrate anything,
and to rise more and more

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to bring into focus.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea Lilith was.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no illustration here.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why as
I bring this out,

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.670 align:middle line:84%
do you see, even the sense
of having it on cards,

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And it will show us that you
have been on this journey

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:84%
across the ages, gathering
the story of what

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.580 align:middle line:90%
does it mean to be human.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.770 align:middle line:84%
You came from the
mother of light,

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:84%
you were drawn down
into the mother of dark.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.470 align:middle line:84%
You now bring these two
qualities together, do you see?

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And one, like the painting,
cannot see the other side

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of the other.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:84%
This is why if we
have this, it says,

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I want you to remember like you
can remember the downstairs is

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:90%
there, even if we're not there.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember so that your
imagination allows you

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to connect that
which you cannot see.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's where she
then comes out, as I say.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the goddess,
the ancient one, returns home.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But this knowledge
can't be known

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.770 align:middle line:84%
except in the domestic
space, because that's

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:90%
the truth of lover and beloved.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's why her
evolution is, I

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.820 align:middle line:10%
will take you back
to Atlantean Nori.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.490 align:middle line:10%
I will take you back to
the time of the Watchers.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But I won't take you
back there to leave.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:90%
That's narcissism.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.475 align:middle line:84%
That's telling me
you're an ancient King,

00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and you don't need to
be here, because you're

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.370 align:middle line:90%
so important there.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is the great
terror of narcissism,

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is because Lilith destroys
the illusion of the illusion.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the Hall of Mirrors of
the Ego that are now, in a way,

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.670 align:middle line:84%
facing the creative
spirit and that truth

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that the creative spirit isn't
interested in your cosmology,

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.000 align:middle line:84%
but really interested
in your willingness

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to do what she's saying,
which is follow me

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.300 align:middle line:90%
into this great story.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And you got our
magic GoPro over there.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get into the next race,
which you mentioned Pleiadians

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
earlier, and that's sort of one
of these key archetypal races

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:84%
that many, many people--
probably the most famous race,

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.727 align:middle line:84%
I would say, of all of the
races are the most channeled.

00:48:41.727 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:84%
More people are
channeling Pleiadians.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
There's more discussion
around the Pleiadians

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.260 align:middle line:90%
than most of the other races.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And the archetypes
around that is that it's

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.690 align:middle line:90%
a very feminine energy.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The lore is that
they are cousins.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.320 align:middle line:84%
They come-- they evolved
from Lyra, the Lyrian star

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:90%
system and that lineage.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're the Seven Sisters
from the Pleiadian star system

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and associated with the
bird or avian energy.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.270 align:middle line:84%
The original sort of
Pleiadian perspective

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that we had in the old days
was, blonde hair, blue eyes.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Nordics, so to say.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But we're learning now
through my channel interviews,

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and other material,
and other visitations

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians,
and this is probably

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.770 align:middle line:90%
with all races, really.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:90%
It's such a-- it's a vast race.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge star system.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Not just the Seven
Sisters, but that's all we

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:84%
can see from our
telescopes and whatnot.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually go into
that pocket of the star system,

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.988 align:middle line:90%
it's very vast, and there's--

00:50:00.988 --> 00:50:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Seventh
Star is invisible,

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.343 align:middle line:84%
so you can't actually
see it from this.

00:50:04.343 --> 00:50:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting, that.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mayans talk about
the Pleiadians coming,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.200 align:middle line:84%
or the beings from the Pleidians
coming and giving them this

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.420 align:middle line:84%
book of knowledge that
gave them arithmetic,

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and farming practices,
and sort of--

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I forget the name
of the book that

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.220 align:middle line:84%
carries the sacred
knowledge to get them

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.943 align:middle line:90%
through their hard times.

00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> To this, three days of
darkness during these changing

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:43.190 align:middle line:90%
of these 5,200 year cycles.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, so with all that--

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and there's a lot more.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just skimming
on the surface.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But where do you feel
the connections are?

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> That when we begin to
understand, and we can use it--

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.530 align:middle line:84%
this is where archetypes
have been very helpful,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because essentially, you would
almost say that the Arcturians

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:84%
are more the fool in the
tarot, the capacity both in it

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.890 align:middle line:90%
and the causation of it.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that this
is where we start to step

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.600 align:middle line:84%
into a different relationship
where the Pleiadians really

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.952 align:middle line:90%
become "Th-oth" or Thoth.

00:51:16.952 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But this makes Thoth's
library, interestingly enough.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Hieroglyph
of the Human Soul,

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.055 align:middle line:90%
so this becomes Thoth's library.

00:51:22.055 --> 00:51:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And Thoth is the beak.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he is headed--

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> The avian.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's the one, really,
that becomes the herald,

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the teacher of
agriculture, math,

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:middle line:90%
all of the great principles.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we think of Hermes
as well, this as above,

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:40.238 align:middle line:84%
so below, this becomes the
sense that the Pleiadians

00:51:40.238 --> 00:51:41.780 align:middle line:84%
are involved in the
seven principles,

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that there's a Septenary nature
to man, the seventh principle

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:90%
being invisible.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the projection
into the star system

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.678 align:middle line:84%
is we see this projected
back to us, so it becomes

00:51:49.678 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:90%
a philosophical template.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost correlating
with the chakras.

00:51:52.345 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it lives in us.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's transmuted
through our imagination.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Not to go there, but to actually
realize we're arising out

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.550 align:middle line:90%
of these different conditions.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.217 align:middle line:84%
You're almost saying,
oh, I'm rising out

00:52:03.217 --> 00:52:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of this crown chakra, out of
this Arcturian connectedness

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of systems down into--

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:90%
not down.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:10.910 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hierarchical.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It's, in a sense, the
qualities that when

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.860 align:middle line:84%
we think of the
Septenary nature,

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:84%
this is where we think of
the base of the pyramid--

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the four and the three
rising to the apex.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the hidden center at
the apex when we rise out

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
conditions, but the quality

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.950 align:middle line:84%
of setting the structures,
of building the pyramid,

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.530 align:middle line:84%
creating the
conditions, that allows

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.700 align:middle line:84%
for the interface with this
other mind is, I believe,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the genius of the Pleiadians.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, they're
star system builders

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and they're builders of
archetypal structure.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that theirs is to
translate into physical terms

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:90%
or human terms star knowledge.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And wisdom is wisdom
regardless of form.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:55.957 align:middle line:90%
So its cat wisdom.

00:52:55.957 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:84%
If you starting thinking
of the Egyptian pantheon,

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.950 align:middle line:84%
you start understanding,
yes, that the cat wisdom

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:05.210 align:middle line:84%
is what is so important-- is the
feline consciousness, meaning

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:07.390 align:middle line:90%
the pre-separation.

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is a quality, I think,
from an acting point of view,

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:10.970 align:middle line:90%
to feel that.

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a different perception.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand this is
the fertile ground from which

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
the implantation of the
star seeds grow, in a way,

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.880 align:middle line:84%
like an arc across the
ages, saying that once you

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.230 align:middle line:84%
see the translation is
not in the outward form,

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:30.333 align:middle line:84%
but it signifies a
greater condition,

00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:84%
do you see that it's
almost, if you say,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadian stars
fall to Earth.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:84%
We rise out of that
context realizing

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that that's what's leavening
our archetypal structure.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It's saying you grow from
a star system structure.

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:43.760 align:middle line:90%
You're not unique.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You are part of this Septenary
consciousness of, you'd say,

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the four elements or in the
higher mind, soul, and spirit.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:53.978 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand
this, in a way,

00:53:53.978 --> 00:53:55.520 align:middle line:84%
this is why the
divine teachers come,

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE],, the Hermes,
meaning that first we precede

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.870 align:middle line:84%
by saying these are the golden
templates, because you're

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.457 align:middle line:90%
establishing a foundation.

00:54:04.457 --> 00:54:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the importance
of the Pleiadians.

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.165 align:middle line:84%
I really do think that
they're trying to say,

00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:13.720 align:middle line:84%
if you want to know who you
are, turn away from the optics.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Turn to the resonance.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Trust the stars not
outside of yourself,

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.790 align:middle line:84%
but take that
imaginative journey

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and allow that energy to rise
as this perception of, yes, I

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.840 align:middle line:84%
am woven of these
archetypal lenses that

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.900 align:middle line:84%
are set in motion by our
quality of our greater

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.310 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that realizes
it's not to go there, as I said,

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:84%
because we wouldn't
really understand it.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Think about time as being
a condition, a container.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you're out
of sequence, you're

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.302 align:middle line:84%
going to get parts but not
be able to put it together.

00:54:45.302 --> 00:54:47.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what's interesting
to think about,

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that actually we're
trying to create coherence

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
by gathering the story
back into this condition.

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
their great goal was--

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to take the Hermetic journey
of "as above, so below"

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.350 align:middle line:84%
through the symbolical
structure to finally bring it

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to a human coordinate
point where we literally

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:09.572 align:middle line:84%
hold the star system
in our intimate space.

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I think the
greater language of wisdom

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.673 align:middle line:84%
would say, yes, that's
when we can commune,

00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:16.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
trying to come to us.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You no longer think
of us in time,

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but like this-- a greater
dome in which you are held.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And once you trust
it more and more,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
it again becomes that which
releases our resistance.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We're all holding different
parts of the treasure map,

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.740 align:middle line:84%
essentially, trying to put
it together where, in a way,

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.670 align:middle line:84%
it creates a deep enough lense
where it itself has found a way

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to transmute its own energy,
to humanize its expression,

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.330 align:middle line:90%
where we're able to embrace.

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a
shifting of energy.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that a lot of
what this is trying to-- if you

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.550 align:middle line:90%
think of the hand like the bud.

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:59.902 align:middle line:84%
And we're really bound by
these different qualities.

00:55:59.902 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, five
different races, right?

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Like the fingers.

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So the contraction is that first
we must grasp, like the bud.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But once we trust
that we're woven

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.290 align:middle line:84%
of these different
relationships,

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:16.130 align:middle line:84%
then we begin to
open and to blossom.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about the
old condition of this,

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's the, in a way,
the emerging condition of,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:90%
oh, I realize I must breathe.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, that
it's saying that once

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:31.280 align:middle line:84%
we understand that it is
about breath, about breathing,

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and about, in a sense,
disenchanting ourselves

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:84%
from being about time,
but rather this larger

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.380 align:middle line:84%
cumulative awareness
that for ages upon ages

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.800 align:middle line:84%
has been laying the ground
for us, for our time,

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to really blossom as
the human form divine,

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to understand that the great
gift is that we are each an art

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.478 align:middle line:90%
form of consciousness.

00:56:54.478 --> 00:56:55.520 align:middle line:90%
We're not born into time.

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.650 align:middle line:90%
We're born into creation.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So the question of
the, again, races

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:06.950 align:middle line:84%
become if the Arcturians are,
in a way, the entire story,

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleiadians
are the ones that

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.380 align:middle line:84%
implement the story,
what's the next race?

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, let's go the opposite
end of the spectrum and go

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:21.130 align:middle line:10%
into the Zeta Reticuli,
which are coming from--

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:10%
according to Lisa's
channelings--

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:10%
the Zeta would be the
opposite in the spectrum

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:32.810 align:middle line:10%
of the Pleiadians, coming
from the Vega lineage, which

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:37.370 align:middle line:10%
is associated with the
serpent, and then that

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:10%
funnels into the Serius lineage,
which is more, again, serpent.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
it the dark star,

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Anubis coming from Sirius.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But really, the-- so before
we go into the Sirius

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.520 align:middle line:84%
in the next block,
but Zeta as being

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.110 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite end
of the spectrum--

00:57:54.110 --> 00:58:01.490 align:middle line:84%
these beings that are very
masculine, very logic,

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Spock in "Star Trek."

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But even further into
that, sort of almost robotic,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.120 align:middle line:90%
very hive mind consciousness.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And we know from all of the
abduction cases in Whitley,

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and all of these other things
that these beings, there's

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.310 align:middle line:84%
sort of a lore story
that they lost their--

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:84%
they're sort of
a clone race that

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:34.310 align:middle line:84%
went so far into
their evolution where

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.010 align:middle line:90%
they destroyed their planet.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They over masculinized
their whole experience

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.160 align:middle line:84%
in pollution, nuclear weapons,
and all these sort of things.

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So they had to go into
hiding underground.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And they lost their
ability to reproduce.

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.410 align:middle line:90%
So they cloned.

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And they just started
creating copies,

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:58.700 align:middle line:84%
over copies, over copies,
eventually degrading into not

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:90%
being able to reproduce at all.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:04.108 align:middle line:90%
And technology failed them.

00:59:04.108 --> 00:59:06.013 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
one of many stories.

00:59:06.013 --> 00:59:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sort of sticking
with this one, because most

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.370 align:middle line:84%
of my audience sort
of knows this story.

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's come up several times.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
continue life, they

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:22.020 align:middle line:84%
had to come into our
space-time continuum,

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and made sort of a
soul contract with us

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:30.330 align:middle line:84%
prior to our incarnations
here to take our DNA

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:32.370 align:middle line:84%
so they could hybridize
with the humans,

00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:35.340 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
close DNA match there,

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and then create
these hybrid beings.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If we look at each of
these qualities as players

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.670 align:middle line:90%
in a greater play.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Her chart's very helpful,
because you'll see from these

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:52.470 align:middle line:84%
greater universal principles,
Sirius and Orion, really Newt.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have also then the
relationship of Orion with Geb.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually what
the hieroglyph behind you

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.720 align:middle line:84%
is, which I redrew,
because I was

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.900 align:middle line:84%
very interested in this
relationship of Sirius, the dog

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.890 align:middle line:90%
star.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And then Orion being the
relationship, of course,

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of the quality of the
masculine and feminine,

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.980 align:middle line:84%
this great relationship
of the king and queen,

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and that she becomes
the vault of heaven.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.280 align:middle line:90%
In a sense you'd say the one.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.140 align:middle line:90%
That rises.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And even she has
an invisible star.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But this great queen of heaven
becomes the vault within which,

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
or the womb within which
human conditions, in a sense,

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.920 align:middle line:90%
the maters can arise.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And in this condition, a
bit like Isis and Osiris--

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
they're really the turning
down of these two energies

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
into the form that
help us understand

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that the question was coming in
through these god qualities of,

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
again, how do we take star
knowledge, this knowledge

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, the
knowledge of Sirius.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And even the
Egyptians say, we came

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
from the land of the watchers,
that in the ancient ones,

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that Osiris and
Isis aren't figures

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of symbolical representation.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They're actual beings that come.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
texts from theosophy,

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
from the study of
the secret doctrine,

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
you learn about how there really
is this call from different

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH],, as they're
called, or spheres,

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
meaning that essentially
we're going to have qualities

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.197 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that all
donate, in one way or another,

01:01:31.197 --> 01:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
different qualities.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.947 align:middle line:84%
You'd almost say the
star system is showing up

01:01:33.947 --> 01:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
into a grand stew
of consciousness,

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
as if to say that the only way
we're going to actually compose

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
a universal being is by adding
in all of its universal,

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.210 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, ingredients.

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.627 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to have everything

01:01:46.627 --> 01:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
from a type of clone
like consciousness

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to an exalted consciousness,
because, in a way,

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that's the container, the
truth that we are all that.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that if
you think of the races

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
symbolically, as you do with
archetype and structurally,

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.460 align:middle line:84%
you begin to honor
the fact that to know

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
why these conditions are as
they are, languaged as species

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, is to say
that you really are dealing

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
with living qualities.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I learned this with the
archetypes in the Tarot,

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
because often you
look at these things

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I'm
just making it up.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But the deeper you go, you
realize, this is making me up.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:27.235 --> 01:02:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why I feel like
a lot of this knowledge is not

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
trying to overwhelm.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Because think of trying to
slowly dissolve resistance so

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.340 align:middle line:84%
this greater knowledge doesn't
distract, doesn't disconnect.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But finally, connects to a
deeper root system that says,

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
the reason this is
so difficult is,

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.500 align:middle line:90%
think of the wiring involved.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Of translating
multi-dimensional stories

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
in space and
consciousness, slowing

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
this down into a
temporal vehicle that

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
itself will experience
itself as an act of duration.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And then a composite that
is creating the library.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that this is
Osiris, Isis, and Sirius,

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and Orion, and the Pleiadian,
all of these effects,

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
if we think of them
as actors in harmony,

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
meaning that because
we're creating

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
a holographic being,
a universal being,

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
I will hold the Pleiadian.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.373 align:middle line:90%
You will hold the Sirian.

01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:21.540 align:middle line:90%
You will hold the Arcturian.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And you almost think
of a jazz ensemble.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:27.143 align:middle line:84%
And we'll put the universe
together brilliantly.

01:03:27.143 --> 01:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because there will
be no mistakes.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll lean into those things and
figure out just how wonderful

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:32.330 align:middle line:90%
it is than we thought.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.130 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Think of that as a
greater creative ideal,

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it's willingness to
endure its own darkness,

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
because it gets this
sense that behind that is

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.460 align:middle line:90%
a calling toward.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I almost feel
like if people deal

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
with the relationships
and the channelings

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
intimately, not as
a scientific proof,

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
but more of a creative,
intimate relationship that says,

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to, in a sense,
turn you into a debater.

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.763 align:middle line:90%
Don't use me to prove something.

01:03:57.763 --> 01:03:58.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:58.563 --> 01:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Think of me as a love affair.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Think of me what you actually
hide, you keep private,

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.177 align:middle line:84%
until you find those that
share these qualities.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what I think
of a lot of the martial art

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
here is saying that we've
come from a time of building

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
a self that was always in
a world that didn't care

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and we were always up against,
and that, finally, it's

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.080 align:middle line:84%
turning us back toward
one another, and saying,

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
oh, I see in you the human
struggle that I see in me.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But I see the
artistry behind it not

01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
as it was to solve something,
but to resolve a greater quest

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.920 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't getting it right.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense always,
if you think about it,

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
by degree trying to reveal
there's a deeper beauty.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But in every human
story it's that we

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
earn that beauty, which is, of
course, the grail story here.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like your home.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't get out
of responsibility

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
when you're home.

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And you don't use
creativity to escape.

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And you don't use the stories
of aliens to not be present.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is why.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.918 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times
we put on errors.

01:04:59.918 --> 01:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like everything
has brought us to our knees,

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
going don't use me as
anything other than that

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%
which inspires you to remember.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You are worthy of a
universal relationship,

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
but that that universal
relationship is in your heart.

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And that will feed
your dreams, which

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
will change the view
of the world, which

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
will, of course, transform
the world for all of us.

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:32.590 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you see Newt up
here on the ceiling?

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.795 align:middle line:90%
Can you see her?

01:05:35.795 --> 01:05:36.595 align:middle line:90%
On the I-Beam?

01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:38.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:42.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this is the story
of Newt and Geb retold,

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.960 align:middle line:10%
unexpectedly.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.790 align:middle line:10%
But we're going to
see how she comes up

01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:48.760 align:middle line:10%
from the floor, and
vaults over the ceiling.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And we see her
face on the I-Beam.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be symbolically
more delighted than that.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120 align:middle line:90%
How do you see her face?

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, I beam.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
When you beam,
you see, you open.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.990 align:middle line:90%
You smile.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
roof holds itself.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
But it lifts as high as it can.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.925 align:middle line:90%
And that's the vaulted Newt.

01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> This would be the
Sirian energy here.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And do you see how
her womb is the light?

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Her heart is the infant?

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Her journey is the
egg, the heron,

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and the shell, this great
arc of human consciousness?

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
see the serpent.

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You see the blind serpent
as her belly button,

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.953 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the
serpent of evolution

01:06:26.953 --> 01:06:27.870 align:middle line:90%
is this great journey.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.287 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you
can follow this.

01:06:29.287 --> 01:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It flows all the
way around the roof,

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
over to that egg above
the chalice, as if to say

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
we're finally in this
greater signature of things,

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that Newt above shows us
that the journey begins

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
in innocence, and that we take
a journey across the ages.

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Because as we come
down, we're going

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to see this great relationship
that as one stands here,

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
we become a watcher,
meaning we do not

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
see our face or our reflection.

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:03.580 align:middle line:90%
We see ourselves as essence.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And this whole journey, this
dance is that we try to return,

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
but we can't.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so in this room, we set
the wheel of time and eternity

01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
in motion.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
We go downstairs into the
structure, into the archetypes.

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And we will go
into the domestic,

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
meaning how do we do this?

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.420 align:middle line:90%
How do we live?

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And finally, here we will come
back up into the structure.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, as a type
of immersive theater,

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
because as one
steps here, this is

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
where we see the revelation
of the Tarot as a structure,

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.977 align:middle line:90%
as an operating system.

01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:37.935 align:middle line:90%
You can see the square.

01:07:37.935 --> 01:07:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you see the foundation?

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And the wheel, just as in
the square and the circle.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But here we're going to see this
relationship like a gyroscope,

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that once we set the wheel in
motion, it creates balance.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.430 align:middle line:10%
The foundation is
not which character

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.290 align:middle line:10%
do we believe in
or not believe in,

01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:57.630 align:middle line:10%
but they create like a piano,
the structure that holds us.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we tilt up this way,
this story that takes us

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.510 align:middle line:90%
into the story of a ascension.

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And we see [INAUDIBLE]
and Thoth and Ra,

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and Nagas, meaning
all of this journey--

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and down here we can
see the pyramids,

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.350 align:middle line:90%
the story of the Romans.

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that we're
going to go across the ages,

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:18.745 align:middle line:84%
asking over and over again,
what does it mean to be human?

01:08:18.745 --> 01:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And what is
extraordinary is here

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we see, essentially, that
ever vanishing window point.

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But we start to
see this Christos,

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.890 align:middle line:84%
this story of the light of mind,
that finally does not anchor.

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the
pillars on the ground?

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.580 align:middle line:10%
It's that the light of mind
opens this other quality

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.410 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
If we think
physiologically, this

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
is actually a manifestation of,
we enter the world this way.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We stand up into this so that
we go into these two eyes,

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.779 align:middle line:90%
duality.

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But once we achieve the
balance of these things

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:53.840 align:middle line:90%
to see it's to do this.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.899 align:middle line:84%
It's to hold the
greater eye of wonder

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.814 align:middle line:84%
in the balance of
form and structure.

01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:00.439 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit like
saying, it's finally

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
the piano holds the music.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:26.000 align:middle line:90%
