00:00:03.486 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Greetings to Reuben.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:90%
This is Aridif.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Greetings.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Hello there.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Good to talk to you again.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It is a very great
pleasure to speak to you

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
in these moments again,
understanding above all things

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
that you are loved.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that you have
many queries in this day.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:90%
You may begin at your leisure.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to have a
really good understanding

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and explanation, at
least in my terminology

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding and
others, to resonate with

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
your explanation of kind
of how the universe works,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
different states
of consciousness.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of wanted to go
into that arena with you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
today for the audience
as well, if that's OK.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It is of utmost
excitement to be here

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
with you to co-create any
understandings you further

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:90%
wish to reflect.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The universal construct
is one of our favorite

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate into
teachings as we know

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Rob enjoyes it highly also.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we just spoke with Rob.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.218 align:middle line:84%
And he was explaining the
different terminologies of--

00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
or at least his perspective
and his understanding

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
of densities and dimensions.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be a common
theme used from our higher

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
density, higher dimensional
friends, beings,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
who tend to come in and share
these amazing messages with us.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can start there
with this idea of ascending

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.955 align:middle line:84%
That's a common
theme, a common topic.

00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the main theme
of my series at the moment.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And would you like to
comment a little bit

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
about the fifth dimension?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And what does that mean
from your perspective?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And how do you see
the human collective

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
integrating and evolving
into this fifth dimensional

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, to define
fifth density consciousness,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
or fifth dimensional more so,
to express what Rob has already

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
placed within in front of
you is an apt description.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But we wish to
express what it is we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
perceive within our own view.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
As we are looking
into consciousness,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
the way it integrates from your
higher fractal consciousness

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to lower fractal
consciousness, this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is the sliding of consciousness
in scale that we see

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and how we define
this measurement.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
When you are perceiving,
your own consciousness

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
being a larger portion and
integrating small portions

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
in your growth, this
shows you expansion.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It shows you manifestations
of growth, manifestations

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
of the ability to manifest.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things show
you this great opportunity

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
to expand and to grow.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the fifth
dimensional consciousness,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
this is where growth
takes leap and bounds.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
In your previous
evolution as humans,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
you have experienced a
great deal of many things.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You experience a short
lifetime in your very earliest

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of human years because there
was nothing for a human

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:90%
to do but live and exist.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:90%
To eat, to hunt, to gather.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Then as you continue to grow,
the age of your physical bodies

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:90%
expanded.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And they expand for the reason
of the experience needed.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, to speak of
these terms, we must

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
understand the concept of what
evolution in physical variety

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Your physical bodies are a
part of your non-physical self

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
manifested for
experience sake alone.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So you are here
only to experience.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of you believe
that there is

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
a big thing that must be done
or a large journey or a purpose.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Or my mission is
a word often used

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to come to Earth is to free
the minds of all things.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
That is acceptable.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
That is great if that is
what you decide to do.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But the over soul sent you
in the first place only

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to experience and
gather experiences.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So as your human evolution
goes, your growth in age

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
shows you what you have to
experience in your existence.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
With an average span
of hundred years

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
at the most for most
humans these days,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
this is a part of
the evolution that

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
has grown exponentially before.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And you see your 40
years and 50 years.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Now you are at 100.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
100, a great number,
nicely rounded

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to experience a greatly
rounded experience.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you are in fourth
density consciousness.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You are in fifth
dimensional consciousness.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a great leap and bound.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Most of you are not aware of
the leap that you have made.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Most of you are not
aware of the growth

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
that you have experienced.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So what you still
experience is much of what

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
you did in your fourth density
predecessor, third density.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You experience a
lifespan of 100 years.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
You experience death,
pain, all of these things.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But in the fifth dimensional
process and the fourth density

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
process, what you
are experiencing

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is expansion beyond a point
that you would recognize

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
yourself to be as human.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we define this
with the scale of consciousness

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%
integration.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
When you are experiencing an
integration of consciousness

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
from higher fractal
consciousness to the lower

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
fractal consciousness, your
fifth dimensional shift

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
brings you a great deal more.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the majority of
human beings living in earth

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
experience 10% of
their overall essence,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
what you defined previously as
lower fractal consciousness.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
As you grow and expand, that is
up to 20%, perhaps 22.5% or 25%

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
for the very highest
of conscious beings

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:90%
upon your planet.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you begin to embrace
the fifth dimensional self

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that you are, that will
jump quite largely.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It will be in the
areas of up to 35%.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:84%
This means that all
of what you are you

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
can now experience
up to 35% of it.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:84%
If you experience 100%,
for reference sake,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
of your overall
essence, you would

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
be at the end of sixth density.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:90%
You would be unlimited.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:84%
You would be able to
transport your physical body

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
not only from place to place
in the physical universe,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
but also into different
levels of reality,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
different matrices,
different points of reference

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
are not understood

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to be points of reference
in this reality alone.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:90%
That raises some questions.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
the lifespan, if we

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
were to use 100% of
our consciousness,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
what would the
estimated lifespan be?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Would we not even have
a lifespan anymore?

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
How would that work?

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:84%
How many years in
Earth years terms

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:90%
would we end up living to?

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth density experience,
there is no life and death.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It is incarnation and
leaving the physical body.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:90%
These are two different terms.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
Now you are in a system where
by natural cause, you are born,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
you age, time becomes
linear, and then you die.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
In our experience,
there are races

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have come
into contact with that

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
are in the sixth density
consciousness that

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
can live for hundreds of
thousands of your earth years.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And just to even
back up further,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
so you are a sixth
density being?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Sixth dimensional
or seventh dimensional?

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
How would you define that?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are looking in
dimensions themselves,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
we are sixth
dimensional entities.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for a human
in the third density,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
fourth density
consciousness and, say,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
be born in third density
and then expand and evolve

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
within that density's
consciousness all the way up

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
until the sixth density within
one lifetime, so to say?

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Has that ever happened?

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.333 align:middle line:90%
Has that been done before?

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That has never been done
within this universal construct

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a natural form
of evolution that comes.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
When you are born
in a third density

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and arise to the fourth density,
most entities upon most planets

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that are much less resistant
than the human consciousness,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
the integration
of consciousness,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
end up only exploring the
first fifth percentile

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth density, which
can be very expansive compared

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
to your realities
in third density.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
For instance, humans
experience the lack of ability

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to heal one's self with thought
alone on a shorter term.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
The ability to manifest
what you desire

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
within a very timely cost
or a short timely cost.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So you are experiencing
manifestations

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that in some of your experiences
take years to experience.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Healing that can be done
over months or years.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth
percentile for density,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
you can instantly manifest
healing to your physical body.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
You are able to
manifest something

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
within minutes, hours, or even
if you are very good at it,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:84%
you are able to manifest things
at almost an instant rate

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or instant by comparison to
your terms of instantaneous.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have had beings
and records of beings

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
on our planet--

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
for example Jesus or Buddha
or even Muhammad-- who have

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
had these great powers, these
great abilities to manifest,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:90%
to do things.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:84%
What density would you
classify these beings in?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And did they start
off in third density

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and then they evolve into,
say, fourth or fifth density

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
within this planetary
constraints, I guess?

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
How would you define
them in a density?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In all of those cases, they
do come from a higher density.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Most of them fall,
with exception

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
of some entities that have
been your teachers coming

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
from fifth.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
But that is their consciousness.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
When they are born
onto the Earth planet

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
into a physical body, they are,
for all intents and purposes,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%
third density beings.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing of
Jesus or Muhammad or Krishna

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
or all of these entities that
you experience as third density

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
guards or teachers or the
greatest of magicians,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
for some of your
mindsets, these entities

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
showed you the prowess
of third density beings.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
These entities showed you a
peek into the fourth density

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:84%
This is why they seem to be
such extraordinary energies.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:84%
They integrated more portions
of their own higher fractal

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
consciousness into their
physical reality of the lower

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
fractal consciousness
and showed you

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
what instantaneous
manifestation could be.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, what most humans are not
understanding about this point

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is that in that
moment, all of you

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
could have done what Jesus
was doing had it not been

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
for the collective resistance.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can do
everything that Jesus once

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
did now in this moment.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But because of your
beliefs and resistance,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
it is very infrequent
that this occurs.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And so in essence,
that collective belief

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is sort of what's keeping this
collective reality intact.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So if someone were to sort
of stand out and evolve

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
into fourth or fifth
density consciousness

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and the collective
hasn't gotten there,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
would they just leave
this reality altogether?

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Would they die or ascend,
so to say, separately

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:90%
from the collective?

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Let us ask you one question.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
In your biblical terms, in
your own terms of history,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
what happened to Jesus?

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
He was not well accepted.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, the
collective consciousness

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
has a way to flush
those energies out.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus was not with you in
the fourth density time period.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
You are now all entering
and have entered quite well

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.050 align:middle line:90%
the fourth density.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Entering comes in the
points of perception.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Once an entity manifest
themselves fully

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
into that fourth
density consciousness,

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
integrates more portion of the
higher fractal consciousness,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
they will start to experience
the greater experience,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
be damned if any others
agree or do not agree.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
That is not the question
here in fourth density.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.277 align:middle line:84%
No matter what, nothing can
stop the individual's evolution

00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:90%
is basically what you're saying.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing will stop that.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And even in your experiences
pre-fourth density,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
third density entities were
able to tap into the highest

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
portions of themselves.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
This is partially to do
with the human connection

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
to all densities above.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So this greater ascension
of humanity is basically,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
in other words-- and no
offense to anybody out there--

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
but we're all becoming Jesus.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all kind of
ascending like Jesus

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:84%
did in his consciousness
and his awareness.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking at the
concept of Christ himself,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
many terms have been come
across the years of you deemed

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.148 align:middle line:84%
to be something similar
to Christ consciousness.

00:14:48.148 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So the Christ consciousness.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So many people, the
second coming of Christ--

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
they use this term the
second coming of Christ--

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.485 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
mean the individual

00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
being is going to
show up on the planet

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
and save the day, so to say.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's a collective
consciousness of humanity

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
is entering into this.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Is that fair to
say in those terms

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that we all as a collective is
the second coming of Christ?

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> In that essence, when you are
looking at the terms of second

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:90%
coming of Jesus or Christ, yes.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
are speaking of.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the reintegration of your
abilities to be as Jesus was.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But in the term
Christ consciousness,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
this is something
a bit different.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There are collective groups
of higher density beings that

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.180 align:middle line:84%
interact with all
planet all the time.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We are one entity within a
larger group of energies that

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
co-create certain
experiences with humans.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Your Christ consciousness
was a manifestation

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
of a collective
consciousness in order

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to help directly humans
understand their potential

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to be as I am, but
to be much more.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
These similar words
spouted from the Bible.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But it is a
representation of what

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
the Christ consciousness is.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
We will show you what
you are capable of.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
We will show you that if
you desire the greatest

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
of expansion, you may have it.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Christ
consciousness is.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, looking
into the Christ consciousness,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it is not fair to deem
it the Christ consciousness.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Many great entities came
from this consciousness

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:90%
through your collective.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was one of them.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
As you have expressed,
Buddha, Krishna, Muhammad,

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
all of these great teachers who
have showed you both miracles

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest way of thought
process and the greatest

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
way of heart, those
entities come directly

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
from this collective
consciousness.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, like
in the past, we've

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
had channelings from
the Pleiadian Collective

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
or Arcturian energies,
Arcturian collectives,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
this collective consciousness
similar to our ET

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It's its own kind
of consciousness.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not necessarily from
the Pleiadian star system,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
but it's its own kind
of collective beings

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:90%
who carry this frequency.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:90%
This is a very fair term.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But to expand perhaps
a small part of that,

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
a collective is
any entities that

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
are in a co-creative effort.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
And by co-creative
effort, what we mean,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
their excitement
excitements align

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
through synchronicities of
being able to join their energy

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:90%
for one common purpose.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:90%
So what we are saying--

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:84%
for example, 100 entities spread
throughout 1,000 star systems

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
come to the forefront to express
we desire to help humanity.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
We desire to help
earth and humans

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
in the planetary consciousness
with whatever means possible.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, their physical
bodies may join

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
in one area for a meeting
or a group connection.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, their
collective consciousness

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:90%
is much greater than this.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Their collective is the
essence and the sum total

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of all of their fractal
consciousnesses combined.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They are able to
think a thought.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
They are able to think a
purpose for a better scenario

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to connect with humans
and create such a scenario

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:90%
through instant manifestations.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
This means that in your
Jesus landing where Jesus

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
came to your planet, that Christ
collective consciousness desire

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to show you through example
in the area of Jerusalem,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
in the area of Israel,
to show those people

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
through their own beliefs of
the ancient Hebrew Bible of what

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
was possible and how to
reconnect a different mindset

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.450 align:middle line:84%
through a population that
was controlled through fear.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So they manifest the physical
incarnation of Jesus.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It was not one entity that
said I will come into Earth

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and be this entity.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the collective
consciousness's thought

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
process, their co-create
of excitement that helped

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:84%
formed an energy that
came into an incarnation

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:90%
to be a human being.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're on this
term of collective.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a good way
to kind of define and explain

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
this to our audience.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Would it be safe to say we have
the United States of America,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
nations, countries, religions.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Would each one of
these belief systems,

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
each one of these nations,
have their own consciousnesses,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
their own collectives that
would together work and have

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:90%
its own essence, to say?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
This is quite akin to
what we are speaking of.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking at
the division and lines

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of common interests,
this is completely

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
resonant with the idea.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost like we've
had in the past.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Football teams that
get very out of hand,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and then they start
to riot almost.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Or even when we
had the LA riots.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is almost because
one individual starts it,

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
but then the whole thing
gets out of control.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is sort of
the kind of tapping

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:84%
into this collective
energy, that it spreads

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:90%
throughout the hive, so to say?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that another way to say it?

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Is that sort of a collective
consciousness for ball teams?

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that a collective?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything that comes
for a common purpose.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you are speaking
of where one entity expresses

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
something and whether an
entity thinks it or feels it,

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
this are covering
two concepts that we

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
would call the hive mind, but
also the 100th monkey effect.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Both of those are very akin
to what you are speaking up.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
But anything can be a
collective consciousness.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yourself, Rob, and Kalina
in this area, in this day,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
are the interview with
extra dimensional collective

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:90%
consciousness for this moment.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
All who listen afterwards join
the collective, et cetera.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And so in essence--

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:90%
this is what I was getting.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So myself, Rob, and Kalina
gathering together here,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of making an
energetic baby, so to say,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
with the three of us unionized.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
energy that's created,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:90%
this collective of the three.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And though it may
not manifest itself

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
in a physical sort of baby
[LAUGHS] we can hold in cradle,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
but that energy is
there, that essence.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is its own collective.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Is that is that OK to say?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Energetic baby to define
these collective consciousness

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:90%
is more of an energy?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Energetics are a part of it.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The thought process
is a part of it.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Energy of excitement
is part of it.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Intent also a part.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:90%
There are many facets.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But yes, this is a
very good definition

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:90%
of the collective consciousness.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.182 align:middle line:84%
Well, moving along, in
definitions it seems to be--

00:22:07.182 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
definition episode [LAUGHS]

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:90%
of extra dimensionals.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
timelines and grids.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think these are also
two terms that come up a lot.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And multiple timelines,
multiple universes.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain to myself and
to the audience your perception

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:90%
on how we can so easily--

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
it's been told to us from
other extra dimensionals--

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're constantly
shifting timelines

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:90%
from one timeline to the next?

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know individually,
we're recreating ourselves

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
in every moment, billions of
potentials and possibilities

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and synchronicities
coming together.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But can you explain maybe
on the individual level

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
as well as on the
collective level how

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:90%
these timeline shifts--

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
how we can so easily shift
from one to the other?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
mechanisms behind all this?

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we must place
this in an orientation for all

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that there
is no timeline specifically

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
or no finite area
of space in which

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:90%
is defined and permanent--

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
all things exist
within the now--

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and want to grasp that
concept, it is much easier

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to express the
further of timelines

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
or concrete mechanisms
in use of timeline.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So let us first address
what is a timeline?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
A timeline defined
by most entities

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
are what can occur along
an energy if not changed.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
If its pathway is not changed,
then that line is more forward.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But to express it in
a more simple route,

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:90%
let us express it in this way.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
There are probabilities of
all things at all times.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Any entity upon your
own planet or any entity

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
within this universe
has an infinite amounts

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of probabilities that they
can do in each moment.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
timelines of earth have

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
experiences where all
entities will evolve

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
into another entity or another
consciousness altogether,

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
something you would see
as extraterrestrial.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
There are timelines in where
all Earth humans stay upon earth

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and stay in the collective
consciousness of Earth.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
probabilities,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:90%
and that's what timelines are.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
They are probabilities
that have not had energy

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:90%
placed or focused into them.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So basically potentials.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Timelines are just
potential realities.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are infinite
amounts of potential realities.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we understand
that many of you

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
see timelines to be
finite or see timelines--

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
most of you have called Akashic
records a finite timeline.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:90%
This is what I am here to do.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:90%
This is my pathway.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So in our perceptions,
any probability

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of any action or
mindset will cause

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you to go in another
vibrational direction.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we would see
as changing your timeline.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Any vibrational dictation of
thought, belief, or actions

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
can place you into another
area or timeline altogether.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But in our
terminology, we prefer

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to call this shifting
through your twin soul.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a concept that
shows the mechanism of how

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:90%
you choose your reality.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So I see.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I kind of--

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I just got a glimpse of--

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been using
this analogy of late

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of a drop of water in the ocean,
let's say the human experience

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
being the individual
drop of water.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But we're in this vast ocean
of infinite possibilities.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So we are still the
ocean when we're

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
a drop of water in the
ocean, but we're still

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:90%
the individual drop of water.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And can I use this analogy?

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I guess I just saw it.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Can I use this
analogy as the ocean

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
being the infinite possibilities
that already exist?

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And this drop of water can
just navigate through the ocean

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
as depending on
where it wants to go,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
depending on its
choices, its actions?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:90%
This is very resonant.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The concept and idea of
choosing one portion of reality

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
through a means or desire
amongst the infinite

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
amounts around them.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything that has
happened, could happen,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and did happen is all in
this ocean of potentialities.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
That's essentially a timeline?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has happened, will
happen, or is happening now.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is it possible to
have more than one timeline?

00:27:08.373 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, there's
many different timelines.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But all timelines I guess exist
in this infinite potential

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:90%
of ocean.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you speaking of the concept
of experiencing two timelines

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:90%
at once?

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I wasn't
thinking about that.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But let's explore that idea.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to go there.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.682 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:27:29.682 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And how does that work?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It has occurred on all planets
since the beginning of mankind.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Most of you call this
multiple personality disorder,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenia, where an entity
changes the whole persona

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
within themselves, and
often several times.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
When an entity that
you see as mentally ill

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
expresses that their
personalities then

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
take on names and identities,
and each one of them

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.385 align:middle line:84%
are quite independently
different from the other.

00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:84%
[CLEARS THROAT] When you
are looking specifically

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
at certain examples that have
been given through your media,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:84%
but also through
history, you see

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that there was one
woman who existed

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
on your planet who did artwork.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And each entity or each
specific persona within her

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
did an art that was so vastly
different that professionals

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
who look and
critique art were not

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
able to tell that it
came from the same woman.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
So is this a mental thing?

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it a brain thing?

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it something of personalities
in the psyche of a human?

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And the no portion is
that this physical body

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
was given in the incarnation
to be a place where entities

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:84%
can exchange their
timelines, where they

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:90%
can run simultaneous timelines.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
This entity is
having six personas,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:84%
but it is literally
six different entities

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.500 align:middle line:84%
shifting their perceptions,
going backwards and forwards

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:90%
from one to the other.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.375 align:middle line:84%
Often it occurs to people who
do not have this condition

00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and they are not
even aware of this.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They go by a road that they
have driven down 1,000 times

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and say there is something
in this road I have never

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:90%
seen before.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are shifting
into that reality.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And some days you see
it, some days you do not.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
It is because you
are literally jumping

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:90%
into a different reality.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
When you are thinking
of switching timelines,

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
we think it is
important to speak

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanism
with which you do.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:84%
This will allow you not
only a bit of reference,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
but also it will give
you an understanding

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of how you are able to shift
into the reality you desire.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So let us first look
at the over soul.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
We believe that Rob has given
you a great definition of this

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have touched upon this.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That is the essence of all
things in the future, past,

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and present references
of consciousness,

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
actual availability through your
higher fractal consciousness.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look
at that, there

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:84%
are 144,000 over souls
in the human Earth

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:90%
collective consciousness.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.392 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the beginning
of the Earth collective,

00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
of all collectives

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:84%
of planetary
consciousnesses that

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:84%
are inhabited by a third
density or higher beings,

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:84%
there is often the mitosis state
spawning of an entity from one

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
over soul to the next,
which is called a twin soul.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, this entity is an exact
replica of the first entity,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
but the internal mechanisms
that work are not the same.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
an over soul, that

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
has a point of reference
of consciousness

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:90%
where focus is being placed.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.430 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you yourself
have experienced this day

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
sitting across from
myself through Rob

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:90%
looking at your leg.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
That is one portion of yourself.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
That is one portion
that is being focused on

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.390 align:middle line:90%
in this moment.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Natural reality.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The places of
non-focus, the Rubens

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
who would be in other
places of this country,

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
or even in the same place
with a different portion

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of experience, those
are probabilities.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are within
the twin soul.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
That is what the twin
souls experience is for.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It is to give all
probabilities of reality

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and to place them in
order for the twin souls

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
exchange of the over souls
to the experience that

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:90%
is focused on in that moment.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So what we mean by
this is the over soul

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is desiring an experience, and
it is dictated by vibration.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It is dictated by preference of
thought, preference of belief,

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.090 align:middle line:84%
preference of actions
in each moment.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
when you yourself

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:84%
decide to have another
experience or vibration

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that you attract and
experience, then the twin soul

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.870 align:middle line:84%
gives you the new
experience to have.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It is giving you the
opportunity to exchange

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
all of the reality around
you with a new one.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And you do this literally
thousands of times per second.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
You do it millions of times
per moment and infinite amounts

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:90%
of times in your existence.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:84%
You are literally
changing realities

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:84%
of where your focus is with the
twin soul for the experience

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:90%
of focus to be experienced.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the twin soul, infinite
amounts of probabilities

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:90%
unfold.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you are
experiencing this experience

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
but you decide quickly to
reach down and touch your foot,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
the oversold knows that
that is a high probability

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:90%
that it could happen.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So those periods
of consciousness

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are set in the direct
focus of the twin soul.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It knows that there
is a high probability

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing that
within the experience,

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
putting into perhaps affect the
concept of knowing the belief

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
systems, knowing that
your action mechanisms

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that
your thoughts are

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:90%
around the area of probability.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Then in exchanging
that probability,

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:90%
it exchanges it quite easily.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It exchanges it without
hesitation or resistance.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:84%
When exchanging the harder
things, the larger things,

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
the parts that are way
outside of your normality,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
then it comes at a much further
reach for the twin soul.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:84%
We've given the
example before if you

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
place a deck of
cards in front of you

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and then place cards to
the side in both directions

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:84%
for an infinite amount,
that is similar to how

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:90%
the twin soul decides.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You yourself now, here is
the deck in front of you

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:90%
or the card in front of you.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:84%
The cards to the right and
left are only slight variances.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
dropping your camera,

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
for instance, boats
going by, for instance,

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
all things that could happen
that are fairly likely.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
are way outside, that

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
are further than both
arms lengths apart

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:84%
is where experiences that you
never thought could happen

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.850 align:middle line:84%
could happen, but your vibration
will bring them because

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of a belief system change.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
This incorporates a
tornado hitting instantly,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
a lightning bolt destroying
the area in front of you.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.719 align:middle line:84%
Not something you
would think about,

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
not something you
would desire to happen,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
not something you
believe could happen.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It is furthest away.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:84%
The twin soul will go through
and hand the over soul

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:84%
any desired expectational
or not, any experience that

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%
is in your reality that
you bring to vibrationing.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
That is the mechanism
of how probabilities

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
are pulled into your reality
and where your focus dictates.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it similar--

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
can we use the card
analogies in the idea

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution through
densities that we were speaking

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of earlier when a third density
being is using this card system

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, to go up into
a higher density to--

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
like you were saying,
it's unlikely for one card

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:84%
just to all of a sudden
be in another higher

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:84%
dimensional density
consciousness.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
You would have to evolve through
it in a card by card process.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:90%
We could use this example.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But in the essence of
your growth as a soul,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:84%
it is a much different
mechanism that is used.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The over soul dictates the
overall experience and lets

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:84%
the fractal consciousness
go free at will.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
This is where the term
free will comes into play.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So the essence of your
lower and higher fractalized

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:84%
consciousness combined is
able to do whatever it desires

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in any moment due to
the free will it gives,

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:84%
knowing that even if the fractal
does not do what it originally

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:84%
intends to do or not do what the
over soul originally intended

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it to do, it will still bring
forth a valid and important

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:84%
learning experience
for the overall.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Understand when you
experience your essence,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.630 align:middle line:84%
although you are
singular, although you

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:84%
are your own entity,
the overall over soul

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:90%
experiences it as well.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So this means every
past incarnation,

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
every future incarnation,
every parallel incarnation

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
within the twin soul will have
access to your experience.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.260 align:middle line:84%
This means that when you
finally enter the last portions

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:84%
of your sixth density
consciousness,

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and for lack of better terms,
graduate physical reality,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
rejoining the over
soul in its entirety,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:84%
you will be able to draw on all
experiences by every fractal,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
whether it has been focused
upon or not, whether it remained

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:84%
in the twin soul or whether
it came over to the over soul

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:90%
to be experienced.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's kind of where
you are with your evolutionary

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.540 align:middle line:90%
stage?

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
You've done it all?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You've
experienced it all?

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In all the different
densities up until the sixth?

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:84%
In that essence, we are not
completely done, otherwise,

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:84%
we would no longer be
in a physical body.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have not
experienced everything.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But believing that
this incarnation could

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
be one of the last
incarnations I spin, yes, this

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.160 align:middle line:90%
is quite accurate.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we move up in
consciousnesses, densities,

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.700 align:middle line:84%
awarenesses, do we
sort of get an idea--

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
like you said, you
sort of have an idea

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that this might be your last--

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:84%
how do you know it's
sort of your last one?

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Did you know going
from fourth to fifth

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:90%
or fifth or sixth densities?

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Did you kind of
know at that time

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that OK, this is probably
the last one in this density?

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Did you have that awareness?

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In the fifth density, when
graduating into the fifth

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:84%
density from fourth density,
there was an awareness that

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:84%
the lesson to be learned of
unconditional love was well

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
received, that I as a fractal
going through that experience

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.620 align:middle line:84%
knew all that I could know
about unconditional love.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt the oneness
in which I was.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
graduating postmark

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:84%
of an entity is going
through the full density

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there
was an understanding

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that it was probable,
but I did not

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
know for sure until I was
done with the fifth density.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
In the end of the fifth dynasty
joining into the sixth density,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the fractal consciousness
that I was understood well

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:84%
it was the last
incarnation and knew

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that unless there
was a great change

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in the overall collective
energy of our race

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that that would be it
for that entire day.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Knowing the same in this
incarnation that Aridif--

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:90%
that you know as Aridif--

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:84%
will be the last Denebian
or ancient Pleiadian

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:84%
incarnation and the last
physical one rejoining the over

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:90%
soul.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the truth
I understand now.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Since you brought it
up, Denebian or Pleiadian,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:90%
that is who you are.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But could you explain a
little bit about your history?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Ancient Pleiadian.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
How does that differ from maybe
some of the other Pleiadian

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:84%
consciousnesses or
beings that we've

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:90%
had visitations from already?

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Simply the term Denebian
is quite as it sounds.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We are from a star
that is called Deneb.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we are in the
consciousness of Denebian.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you are looking at
the ancient Pleiadian term,

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.130 align:middle line:90%
this is something different.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Pleiades as most of you are
aware of is a region of stars

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
within this galactic
consciousness that

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:84%
incorporate tens of
thousands or more of races.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.450 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking into
the concept of the Pleiades,

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.620 align:middle line:84%
there are humanoids,
insectoids, reptilians,

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
all varieties of entities
that you could perceive.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Our origin as a race
came from the area

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
that you call Pleiades.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
We left that star region to
inhabit a new home, one that is

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in a star that's called Deneb.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, in leaving, we
brought the entirety

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of our race to co-create a
larger energetic space for us

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.660 align:middle line:90%
to expand and to thrive.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:10%
So understanding
the ancient part

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.640 align:middle line:10%
of the words "ancient
Pleiadian" come from the concept

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:10%
that we are no longer
inhabiting the Pleiades.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Was there any
genetic manipulation

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
when you migrated
to the Deneb star?

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Or was it still
essentially the same

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.900 align:middle line:84%
as the Pleiadian energy,
the Pleiadian DNA?

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking
at Pleiadian,

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
let us confirm to you that
this is a blanket term.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.550 align:middle line:84%
When we use that word, we
are encompassing all things

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:90%
that come from Pleiadian.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that term, we
had our own DNA throughout

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
the traveling from the Pleiades
to the planet that is called

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Deneb.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:90%
But our DNA was changed.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It was not
manipulated in the way

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that another race or
ourself genetically modified

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.630 align:middle line:90%
our own DNA.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:90%
But it was changed.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And there is a reason
why DNA changes

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:40.170 align:middle line:84%
when a race moves from their
home star to a new star.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:84%
This is an incorporation
of the new race's

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
collective consciousness
with the new planetary

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.440 align:middle line:84%
consciousness also involved
in the solar system.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is expansive,
and we will stay

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:90%
to the planetary collective.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Once the planetary
consciousness integrates

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.940 align:middle line:84%
into the new collective
consciousness that is also

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
a seventh density lower
collective consciousness,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.470 align:middle line:84%
then the two energies
tend to merge.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:84%
This creates a new
energy both through DNA,

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:90%
but also in the physical body.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Our physical bodies
have remained

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:84%
intact because of our own energy
with only slight differences

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:90%
within it.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So the planet Deneb, you said
it was a seventh density planet

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.250 align:middle line:90%
at the time when you inhabit it?

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it was not a
seventh density planet.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:84%
What we were saying
about the seventh density

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is that the entirety of the new
planet in which we inhabited

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:90%
was a seventh density being.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Your Earth is a
seventh density being.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And also a collective
consciousness is a seventh

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:90%
density being.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking at
all the humans combined

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
upon your planet, every
over soul, all 144,000,

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that is what a lower
seventh density entity is.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
One over soul, lower
seventh density.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The higher seventh
density is all

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of the over souls combined
manifesting a physical planet

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.730 align:middle line:90%
into reality.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.580 align:middle line:90%
So both are called.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Both the planet and the
collective consciousness

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that we were bringing
ourselves to the planet true

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:84%
seventh density
entities combined,

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:84%
creating a new entity,
a new seventh density

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:84%
co-created collective
consciousness.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that in
mind, yourself, Aridif,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:84%
going into the seventh
density consciousness,

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
will that mean you will
have fractalized versions

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:84%
of yourself as like we are
in third density humans?

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
You will have these
kind of third density

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
fractals of yourself in the
seventh density consciousness?

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What it means for the
first moment stepping

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.030 align:middle line:84%
into the seventh
density reference point,

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:84%
what it means is I will
finally be able to achieve

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.600 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of all
things within the over soul.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Being able to perceive every
incarnation in the timeline

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
as you see linearly
passed forwards.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And now I will be able
to experience, to see,

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:90%
to feel all of those things.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But in order to fractalize
our own consciousness again,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:84%
we must start a new
incarnation cycle.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Once the seventh density
being as a over soul

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.110 align:middle line:84%
agrees to co-create with
each other over souls,

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.550 align:middle line:84%
which in our part, the highest
probable course of action

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:84%
will be that every over soul
within Denebian consciousness

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.630 align:middle line:84%
will co-create an
experience to grow

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.600 align:middle line:84%
a new planet, a new
collective consciousness,

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and start from scratch again.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So seventh density, using
Rob's analogy of consciousness,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.733 align:middle line:90%
is literally going to--

00:44:57.733 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:84%
can we use seventh
density consciousness

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.840 align:middle line:90%
as the crown chakra?

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that related in that sense?

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And once we leave
the crown, we're

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.660 align:middle line:84%
not embodied in the
physical body anymore?

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> If you use the seventh
density to co-relate with

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the seventh chakra, then
it would be in finality.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.040 align:middle line:90%
All things below combined.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything combined
in that sense.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's said there is more
dimensions past the seventh

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and going into eighth,
ninth, 10th, and even 12th,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and now recently
heard 13th dimensions.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.510 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Those are all collective
consciousnesses, I'm assuming.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when most speak of
dimensions, they are, in fact,

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:90%
truly speaking of matrices.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, matrices can be expanded.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are 12 matrices
within this universe.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Each would be perceivable
as a higher dimensional

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.160 align:middle line:84%
plane, although it is
not truly what they are.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But in the essence of densities,
there are also 13 densities.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
This is an evolution
of consciousness.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Above the physical
reality, there

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is nothing to experience
from the perspective

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:90%
of a physical entity.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It is all energetic
understanding.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It is being in a
non-physical sense.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.960 align:middle line:84%
It is experiencing connection
to all other things.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So in a density reference,
there are above seven.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Eighth, ninth, all
the way through 13.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
In dimensions,
there are literally

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.270 align:middle line:84%
only seven that are
experienceable in this matrix.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we define
matrix a little bit?

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.080 align:middle line:84%
That term also I've
heard, and I don't

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
think I have a clear definition
of when you say this matrix.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
than this matrix.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.520 align:middle line:90%
What is a matrix?

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> A matrix is a level within a
universal construct that is its

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.830 align:middle line:90%
own environment.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, understand, it is a
parallel version of something

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that is above and below it,
but it enhances connection

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to create a source energy.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So what we are saying, in
this universe, in this galaxy,

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in this specific solar
system, on this planet

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
you call Earth that
we are sitting in now,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:28.180 align:middle line:84%
what we can tell you is that
there are 12 versions of Earth,

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.980 align:middle line:90%
one in each matrix.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we understand
each matrix has

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.070 align:middle line:84%
infinite amounts
of probabilities,

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.300 align:middle line:90%
different versions.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But for all intents
and purposes,

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.630 align:middle line:84%
there are 12 direct
versions of this Earth

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of this solar system,
of all of the planets

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.690 align:middle line:84%
within this solar system, and
every portion of the galaxy

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:90%
throughout.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you are
looking at it, what

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is different in the
versions is the awareness

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of the entities within them.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The first layer of
evolution in matrix,

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:84%
the first matrix itself,
is what most of you

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
consider to be lifeless
or non cultures planets.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:84%
These are where experiences
from lower consciousnesses

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
are not able to directly
connect to create

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.140 align:middle line:90%
a source in any fashion.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They are completely
disengaged and disconnected.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The next level upwards,
there is more awareness.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Then when you are going
to the very top essence,

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the 12th matrix, this
is what most of you

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.730 align:middle line:84%
perceive as archangel
consciousness.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:84%
These are entities who
directly converse with God.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.540 align:middle line:84%
In the biblical sense,
they are connecting to God,

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.740 align:middle line:90%
speaking to God.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the truer essence, the
way we would perceive this,

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.540 align:middle line:84%
these beings are directly
communicating with creator

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.670 align:middle line:90%
energy, with source energy.

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is different
in the way that most

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:84%
see a sixth density
in this matrix

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with the
essence of all that is.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Because even our
ability to connect

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to every single consciousness
within this entire universe

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.160 align:middle line:90%
is very small in comparison.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So in this 12th matrix where the
archangel consciousnesses live,

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:84%
there is a collective
consciousness for Earth.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
archangels in your Bible,

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.940 align:middle line:84%
the entities who inhabit
Earth on the 12th matrix.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:84%
When you look out
into the universe,

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.640 align:middle line:84%
many more planets are
inhabited by different beings.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And often, these are the gods of
those planets that some of you

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.050 align:middle line:90%
hear of.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.410 align:middle line:84%
These are the entities that are
directly connected to source.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is not just beings
that are sentient in your mind.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
They are not just
beings that are aware.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They are even the
first density entities.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The first entity entities
here are rocks and stones

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.160 align:middle line:90%
and electricity.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But in the 12th matrix, those
are silver and platinum.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They are high
vibrational frequencies

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that are able to
directly connect

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to creator consciousness
and start a dialogue.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Could we relate these
matrices to this universal

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:84%
infinite potential soup, the
ocean of what some scientists

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:90%
like to call the field?

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Would the matrix be a
good term for this field?

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it can be a part of that
infinite ocean probabilities

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.400 align:middle line:90%
that you were speaking of.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But in the way, it is not
an evolutionary point.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It is a vibrational point.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So once you are
non-physical, once you

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.180 align:middle line:84%
have achieved
incarnation cycles,

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:90%
there are cycles of cycles.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the system of
the universe at whole.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.870 align:middle line:84%
It is cylindrical or
cycle oriented in nature.

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.680 align:middle line:84%
When you achieve all of the
incarnations within a matrix

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that you desire to
achieve, once you

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:84%
gain the access to be an entire
collective consciousness,

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.660 align:middle line:84%
once you have entered the
consciousness of 11th density

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
being, then you are able to
start at your new matrix.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Once you have achieved that
11th density being, or at least

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:10%
in the 10th density variety
of all things below,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:10%
feeling into your
universal consciousness,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.320 align:middle line:10%
that is when you
are able to achieve.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.360 align:middle line:10%
So it is not
something that you are

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.630 align:middle line:10%
able to say I must go
into now the next matrix

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.440 align:middle line:10%
so I will be able
to explore, at least

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.530 align:middle line:10%
not at the point of evolution
in which you are today.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.440 align:middle line:84%
For instance, an
entity as myself,

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:42.070 align:middle line:84%
one who has mastered
consciousness for better terms

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:45.860 align:middle line:84%
or for better terms
of expression,

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.280 align:middle line:84%
we have mastered
consciousness to the degree

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to
transfer our consciousness

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:90%
into another matrix.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.990 align:middle line:84%
We are only able to peek
ourselves into the next

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:90%
above and below us.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But we are not able to just run
and jump into the 12th matrix.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.650 align:middle line:84%
What we are able to
do is see experiences

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:10.180 align:middle line:84%
from a third party perspective
in matrices below and above us.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.360 align:middle line:84%
This is something that most
sixth density beings who

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.180 align:middle line:84%
are fully aware of
themselves are able to do.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But we are not able
to go into that matrix

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and experience being a part of
the collective in the matrix.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking situations
that are probably still far away

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.027 align:middle line:90%
from where humanity is going.

00:52:31.027 --> 00:52:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going to
get there eventually.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're just-- this
area where you're at,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:43.130 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be still a bit
off from the human experience.

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And let us put it very bluntly.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.790 align:middle line:10%
When you no longer
have a reference point

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:52.030 align:middle line:10%
for humanity itself
of being human

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.880 align:middle line:10%
or having a Earth
experience, that

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.540 align:middle line:10%
is when you will be able
to truly integrate yourself

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.370 align:middle line:10%
into the next matrix.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You must assimilate
all experiences

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:90%
within galactic consciousnesses.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And every single star that
has a planet around it,

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.450 align:middle line:84%
you must understand
what it is to be

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the planet, the
inhabitants of the planet,

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.270 align:middle line:84%
the star, the combined
stars for a galaxy, all

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:20.600 align:middle line:84%
of the planets and stars within,
and all galaxies throughout.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be
able to experience

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:90%
the jumping of matrix.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> When kind of--

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess it seems to
be all intertwined.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The matrices, the densities,
the dimensions, and timelines.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:84%
These are all sort of
intertwined terms and ideas

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and concepts.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.340 align:middle line:10%
Am I correct in saying that?

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.430 align:middle line:10%
>> For the most part, they
are all part of this universal

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:10%
concept.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.280 align:middle line:10%
This entity that you know as
the 11th density being that

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.530 align:middle line:10%
is the entirety
of this universe,

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:10%
they are all part
and parcel or part

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.670 align:middle line:10%
of connecting to one another.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:10%
It's all one portion
of consciousness.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.110 align:middle line:10%
So yes, in that essence, it is.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And if we're talking
about 12th density beings

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:10%
or collectives, where they're
beyond the 11th density

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.610 align:middle line:10%
universe that we have, so are
they a collective of universes?

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In common sense, that would
be an intuitive statement.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But in the way that
it works, it is not.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The 12th density is what
we would call the God brain.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.900 align:middle line:84%
For lack of better
terms, for human's sake,

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:90%
we call it the God brain.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It is the stopping
and checking point

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.770 align:middle line:84%
for all universal
consciousnesses

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to integrate with
creator consciousness, which

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:48.000 align:middle line:90%
is the 13th density.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Creator consciousness.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So once you get to
the 13th density,

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:56.260 align:middle line:84%
then you can start creating
new consciousnesses?

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite the opposite.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:84%
You are able to create
consciousness on all levels.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Even in the human mind, in
your point of evolution,

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:84%
you are creating
certain essences.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might not be
a universal essence.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But once you achieve
the integration back

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.830 align:middle line:84%
into the 11th density
being, then you

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.930 align:middle line:90%
are able to recreate it.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, even your 11th dynasty
universal consciousness

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and your perception would
be able to have a cycle.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:31.260 align:middle line:84%
This universe that you are
in, it is infinite in energy.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:90%
It is infinite in probabilities.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But what it is not
infinite in is time here.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.520 align:middle line:90%
It will exist.

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It was born.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It will die much as
the human life does.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:90%
"Dying" is such a harsh word.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.450 align:middle line:90%
We would not use that word.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:47.640 align:middle line:90%
But it is a cycle.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It incarnates, and then
it leaves its incarnation.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So the universe as
a physical entity

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.230 align:middle line:84%
will exist and not
exist at one point.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Once it stops existing,
then it has its opportunity

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to be non-physical
12th dimensional,

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.870 align:middle line:84%
or even if you are perceiving
it to be 11th density being that

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:13.390 align:middle line:84%
reconstructs itself in
a new incarnation cycle.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So it is having a cycle.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Just as your human
experience lives

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:84%
one life, dies,
has another, that

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:90%
is your reincarnation cycle.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The 11th density being
has a reincarnation cycle

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.010 align:middle line:84%
of growing, spawning,
creating a universe,

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:33.030 align:middle line:84%
collapsing, and then
starting a whole new one.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:37.385 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we talk about the
big bang in our universal--

00:56:37.385 --> 00:56:38.760 align:middle line:84%
everything known
in the universe,

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we're talking just
about this 11th density

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.620 align:middle line:90%
being known as our universe?

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And in that 11th density
being, there are 12 matrices.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
In each matrix, there are six
densities of physical beings.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are more all
the way to the 13th when

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.710 align:middle line:84%
you are looking at
numbers or perhaps

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.500 align:middle line:84%
seven equivalent
non-physical energies.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But we are not counting
creator or God brain.

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So it brings us back down to
five, mixing with the sixes,

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.230 align:middle line:84%
calls 11th energies
within each density.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is a portion
of consciousness

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that is universal in
this universe alone.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Each universal consciousness
is its own entity.

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Just as you are
experiencing your journey,

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:84%
creating film, doing all of
the things that you have done,

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.330 align:middle line:90%
each universe does the same.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Each structure within each
universe is quite different.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So you experience
a universe that

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.010 align:middle line:90%
has no physical beings upon it.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.030 align:middle line:90%
That is universe.

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It will experience
its own incarnation.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It experiences perhaps spawning
of sound vibrations and light,

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and those entities
grow and experience

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.360 align:middle line:90%
their own evolutionary cycle.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So it is not something that
is finite or everything

00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:58.920 align:middle line:90%
is the same.

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Everything is quite different.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Infinite amounts of
universal consciousnesses,

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.020 align:middle line:84%
if you take all of those,
combine them, add them

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to the 12th density being
you call a God brain, that

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.090 align:middle line:90%
is the creator consciousness.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And it is infinite,
it is ever expanding.

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.820 align:middle line:10%
There are universal
consciousnesses

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:23.040 align:middle line:10%
that are similar to this, such
as versions of Rubin and Rob

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.780 align:middle line:10%
sitting in a chair
doing something

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.230 align:middle line:10%
that is very similar that
is not within this universe.

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are universes that are
so different that there is not

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.240 align:middle line:90%
people standing.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.730 align:middle line:84%
There is not even
planets or stars.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:36.840 align:middle line:90%
There is not galaxies.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.140 align:middle line:84%
There is empty space with
musical notes jumping

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.070 align:middle line:90%
from one energy to the next.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And there is everything
that you can imagine

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:48.225 align:middle line:84%
and quite more that
is hard to imagine.

00:58:48.225 --> 00:58:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to ask that.

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered, and
it seems in our universe,

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.680 align:middle line:84%
in this particular one that we
keep interacting with higher

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.660 align:middle line:84%
dimensional beings,
there seems to be

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:03.750 align:middle line:84%
a common theme of
humanoid, bipedal entities

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that have a more expanded
heightened awareness

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and tend to go through
this evolutionary cycle.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to ask.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It seems now you kind
of answered my question.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
maybe a trademark

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:90%
of this particular universe.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is a trademark of
this universal consciousness.

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.740 align:middle line:84%
The bipedal format
is one in which

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.680 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
through the archetype

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universal construct
grows and evolves.

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are,
like you just said,

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:45.960 align:middle line:84%
other universes that don't
even have bipedal entities,

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that they may just have
vibrational sound or light

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:49.920 align:middle line:90%
or something else.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And each is so significantly
different from the next,

00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:57.270 align:middle line:84%
even if they are
completely similar,

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.420 align:middle line:84%
they are so different in the
way that things are experienced

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:05.550 align:middle line:84%
or perceived that life as
you understand it is actually

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:10.270 align:middle line:84%
quite different in experiencing
the difference between the two.

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible for us in our
universe to overlap and venture

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.580 align:middle line:10%
into some of these other
universes and worlds?

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.590 align:middle line:10%
Or is that just--

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.480 align:middle line:10%
do we have to finish this
experience and this universe

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
and then go on to
another universe?

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You must finish in
order to incorporate

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:27.930 align:middle line:90%
and directly experience that.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You must come back
into your portion

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of 11th density entity that
is universal consciousness.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But once you achieve
the non-physical state

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
above the seventh density,
when you integrate

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to eighth, ninth,
and 10th density,

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to bleed
through to the experiences

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.970 align:middle line:90%
of other things.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
You are able to perceive it
not in a first hand state,

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
but through experience
vibrational leftovers,

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.830 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you are
experiencing as a human,

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
there is ways to experience
seeing or perceiving

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the other universes,
but it must be

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%
through conscious integration.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
You as a human must first
connect your higher fraction

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:10.950 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The higher fractal
consciousness then in turn

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
connects to the over soul, the
over soul to the higher seventh

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
density version, which is the
over soul collective, then

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to your own star
system collective,

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
then to the galactic
collective, then

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to the universal collective,
then to the God brain.

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is how you must acquire
such visions or perceptions

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.060 align:middle line:90%
of other universes.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And in these other
universes, the rulebook

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.390 align:middle line:90%
could be completely different--

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I assume is completely different
than our rulebook in just

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
standard physics and gravity
and some of these basic elements

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about earlier
in first density conscious.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.208 align:middle line:90%
The elements, the metals.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of these others don't
even have any of that stuff.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
That's completely irrelevant
or is flip flopped

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, right?

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%
In that sense.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And there, again,
are many that are

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.480 align:middle line:84%
very similar to yours,
only slight tweaks

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
in the energy and rules.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But there are some that
have no same rules.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There is no gravity, no
electromagnetic force,

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
no nuclear forces
weak or strong.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
There are literally no
recognizable perceptions

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
of that universe
that you could even

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.330 align:middle line:90%
comprehend as an experience.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Let us use an example.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
One universal construct
structure in which we are aware

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is completely void
of all things.

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It does not have visible light.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:middle line:90%
It does not have visible sound.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But the way that an
evolution is experienced

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
is shifting an energy in the
feeling of layers of darkness.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, understand no
universal consciousness

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
in the entirety of all of the
universe is void of two things.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Love and light.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we say light, we are
speaking of wisdom, but also

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
physical light.

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
The darkness levels in any
entity in this universe's eyes

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
could not see into
that universe.

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But in their own perception, in
that universal consciousness,

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
being a chunk of
that dark energy

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
or a chunk of the
dark overall void,

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
you are able to see
different layers of darkness,

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
different layers
of enhancements,

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
all in the darkness
and the textures.

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:30.960 align:middle line:90%
That is the experience.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And the evolution
is how well you

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
are able to see the
differences and to experience

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.140 align:middle line:90%
the differences.

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is not done from
a physical body at all.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
It is done from
a chunk of energy

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.987 align:middle line:84%
that is something between
plasma and electromagnetism.

01:03:46.987 --> 01:03:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So being the sixth and
seventh dimensional being that

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
you are, you've peered into some
of these other universes that

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
are completely different
in their creation?

01:03:58.810 --> 01:03:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we have peered
into extraordinarily different

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
amounts of universal
consciousnesses,

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
the 11th density beings.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
But we are not able
to understand fully

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.130 align:middle line:90%
from experience.

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We are only able to see
it from an external view.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we have been able
to experience many of these.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Have humans been able
to peer into these in some

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
of our science fiction
and some of our--

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
people have different
ideas of different worlds

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Can a human go into
these worlds as well?

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Any human is able to
do so by extracting

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
the proper amount
of information,

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
by going through what
you would perceive

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
as the chain of command, going
up into their consciousness

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to the God brain energy and
being able to experience.

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But the majority
of the energy that

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
has been incorporated
into any human perception

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is at least within somewhat
of an understandable energy,

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
which means they are
accessing either things

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
from this universal
consciousness or things

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
from universal consciousnesses
which are so similar you

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
will not be able to discern.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Understanding in
this universe alone,

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
there are things that in the
human's mind scientifically

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.120 align:middle line:90%
are impossible.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They are occurring
with the same laws

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and the same universal
construct that you exist.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
within this galaxy.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
When you go to other galaxies,
their incarnation cycles

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.460 align:middle line:90%
are different.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Their expressions of what their
galaxy wishes to do as a total

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:39.060 align:middle line:90%
are different.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So it gets even
weirder from there.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of like
"Alice in Wonderland."

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you familiar
with that book?

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a good reference.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We have not read
the book ourselves,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
but we understand what
Rob has read from it.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And even some of us,
including myself,

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
have had some pretty wild
psychedelic experiences.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
When we use these
plant medicines,

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
do they take us into
some of these realities,

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.380 align:middle line:90%
into these other universes?

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Or are still more in the
universal consciousnesses

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:18.820 align:middle line:10%
of our own universe?

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, looking at
entheogens, what it does

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
is it brings you to one of
multiple different levels that

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
brings you either between
the density which you reside

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and the layer above it, which
we would call the ghost zones,

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
where humans after leaving
their physical bodies

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
tend to spend time and to evolve
until their next incarnation.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Or they are experiencing the
density directly above them.

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Very infrequently an
entheogen will take you

01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:49.770 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth density.

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But there are occurrences where
a human is evolved and expanded

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
in which it can.

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, fantastic.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take
up any more time.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I think you've enlightened
us with your words of wisdom

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and your perspectives on things.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm probably
going to have to watch

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
this 20 times (LAUGHING) to
really fully grasp it all.

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Probably even more.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But thank you again
for being here

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.338 align:middle line:90%
and everything you're doing.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And much loved.

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you also.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
It has been of our own
greatest excitement.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.700 align:middle line:90%
We bid you adieu.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
