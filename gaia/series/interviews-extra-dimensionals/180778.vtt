00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert and Jacqueline,
thank you for being here.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The main reason
why you're here is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
you say that you're hybrid
human extraterrestrial,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and you have actually
DNA that's hybridized,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and you've also had just an
amazing set of encounters

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and experiences ongoing
with different beings,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:90%
so I'd love to get into that.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And as it was talked about over
the weekend at the conference,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
seems that we're all
hybrids to some extent.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Did any of the
beings that you've

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
interacted with sort of tell
you what the basic human soup

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
genetics-- did they mention
which ones are involved?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know all of the
races that were involved.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:10%
I would think-- a
lot of people say

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:10%
there's 12 original races
that came down and started

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:10%
messing with our DNA.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:10%
It sounds right to me.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:10%
I do know that these beings
have been modifying human DNA

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:10%
since humans have been human.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:10%
They've been doing
this for thousands

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:10%
upon thousands of
years, you know?

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:10%
But as far as what
species, I'm not

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:10%
too exactly sure which ones.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.942 align:middle line:10%
Do you know which?

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I do believe
the Anunaki are key,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:10%
pretty key in terms of having
a hand with altering, or--

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.342 align:middle line:10%
I'm not quite sure
how to say that.

00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Genetically manipulating--

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:10%
>> With creating
some of the genetics.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:10%
And I was told that there is
a council of beings who kind

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:10%
of were-- they created
this experiment,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:10%
and that they all had a hand
in putting in different--

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:10%
all of their DNA
in different ways

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:10%
in terms of seeing
how that might go.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So we all could be literally
walking hybrids of different

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:90%
species, different things.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think the reason we've
been asked to step forward

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
as hybrids is we have-- this
is the way I think about it.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a much higher
frequency of star beingness

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:90%
than most other people.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are weird, or
different, or fringe,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
or however you want to
say that with our skills.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I've had wild things
happen through my life.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> During many of my interviews,
I've talked to people who are

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
sort of telepathic
or have abilities.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them say
around the age six,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I was visited by a
thing, or I saw a saucer,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.258 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be an ongoing
theme that they probably

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
already had it in them, but this
experience sort of woke them

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Activated.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Activated it.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys recall
around that age having--

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I got my implants
when I was five.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Five, OK.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
This goes to the ignorance
thing of a five-year-old.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I remember when I was--

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:90%
what is five?

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Like first grade?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Kindergarten?

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Around there?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Kindergarten.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Kindergarten?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to
the school library,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and the librarian
would be reading books

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and they would talk-- it
was a book about a kid that

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
had cancer, right?

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And the kid was talking
about how he was feeling

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:90%
these lumps in his mouth.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
just, I would say

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
a week after I heard that
book, I was feeling two lumps

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
under my tongue.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going to my
mom, mom, mom, there's lumps--

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:90%
there's lumps under my tongue.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
There's lumps under my tongue.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I got cancer.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I got cancer.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
She's like, oh, no, son, there's
lumps under everybody's tongue.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
So I just kind of like--

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I always played with them.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
They stressed out, like,
I know it's cancer.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I know it's cancer.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm feeling around
my mouth right now.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.592 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I think
I feel some lumps too.

00:05:16.592 --> 00:05:17.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right?

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:10%
But you know, I actually--

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:10%
I can grab them
and pull on them.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Even my dentist doesn't quite
really know what they are.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> One's about the
size of a little--

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
like, shaped like a teardrop.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a grain of rice, but like
a size of a grain of rice.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:10%
And then the other one's
like a little tiny ball.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.863 align:middle line:90%
>> And they flip.

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
You can flip them
around and everything.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You can flip the--

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
no, that would be freaky.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:10%
>> But yeah, so it
started at five.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Five is when I got
those implants put in.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's the implant--
those are implants.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And at that age, were they--
were you sort of aware

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and told that you
were getting implants?

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Or you were just--

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh I'm totally unaware.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Or that came later.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally unaware, yeah.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:90%
It came later.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And these are from
the mantis beings?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe so, yeah.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, speaking
of mantis beings,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I've had sort of a personal
experience recently with them.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because I haven't--

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
during all these interviews I
do with different ET collectives

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and individuals,
you know, you hear

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
about the Zeta Reticuli, the
Pleiades, the Arcturus and even

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%
reptilians.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But the mantis hadn't
really been in my radar.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this experience
with this mantis energy.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say, you know.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I identified it as the
mantis because I had seen--

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in this world, you read and
it pops up every now and then.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But it hasn't been really
explored and discussed.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd really like to sort
of get your viewpoints

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
on what are the mantis beings.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
What do they-- why
are they interacting

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:90%
with humans in this way?

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And sort of just your
personal take on that energy.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I've noticed that too when I
was starting to do my research

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
on the subject, trying to figure
out what was going on with me.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that there is
not a lot of information

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
out there about the
mantis beings at all.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is that
the mantis beings created

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%
the gray race, you know.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't hear that.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But that resonates now with
the download that I got.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I understand from
the mantis beings is that,

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
like here on Earth, there's many
praying mantis insects running

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
around, different species,
different looks, different--

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same out there.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But from what I understand
is that they were here

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:90%
at the very beginning.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were, like,
one of the first aspects

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of creation in the universe,
of physical creation.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
If you think everything is
kind of like a fractal, right,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of the whole, you
know, here on Earth,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
if you think of Earth as far
as humanity knows how evolution

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
went, you first have
your bacterial life

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and then more complex forms.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, you get
into the insects, and then

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the amphibians and
the reptiles, right?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the
conditions are harsh.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So you need that
exoskeleton at first.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So I believe-- and that's where
you're more negative mantis

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:90%
being comes from.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- the universe
is just created.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
And it's chaos.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Survival of the fittest.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --radioactive.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.855 align:middle line:84%
It's survival of the
fittest, you know,

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
so I believe that's where your
negative mantis comes from.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Then they evolve
to the next stage,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
where now, they're not
so negative, you know?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.873 align:middle line:84%
And then evolve to the next
stage, to the next stage,

00:08:51.873 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:90%
and to the next stage.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But since there
they've been evolving

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
for countless billions
of years, they

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
exist on every single
level simultaneously

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
because as we know it, time
is more circular than it

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:90%
is linear, as we experience it.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So they exist just on
every level simultaneously.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The ones that we
interact with, they've

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:84%
evolved beyond
their exoskeleton.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have the
harder shell anymore.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're extremely
benevolent and extremely loving.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.448 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they're here
interacting with Earth,

00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:90%
these are creator beings.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.445 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.445 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine,
they're so evolved

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that just one of
their consciousness

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to be
aware of everyone's

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
conscious-- every living
things' conscious on the planet.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It can literally encompass
an entire galaxy,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
whereas we can only
experience and comprehend

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:90%
these walls around us.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I can only see and
perceive what's around me.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to
perceive galaxies, you know.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
So they're just here.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I think they're just here mostly
to observe but just to help.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And alls they want to do
is help humanity evolve.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And they also want to
help create new divine

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:90%
expressions of creation.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty much
why they're here.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Jacquelin, you want to
piggyback off of that?

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've had a lot of
interaction with the mantis

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they come and
talk to me-- and also,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I do star origin
readings for people.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of the times--

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:84%
well, a number of times,
those people will be mantis.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So I get to have the
interaction with different types

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
of mantis beings.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm clairvoyant so
they show me where they're from.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I go there from
that frequency, I'll call it.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they have
shared with me is--

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I agree in that they
are very, very highly--

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
one of the most--

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe, one of the most
highly evolved cultures,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and that they did certainly
have a hand in creating,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and creation, in creating
the universe as we know it.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And some other races do as well.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But the mantis,
they are very highly

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
evolved beings,
incredible healers.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And they're very playful.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They love to laugh and have fun.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So they show up at my
house all the time.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And I-- they like to dance.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It sounds silly, but they
like to do movements.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And one morning I was
actually laying in bed.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And eight of them
showed up in my bedroom.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:90%
This was very calming for me.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And i go, good morning.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we would love for
you to get up and move with us,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
or some people might say dance.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And that sounds kind of silly.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:90%
But they have--

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> A little more than exercise.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Any being that has
evolved understands play,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the concept of play
and joy and laughter.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, I don't
want to, but I will.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.905 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Talk about
getting dragged out of bed

00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:33.705 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I was.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I was dragged out.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Could they at
least make you coffee?

00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I was complaining.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And so I got out of bed, OK.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:90%
And I started moving.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And my whole neck snapped.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
My whole spinal column aligned,
and my whole neck snapped.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And they had aligned my whole
spinal column and neck just

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I thanked
them for that.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So like a cosmic
chiropractic appointment.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And so they interact.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And they come to
me, and I draw a lot

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
of the symbols they give
me to share with others.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually, yes-- so I have
interactions with them often.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And even though they're very
high creators, and where

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
they come from, where I have
visited, they just, of course,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
all telepathically communicate
because they're energy.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And they have showed a little
about their culture with me.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And there is a temple that I've
been to at least six times.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- it's like a
crystalline temple that's

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:90%
a spiral.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've taken me
through, showing this to me.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
through the spiral.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And earlier on, what
the mantis beings

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
did was invite other
cultures, other races

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
to come that they felt were
ready to come and engage

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:90%
with being a part of a--

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
it's not really a ritual
but with experiencing

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
this crystalline
temple where they

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:90%
would go through the spiral.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And it would actually
help their DNA to evolve.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So the actual physical
structure of the temple was

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:90%
like a spiral form.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It's-- and it's not
density like here.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an etheric,
crystalline frequency.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredibly beautiful.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So I have a very high respect.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they're very
playful and can be very silly

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and give you information
that's just amazing.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.706 align:middle line:90%
On this New Year's Eve--

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I was sharing with
Rob that eight of them

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:90%
showed up at my house.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:90%
There was a white mantis being.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
So there's different species.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Some show up to me as being
a neon purple, blue green.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:90%
There's brown.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
different species.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So they all showed up.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were around
me most of the day.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
they were preparing

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
me to write down this DNA
code from them, which I did.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And after I wrote
it down, I shook--

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
my body shook for half
an hour because it

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:90%
was such high frequency.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thanked them
because I was so

00:15:52.150 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
moved that I could have the
opportunity to allow that,

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:90%
to just sit and come through.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it
was on the screen

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:90%
when I had given my talk.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And actually-- yeah.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So-- but they're very loving,
kind, compassionate fun, fun,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:90%
fun beings.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In this series, I've been
sort of creating a syllabus

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
of terms and definitions of
all this cosmic encounters that

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.720 align:middle line:90%
we've been having.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've become quite
fond of the term "density"

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and "dimensions."

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And we've sort of gone through
with some other entities

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
to sort of classify in a way.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Would you have any idea of
what dimension or density

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that the majority of
these beings reside in?

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're asking
about the mantis.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the mantis being.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective--
and again, there's

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
different species that are
in different frequencies.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Those who I interact with,
I would classify them more with

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:90%
the angelic realm definitely.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they appear
to people sometimes,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
they will appear with the
wings to not scare people.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And they're not truly wings.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:90%
It's their energy around them.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's how highly
evolved they are.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's almost beyond
physical form in a collective.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way to describe
it, it's like a drop of water

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.215 align:middle line:84%
in an ocean of consciousness
is what it is really.

00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And there is a singular
consciousness amongst them.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:90%
But they do have a--

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it's not a hive mind.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a collective.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> A collective.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like an ocean
of consciousness.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've explored-- in
past episodes we've explored

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Peleiadian collectives,
different densities

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and dimensions of
the collectives.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of seems that
from seventh and beyond,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
individuals sort of lose their--

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:90%
they don't lose it.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
They still have their individual
experiences and ideas.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
But then they start
operating from

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.835 align:middle line:90%
a collective consciousness.

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and there's
no ego involved.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Humanity, we have the ego,
and we need the ego here.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.988 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole
'nother experience--

00:18:31.988 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is a weight--

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.918 align:middle line:84%
>> --without the
ego, they understand,

00:18:35.918 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:90%
they know the oneness.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
We do too.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
You know, everyone really does.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:90%
It's remembering.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's just
there all the time.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a oneness, the love,
the harmony, the peace.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a curious-- you know,
it's infinite curiosity

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Curiosity on
their behalf or--

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They-- they're just curious.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And it gets into how
the universe was created

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and why we're all curious.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.687 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all curious.

00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The download I got-- and
you mentioned angels.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of made
the correlation.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So this-- the visitation I
had was on the lunar eclipse.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What perfect timing.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, when was it, the
end of September last year?

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And it went on
for a couple hours.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.067 align:middle line:84%
And I was shaking and
got a full on experience.

00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
And I've never had--

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this kind
of work and interviews

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and everything and ET
realms for a long time,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but I've never had a
personal experience.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wonderful.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was sort of getting
this download of the creation

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
not of the universe but
of the human experience.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And then I related--

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
so the Zetas came up,
the grays, and also,

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of reptilian
stuff came up.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of saw--

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
they were presenting to me
telepathically images of--

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and what I was I guess
translating in my own--

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
with these images,
having to translate,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, and all sorts
of stuff was happening.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But I saw how reptilians
saw them as angels.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.992 align:middle line:90%
Does that resonate?

00:20:30.992 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, if you think
about it, you know,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
you hear a lot of abduction
experiences where the mantis

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
beings always are
playing an observer role.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
They work with every--

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:90%
all the beings, all of them.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.265 align:middle line:84%
They don't like to-- they don't
interfere with the other races

00:20:53.265 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:90%
so much, you know?

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They're just they're
mostly to observe,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand every
aspect of creation.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
the time, they're

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:90%
just there as observers.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's--

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I got that there was a distress
call from the reptilians

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:84%
in a way that they
wanted to evolve,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I guess, out of their
reptilian archetypal structure.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do so, they
called upon the mantis,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
just like we would pray
to an angel in that sense.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the mantis
beings came in.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's how
the human experience was

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
formed, to help the evolution
of this reptilian consciousness.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that resonates.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
They also have--

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%
I do know they also have--

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
they have symbiotic
relationships

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of beings too
because for an example,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.643 align:middle line:90%
there's is a race of beings.

00:21:49.643 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:90%
They would look like a gray.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They look just like a
gray, except for the ones

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.577 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen there,
they have a small head.

00:21:58.577 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
They're really short,
like, three feet tall,

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
wear a black
jumpsuit type thing.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.605 align:middle line:84%
They have these
lines on their faces

00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:90%
that are just like wrinkles.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.623 align:middle line:84%
And they were
created so that way,

00:22:14.623 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
the mantis beings can
interact with lower dimensions

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
when the mantis work

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
with me, these little gray
guys, who act as a barrier of--

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because I've had an
experience where I was eating.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
My wife made some jalapeno--
bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
She put the toothpick into it.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.412 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
gobbling them down.

00:22:39.412 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I accidentally
swallowed a toothpick.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And so--

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.038 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, well,
it doesn't hurt me now.

00:22:46.038 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a little upset
stomach, but I'm

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.288 align:middle line:84%
going to have to deal
with this tomorrow.

00:22:49.288 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, 12 o'clock at night.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm really bad
about going to the doctor

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:90%
when I'm supposed to.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.916 align:middle line:90%
But next thing I know, I feel--

00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
my body starts stretching out.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see these
little beings walk in

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and the mantis
being behind them.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The mantis being says, you know,
this is going to feel weird.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And the little guy puts
his hand in my stomach,

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and it goes into my stomach.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever a hand
go into your stomach,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:90%
it's the weirdest feeling ever.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So I snapped out of it,
out of my paralysis.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I grabbed the
being by the head.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I had my thumb in
its mouth, you know?

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's chewing on my thumb.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:10%
I could feel its little
gums, and its saliva,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:10%
and its soft skin.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:10%
And the mantis being just
waves its hand over me.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:10%
And the next thing I
know, I'm having a dream

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:10%
where I'm chasing butterflies.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So the mantis being, they've
evolved to the point where

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:10%
their minds can
manipulate matter.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:10%
So let's take this pillow--

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Levitate.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's take this pillow
for an example, right?

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:10%
They have the ability
to make the electrons

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.828 align:middle line:10%
and atoms in this pillow move
to match their frequency.

00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:10%
And so they can just
move through it.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:10%
So it's all-- they're just
masters of the universe.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:10%
So they don't even
really need technology.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking grays
and reptilians-- or not

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:90%
reptilians, mantis.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the mantis.

00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, they use
the symbiotic relationships

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:90%
with these little gray guys.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But the work that they do
with the reptilians is--

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
like, they need this,
and helping them evolve

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:90%
and just to observe everything.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So did you get
the toothpick out?

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:90%
It was out.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:90%
It did get out.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:90%
That was fine.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But what a weird feeling, having
a hand digging in your stomach.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, weird.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, for years, people have
been trying to get Robert and I

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:10%
together--

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, over
the phone and that.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And we both had so much
going on at the same time,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:90%
we just did not connect.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:10%
A couple years ago, I
came to this conference.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And Robert was here as well.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
He was staying in
a separate place.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually getting
ready to leave the conference.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So all these people
were around us, saying,

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:90%
you two gotta get together now.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Now's the time.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Now's the time,
which was awesome.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And we came together.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking
at each other.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't even speak.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Our mouths just fell open.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And we were just like,
holy cow and knew

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
we are on ships together, have
been, are on ships together,

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and that we have this really
close mantis connection.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And so then we started
communicating after we

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.255 align:middle line:90%
met at the other meeting.

00:26:10.255 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Then we're at another--

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:90%
so we met.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We didn't talk.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we met at
another meeting,

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:90%
actually, in April of 2015.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And we got to spend a
lot of time together.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And we just really clicked.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We spontaneously, when
we were together--

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and there were a few
other hybrids around--

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we spontaneously did
the mantis bow together.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> The mantis bow.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> We had never--

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.178 align:middle line:84%
there was no way either of
us could have known that.

00:26:54.178 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
We had never-- we just
spontaneously did it.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we went into speaking
the way we do as a mantis.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
had so much fun.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:10%
Everybody was having fun there,
watching and enjoying it.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:10%
And so he and I, Robert and I
have been very connected since.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:10%
We talk a lot over the
phone and have discussions

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:10%
that most people
would not understand.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:10%
That's mantis.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:10%
So we get to share these
wonderful happenings

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:10%
and frequencies.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:10%
And that is very special for us.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way I put it-- it's
like a similar feeling that

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
people can relate to, it's the
same thing as two Americans

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:90%
living in Russia, for example.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And we don't speak
Russian very well.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, of these two
Americans, we meet.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And oh, not only are
we two Americans,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
but we're from the same
state or from the same town.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have this really, really
unique connection that Russians

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.070 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to understand.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact same
feeling, you know.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So you had this greeting.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.843 align:middle line:90%
Was sort of an unconscious bow--

00:28:16.843 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It just happened
spontaneously.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --greeting that
just happened.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
language, is it actually

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.802 align:middle line:84%
another separate
language language?

00:28:24.802 --> 00:28:25.602 align:middle line:90%
It's not English?

00:28:25.602 --> 00:28:26.486 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:26.486 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And is it-- and you
understand the words?

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more intuitive?

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.473 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more of a frequency.

00:28:37.473 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it, they don't really

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:90%
talk in a language.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a frequency.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a psychic
vibrational connection that you

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:90%
just-- it's hard to understand--

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're not actually
moving your lips then.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you are.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's out loud, yeah.

00:28:56.055 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thought
we-- it was fun.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a physical
manifestation of communication.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Of that energy.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't bring
it through in English.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.303 align:middle line:84%
And the voice shifts in
all kinds of ways to--

00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
it's pure frequency
coming through English,

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
which I respect.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I love English.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But I love the other language
because it just comes through.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It's so pure.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a learned thing.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.488 align:middle line:90%
- It's a natural thing.

00:29:34.488 --> 00:29:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a natural
soul kind of language.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had a being say once--

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:84%
another hybrid, they're just
full on realized, you know?

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to bring
their full ET self in.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They say, everybody uses
the harsh words, you know.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It's hard on our ears.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It hurts our ears.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they speak
like you speak?

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they
talk like you talk?

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
When you do the language, it's
like it's just a frequency.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Harsh words meaning
English being harsh words?

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the vibration of our
language is a third dimensional

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
language, so if you imagine,
it would be like someone who

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
listens to Mozart now
having death metal played

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:90%
in their ear.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I can see that.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the
difference, you know.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very-- the
energy here is very harsh.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what I hear.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
part of the reason--

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially compared to
those other frequencies

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and vibrations.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of frequencies
and vibrations,

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:84%
when they physically visit
you, when you said eight beings

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:84%
visit you, are they physically
manifested in this density?

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to lower their
density to a physical form?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They-- I often see
them etherically and feel

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:90%
the energy.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It's very palpable.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But when they showed up on
New Year's Eve this year,

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:90%
they really came in.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And we were dancing.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what--

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:90%
tell me about that.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, the energies--

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:84%
because depending on how the
energies are at the time,

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
they said, we can
come in this way

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
at this time because of the
frequencies around Earth.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for us
to come in right now.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking
this opportunity.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally opened
my eyes in the morning,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and this white mantis
was right in front of me.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, good morning.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:90%
That is just how I am.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they were pretty
much in this density.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And they can materialize.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But it takes them a
great deal of energy to--

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> To manifest in this density.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've heard some people,
some say these higher beings

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that do--

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that sort of their
baseline resonance

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
is at a higher density
than they would--

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to come here, they
actually create holograms

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
or create avatars to manifest
in this reality because--

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That goes with the symbiotic
relationships with the lower

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:90%
dimensional beings too.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
communicating

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.610 align:middle line:84%
using these other beings
to sort of help as a--

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But I see the form,
I mean, they are mantis.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't--

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> They can solidify
here though.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.365 align:middle line:90%
It's easier for them to--

00:32:48.365 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for the higher
dimensional beings

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.633 align:middle line:84%
to come to the lower
dimensions than it

00:32:51.633 --> 00:32:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is for a lower dimension
being to come to the higher

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> So they do solidify.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:90%
They can only do it for so long.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And for them to come
here, they may only

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
be able to spend a
few minutes, you know,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.690 align:middle line:84%
as far as our time
perspective goes.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they get trapped
here then if they're long?

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Or does it--

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.715 align:middle line:90%
- [LAUGHS]

00:33:12.715 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You pointed to yourself.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:90%
You were like, this is a trap.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a mantis being that got
stuck in the human incarnation

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And some hybrids really
do feel that way, honestly,

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:90%
that they're trapped.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And some are very upset
that I've talked to.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They're very-- you know,
I got trapped here.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of bitter
about the experience.

00:33:34.635 --> 00:33:38.433 align:middle line:84%
>> --have a different
point of view than we do.

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> That takes is
into the mission.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah, OK.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So speaking of the mission
then, let's get into that.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:90%
What is the mission?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Why this contact?

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Why the hybridization?

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Why-- what's going on?

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really a
multi-dimensional thing, right?

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.465 align:middle line:84%
So there's many, many layers
and different aspects to why.

00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
why, for me anyways,

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:84%
they had to do a little bit
of the tweaking so that way,

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness could
incarnate into this body, right?

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, that doesn't make me--

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
in all reality,
it doesn't make me

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.992 align:middle line:84%
much different from me and
you because when it happens,

00:34:22.992 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
I have the same thing.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I forget.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any memory of this.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if, like,
you want to understand

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:90%
what it is to be--

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
let's see-- an ant,
for an example, right?

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would come and live
the life of an ant, right?

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't just like--

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:84%
you can sit there and
study them all you want.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.129 align:middle line:84%
But actually get to understand
it is to incarnate as one.

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:50.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
>> And it could have
the exact same--

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:90%
not as superpower ant.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Sure, some things
do bleed through,

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
like some psychic
things and whatnot.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:90%
But as far as me, it's--

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.843 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
psychicness or any of that.

00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm sure it was there.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't realize it.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But you know, to live
a human experience,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
childhood, you know,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and the harshness
of this reality.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So that way, I can
better understand

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:84%
what it is to be a human
being, just so I can understand

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
humanity so when they do
come to introduce themselves

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to humanity, they
can now figure out

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:84%
how can I do this without
completely destroying

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:90%
this civilization.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you go back
to the ant analogy here,

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.390 align:middle line:84%
imagine now you, as a person,
looking at an ant colony,

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's say someone came by
and kicked the ant hill, right?

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're coming
down, looking at it.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a person, how do I
make these ants not go crazy?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't just take your
finger, and you put your finger

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:90%
in the ant hill--

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> They'll bite it.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> They're going to
go crazy, you know?

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.158 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to
sit back and observe.

00:36:08.158 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And the only way we can--

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the only way they can help the
ants now is to go in as an ant

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and tell the ants, hey, guys,
don't worry about the big dude

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.060 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.108 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:36:20.108 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to panic.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Just rebuild--

00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> They're only here to help.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Or the big dude up there
just wasn't paying attention

00:36:26.198 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and kicked over the hill.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So we just gotta
rebuild the hill.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of us
come down to help

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.073 align:middle line:90%
so it's not so frightening.

00:36:36.073 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
frightening because I've

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.540 align:middle line:90%
been through the fear.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of my
mission, if you will,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to go through being
ignorant, being--

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was go, George
Bush, you know, at the time,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:90%
and bomb Saddam.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was, like, ignorant,
just a typical American.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, America, woo!

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And then all of a
sudden, it's like I said,

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:90%
a ET comes around.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- it scared
the daylights out of me.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't want--

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:90%
they didn't like--

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So you really did.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Most of us sort of have this--

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:90%
what's the word I'm looking for?

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Slow, for me, I discovered
spirituality and martial arts,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and you know, kind of
been digesting this stuff.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So you went from George
Bush to a mantis being.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, my god, yeah,
a mantis being.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And it-- I mean, I believe that
most of the human population is

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
completely unaware of and
ignorant to the reality of--

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Reality.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Of reality, exactly.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What we know reality is.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What reality is.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So I ended up becoming
a fractal of what I believe

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:90%
what's to come.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's contact
with the beings.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what's going
to happen at first,

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.360 align:middle line:84%
when most of the population
just has the truth smack him

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:90%
in the face--

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, the same
thing happened to me.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The truth smacked
me in the face.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So now that I have
that experience,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to tell people,
it's OK, it's OK.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, I've worked the steps.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.547 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through the
trials and tribulations.

00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In a short amount
of time it sounds like.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> An extremely
short amount of time.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You're here.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm alive.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:35.756 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
been a nightmare.

00:38:35.756 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want to
get into how it started.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if you want
to do your mission first.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been an animal
communicator for 36 years

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:90%
professionally.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
telepathic and psychic.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Earlier on, I had
dreams that came true,

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and knew when someone
was going to cross over,

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.020 align:middle line:84%
which was not fun
to know sometimes.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>> In the-- with the animals?

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Or with people.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> With humans because I
worked with both people

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:90%
and the animals psychically.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And so it's been a rough road.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And my abilities
developed earlier on

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:84%
because I had a near-death
experience at six years old.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So I went into all those realms
and knew it and came back

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of that, it
unfolded for me in that--

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been through some very
tough stuff in my life,

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:44.150 align:middle line:84%
as most of us have, and had
another near-death experience

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.950 align:middle line:90%
in my 20s.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And that really set me on
my path with all of this.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it really kicked
me in super high gear

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:90%
into using telepathy.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I was-- other things were
going on psychically as well.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So I chose to use those energies
to communicate with animals

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and to be of service, to give
the animals a voice so people

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:90%
could understand the animals.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I was working
psychically with people

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.650 align:middle line:84%
as well, doing psychic
readings for people.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:26.245 align:middle line:84%
And then when I fully realized
I had the ET frequencies and all

00:40:26.245 --> 00:40:31.350 align:middle line:84%
of that, then I started
opening and really unfolding.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Things started unfolding
for me to get into that.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I see my mission
as giving the message

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that we are all one
and helping people

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch
with who they are.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the star
readings I do help

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.810 align:middle line:90%
their star families show up.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just get them
connected and give messages

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and give them tone mantras
to do that really connect.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So I love doing that.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It's great fun.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'm a certified
hypnotherapist and work

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:84%
with experiencers to help
them process their experiences

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.680 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
through it all,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really with positive
experience with beings,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
not so positive
experiences with beings.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly understand the
human experience pretty much

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:90%
from A to Z, I can say.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pretty wide spectrum.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been an
interesting life.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad I'm at where I
am at and so grateful to be

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:90%
here and have many miracles.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have had two NDEs.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.297 align:middle line:90%
>> NDEs, what's an NDE?

00:41:45.297 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Near-death experiences.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, right.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And another time, I almost
died about 11 years ago.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's been quite a walk.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.476 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that from an actual
physical event and then--

00:41:57.476 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, just some--

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've had a lot of
miracles in order to stay here

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:90%
and continue sharing.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I love sharing with people
and talking about all of this

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and about star
beings and sharing

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:84%
about the different
kinds of cultures

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of star beings and their
languages and symbols.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm doing
a lot of that now,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:84%
like language and
symbols with people.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I can't think of
anything to do that would be

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.804 align:middle line:90%
more fun.

00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, getting back to your guys'
interactions, in this realm,

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in this plain, you had this sort
of, I guess, psychic exchange.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you have actual memories
of being on the ships that you

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:84%
might be able to share and
what those experiences--

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and what entailed--

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:84%
what's going on,
or what happened.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> If you want to.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I do, but I'm trying to think
of which one would be best.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we were--

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.300 align:middle line:90%
without going into much detail.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Robert on the
phone, and I said, you know,

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going on this ship, asking
for healing for something.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I had gone on the
ship and had done some work.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we got on
the phone after that.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.960 align:middle line:90%
And Robert says--

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I told her, I said--

00:43:37.665 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:90%
because I was laying in bed.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK,
I'm going to do one

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of my healings for
Jacquelin here.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'll transfer my
consciousness to the craft.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden, I
hear her voice, saying, Rob,

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm already here.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm already here.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.445 align:middle line:84%
Then the being said, yeah,
she's already been here.

00:43:56.445 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:90%
It's already done.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:90%
She's in Illinois, right?

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Ohio.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Ohio.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.210 align:middle line:90%
She's in Ohio.

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:06.315 align:middle line:90%
And I'm over in California.

00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So the time difference,
she's already in bed,

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.570 align:middle line:90%
doing the things.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.403 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm just
going to get started.

00:44:11.403 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, Rob, it's
already been done.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> But as far as--

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you two
experiences that I

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:25.820 align:middle line:84%
would say are my most
profound experiences ever.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And I drew pictures of it.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:32.520 align:middle line:84%
To recreate my experience,
I'll let you check them out.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, please.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The one-- one of my most
memorable was when I have

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.120 align:middle line:90%
an experience, I call it--

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I come into
consciousness or become

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:84%
aware of that I'm
having the experience,

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
'cause you go to bed,
and next thing you know,

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:90%
you're having an experience.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:90%
So all of a sudden--

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a lucid dream.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's not-- it's not a dream.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I can tell the difference
between a dream

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and an experience
because there's touch.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.780 align:middle line:90%
There's texture.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:90%
There's smell.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.530 align:middle line:90%
There's taste, you know.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just like-- you know,
in dreams, you don't get--

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.040 align:middle line:90%
we don't get this, you know?

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm able to
tell the difference

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.120 align:middle line:84%
between an actual
experience and a dream.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
one, I came into awareness.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I remember--
how do I start this?

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
multidimensional.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember being able to
see 360 degrees around me.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I was smaller.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I was probably about the
size of a tennis ball.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was inside--

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I remember seeing--

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Here's my perspective.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing hands like this and
a being's face staring at me.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And then I look around.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I can see around the being.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And my body is in a chair
like this, slumped over.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:90%
The top of my head was removed.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And you could see my
brain with all the veins

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and all the layers of--

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:90%
the film layers.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's three beings
there rubbing their hands

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.100 align:middle line:90%
through my brain.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what I realized
was what I was they

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.920 align:middle line:84%
pulled my consciousness
out of my body

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and was holding my consciousness
in my hand, which we all

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.630 align:middle line:84%
are just this little
spark of divine creation.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the 21 grams.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's no-- when you're
in that state of consciousness,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:54.450 align:middle line:84%
when you're pulled out from
your body, there's no fear.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.900 align:middle line:90%
There's just curiosity.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I remember thinking, wait.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:58.985 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:46:58.985 --> 00:46:59.785 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:46:59.785 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that me?

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.252 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's me.

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the being
goes-- the being

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:90%
realized that I became aware.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, oh,
oh, oh, hey, there.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Hey, why is a
giraffe's neck so long?

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Why is a giraffe's next so long?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.423 align:middle line:84%
And it says, because
of its vertebrae.

00:47:16.423 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATES LAUGH]

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just
cracking up, right?

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I
remember thinking, I

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:84%
can't believe that
this being just

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.710 align:middle line:90%
made an attempt at this joke.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a terrible joke,
but it's hilarious.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And my body--

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking around, and
my body goes, [SLOW LAUGH]

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.920 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be so crazy.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Human joke.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about it, right?

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just
melted my brain.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is before--

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.932 align:middle line:84%
this is when my experiences
were starting, so at that time,

00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't quite really--

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.682 align:middle line:84%
I was just, like, coming
in, like-- so when

00:47:53.682 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next--
all of a sudden, black.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up, feel
like I hit by a train.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no marks on my head.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever get what
they were doing to your brain?

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> A little later, yeah.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.330 align:middle line:90%
But at that time, I had no idea.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:90%
It freaked me out.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, waking up back
in my body, back in my self,

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:90%
going what the was that?

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying,
what the was that?

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it scared
the crap out of me

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.510 align:middle line:84%
because I was getting
sick at that time.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of my
experience, I was 210 pounds.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Went to 120 pounds.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor said I was dying.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.740 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know why.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.527 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, I
was thinking, oh, god,

00:48:39.527 --> 00:48:40.610 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing to me?

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:90%
They're killing me.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is bad.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.760 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the case.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I wake
up the next day.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just freaking out.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.432 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to work at 6 o'clock
in the morning at a hardware

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:90%
store that I worked at.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't call in
sick and say, hey,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I was abducted by
aliens last night.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Can I not come in to work today?

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that was
my most profound--

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's--

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> --experiences.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I found out later they were
just repairing the damage that

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:15.590 align:middle line:84%
was done to my brain through
being diagnosed with ADHD

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and having the
anti-depressants my whole life.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were just repairing
the damage that was--

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, they're repairing
the pharmaceutical damage.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.252 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had a similar
experience where they went

00:49:25.252 --> 00:49:30.470 align:middle line:84%
into my brain as well to
recalibrate, they told me,

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that they had the reset, going
to recalibrate some things

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.030 align:middle line:84%
after something I had gone
through physically with hitting

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.020 align:middle line:90%
my head.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a really--
and I was awake.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was very aware of it.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's such a weird feeling
because I could see my brain.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what they
were doing so I was OK.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But they had their
hands in my brain

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and just shifting
some things around.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:10.080 align:middle line:90%
And they said, it's all OK.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And I really trusted that.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
levitated me above my bed

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:24.150 align:middle line:84%
several times when I was
still getting into all this.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they came one
night to recalibrate me.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.183 align:middle line:90%
And I was like not as OK.

00:50:31.183 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all
been through our fear.

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:36.472 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're hybrids and
that, we're like anybody else.

00:50:36.472 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:90%
We've been through our stuff.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they showed
up in my room.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was in bed.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And I started running
for the door, thinking--

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't open the door.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And they levitated me, like,
five feet up over my bed.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just, like,
being levitated.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, do you think
you can calm down now?

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I just was on
the bed, paralyzed.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And then I was gone.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So the next night,
they came again.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And I got up to run again.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And they said, are we going
to go through this again?

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And I went, no.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around and
went back into the bed.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And then I was just gone again.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:32.480 align:middle line:84%
But we've had to work
through our fear of it.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, I was
being levitated.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.540 align:middle line:10%
Are you kidding me?

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.665 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, that's terrifying.

00:51:37.665 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I was terrified.

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this is what
we're going to say to you.

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:51.760 align:middle line:84%
If a parent's child has
had something go wrong

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and they need to be taken to the
hospital to be administered to,

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and the child's kicking
and screaming, saying,

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go, but
what is the parent going

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.860 align:middle line:90%
to do in the end?

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take the
child to the hospital.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's basically
what we need to do with you

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and to get some things--

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:84%
your frequencies
recalibrated in your brain.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And so they reset me.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And that made me feel better.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And I knew they were loving,
compassionate, and kind.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's that the human response,
even if you don't want to.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But after that, I have no
trouble with experiences now.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like, hey--

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Love the experience.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.865 align:middle line:90%
>> And experiencing--

00:52:53.865 --> 00:52:54.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:52:54.673 --> 00:52:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I crave them, yeah.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready to visit the ship.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But we all go through
our fear experiences

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:06.460 align:middle line:84%
too before we fully
know who we are.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing is, as a human,
we experience the traumas of--

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, just--

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god,just this crazy--

00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Everyone I know is--

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I think all of
humanity has PTSD.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, seriously.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we're getting PTSD
from the drugs we're taking

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:90%
for the PTSD.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but it took me a
while to process all of that.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the next
day I was like--

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's all a matter
of perspective.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I really want to say this
is that some people might

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
be freaked out the rest of
their life from that, saying,

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:90%
they're evil.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.610 align:middle line:90%
They levitated me.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.570 align:middle line:90%
They paralyzed me.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:56.460 align:middle line:90%
They took me.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what they did to me?

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.950 align:middle line:84%
That could be one
perspective of the victim.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't choose
to be a victim.

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm a part of this.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.780 align:middle line:90%
My soul volunteered to do this.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And so once I got a handle and
could get beyond the fear--

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and I know I experienced
that so I can understand

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.890 align:middle line:84%
when I work with experiencers
that deep fear of going

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:34.170 align:middle line:84%
like, holy crap, what is
going on, and being taken.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So it truly is, with everything,
a matter of perspective.

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It truly is.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That I'm an experiencer.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an abductee.

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Which there's
a night and day,

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.310 align:middle line:90%
a difference of even saying it.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.597 align:middle line:84%
>> I had to-- that's one of
the major things that I had go

00:54:56.597 --> 00:55:00.330 align:middle line:84%
through was that I had the
perspective of these guys were

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.770 align:middle line:90%
evil and taking over.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I went up for my first
craft, I thought, this is it.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.510 align:middle line:90%
This is doomsday.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.960 align:middle line:84%
The ships are here to
take us and everything.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And my first craft
that I ever saw--

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I got a picture of that
craft I'm talking about.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It was, like, a 45-minute
encounter with a ship.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, oh, my gosh.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good person.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a benevolent being.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm friendly.

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't hurt me.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't hurt me.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Even my wife-- imagine
a black triangle,

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.330 align:middle line:84%
almost half the size
of a football field,

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.090 align:middle line:84%
with, like, black
holes up inside

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.350 align:middle line:90%
of it oozing out blue plasma.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:40.900 align:middle line:90%
If it's a--

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And so your wife has been--

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> She's been experiencing--

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> --experiencing
things along with you.

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you're hanging
out with a mantis,

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.100 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get something.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:59.191 align:middle line:84%
>> The interesting thing is
that with me and my wife,

00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:03.550 align:middle line:84%
they didn't start waking us both
up until we both got together.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like they waited
until we had that support.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Because without her, I wouldn't
be here talking to you.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have survived
my tribulation period,

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.203 align:middle line:90%
as I like to call it.

00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:16.120 align:middle line:84%
There's no way in heck
I would've survived it.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of waited for
me to have the support.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And then in turn, is she
having her own individual

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.090 align:middle line:90%
experiences as well?

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, she is.

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:27.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But I'm lucky that
I get to share it

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.590 align:middle line:90%
with somebody, so lucky.

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It seems the message
I've been getting

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:39.390 align:middle line:84%
with all these interviews is
we're sort of at this place

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and time in our evolution
as the humanity has

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:84%
been doing this cycle for
25,000 years or more--

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Or more, yeah, definitely.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But at least
in this go round.

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That we are ending this
karmic cycle and going

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.060 align:middle line:90%
into something different here.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the messages
you guys have been getting?

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.492 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it becomes a
whole ascension event, right,

00:57:07.492 --> 00:57:08.700 align:middle line:90%
the impurity you've heard of.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And what is the ascension event?

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that you
say 25,000 years ago

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.260 align:middle line:90%
because what is at the--

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.780 align:middle line:84%
how far is the distance
between the sun and the center

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way Galaxy?

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It's approximately
25,000, 26,000 years.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So on a physical level,
from my understanding,

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.880 align:middle line:90%
imagine this took--

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.310 align:middle line:84%
our astronomers are
just now discovering

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing the light from
this event that happened.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So about 25,000 to 26,000
years ago, a gas cloud

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.560 align:middle line:84%
came in and fell into the
center of our black hole,

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.600 align:middle line:84%
the super massive black hole
at the center of the galaxy.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.182 align:middle line:84%
And we really don't
have any kind of--

00:57:52.182 --> 00:57:54.060 align:middle line:84%
as a species, our
scientists can't really

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.700 align:middle line:84%
comprehend what the
super massive black hole

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.200 align:middle line:90%
is at the center.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the gas cloud
falls into the center,

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:84%
it's instantly converting
all that mass and matter

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.210 align:middle line:90%
into energy, right?

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And it pulses.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It pushes out this
energetic pulse, right?

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
We see in other galaxies
and our own galaxy

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.870 align:middle line:84%
before remnants of previous
times a black hole woken up.

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be
an energetic beam

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that shoots up 50,000 light
years, you know, one going up,

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:30.280 align:middle line:90%
one going down.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can imagine,
that's a lot of energy.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is this
energetic wave comes out

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.690 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's traveling near
the speed of light.

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:47.965 align:middle line:84%
The light itself takes 25,000,
26,000 years for astronomers.

00:58:47.965 --> 00:58:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, OK, the
gas cloud's going in.

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.340 align:middle line:90%
We're right behind the light.

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the energy of it,
just this wave coming outwards.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.460 align:middle line:90%
And it changes everything.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:03.376 align:middle line:90%
You know, it changes everything.

00:59:03.376 --> 00:59:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.650 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand,
that's part of one

00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:10.950 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons why and
ET started coming back

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:13.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's like,
OK, the negativity

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.850 align:middle line:84%
is getting out of
hand here on Earth.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And here comes this wave.

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.070 align:middle line:90%
What happens when this--

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a frequency.

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.110 align:middle line:84%
What happens when this frequency
gets to Earth, and Earth is,

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:28.912 align:middle line:84%
[LOW HUM] and here
comes this [HIGH HUM]??

00:59:28.912 --> 00:59:29.870 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Clash.

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Chaos.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I see.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:33.642 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:59:33.642 --> 00:59:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So if you look at things--

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a storm.

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a storm, exactly.

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So when this wave
gets here, they

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:42.500 align:middle line:84%
want to help try to
raise the vibration

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.860 align:middle line:84%
to get the planet
frequency specific

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:48.560 align:middle line:84%
so this galactic wave
does hurt the Earth.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It just evolves.

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> The hot and cold pressures--

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> --don't collide as hard
so you don't get a hurricane.

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:58.310 align:middle line:90%
You get just a few raindrops.

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>> They took me--

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that ship that I went
on, they took me up once.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.380 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.575 align:middle line:90%
>> The triangle ship?

01:00:08.575 --> 01:00:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, with these beings that
you didn't even know who they

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.160 align:middle line:90%
were.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.720 align:middle line:90%
But the mantis being--

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.400 align:middle line:84%
there was a mantis and a
zeta aboard that craft.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And they used each
other's ships.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the mantis
beings even need ships.

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.630 align:middle line:90%
But--

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they have light--

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced light ships.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I've been on light
ships with mantis.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.517 align:middle line:90%
>> They use a coalition.

01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:31.100 align:middle line:84%
They'll just-- they'll
be on the ship.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:35.518 align:middle line:84%
So the experience
was, this beings--

01:00:35.518 --> 01:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I wake up in the
middle of the night,

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.308 align:middle line:84%
you know, and walk
down the hallway.

01:00:39.308 --> 01:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's, like, a French
door that goes to the back.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tall, white zeta,
if you will, standing there.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.272 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
need to let me in.

01:00:48.272 --> 01:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I ain't
gonna let you in, man.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So it says, well, we'll do this
every idea until you let me in.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.375 align:middle line:90%
And so I pass out, wake up.

01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:00.500 align:middle line:90%
The next night, same thing.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Let me in.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Let me in.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.190 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'll let you in.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
I crack the door open.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It sticks its hand through,
and I slammed the door.

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%
It's fighting, you know?

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And it pulls away.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It's rubbing its hand.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.280 align:middle line:90%
And It sits down.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:13.730 align:middle line:90%
I sit down.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:14.688 align:middle line:90%
We stare at each other.

01:01:14.688 --> 01:01:16.210 align:middle line:90%
He's like, it's OK, man.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're going
to sit here and do this

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.000 align:middle line:90%
until you let me in.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.717 align:middle line:84%
>> And finally, the third
night, I let him in.

01:01:22.717 --> 01:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
All right, dude, let's do this.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
He's like, all right, follow me.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I go up with him.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
There's that triangle
craft floating above me.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And it pulls me up into it.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you
know, he's standing

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
in front of the view screen.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a view screen.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, come here.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.010 align:middle line:90%
And walk-- and he has telepathy.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I walk up.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're over the
valley where I live--

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
where I lived, the
Salinas Valley.

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's, like,
northern lights, right,

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.240 align:middle line:90%
but red and orange.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like translucent energy.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't in the sky,
and it was on the ground.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And I remember going, oh, shit.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just seeing the world
in-- because I was listening

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:09.890 align:middle line:90%
to the--

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.242 align:middle line:90%
I think his name--

01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
well, one of the remote viewers
that talk about this kill

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.510 align:middle line:90%
shot with the sun.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Ed Dames.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.165 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought--

01:02:20.165 --> 01:02:22.112 align:middle line:84%
I thought for sure
that that's what I saw.

01:02:22.112 --> 01:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- I was
like, oh, my god,

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
you guys are showing me the kill
shot that destroys everything.

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:28.980 align:middle line:90%
They're like, don't be silly.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not what this is.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
What they showed me,
it's this energetic wave

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the
central black hole.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of like
a hug from the creator.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way I can put it.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it snaps the minds
of humanity up to be like,

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
there's more to this universe
than just these walls.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Us, humans and--

01:02:50.802 --> 01:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --the couch,
there's more to it.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%


01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But it goes-- you know, it even
goes further than that too.

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.610 align:middle line:90%
How would I describe this?

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself as
you are now, right?

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And you look forward.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:12.370 align:middle line:90%
You look backwards, right?

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
Imagine all these
different strings

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.642 align:middle line:10%
that come from your center.

01:03:15.642 --> 01:03:17.100 align:middle line:10%
There's all these
different strings

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.930 align:middle line:10%
that kind of go off in infinite
amount of directions, right?

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
What that is, represents
at this point,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
there's an infinite
amount of possibilities

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:28.250 align:middle line:90%
for me to do, right?

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
An infinite amount
of possibilities.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.498 align:middle line:90%
Behind me is the same.

01:03:31.498 --> 01:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite
amount of possibilities

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.302 align:middle line:90%
that got me here, right?

01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So an infinite amount of
possibility that got me here

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and an infinite amount
of possibilities

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.880 align:middle line:90%
to where I'm going to go.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:49.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, we experience these
possibilities simultaneously.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.705 align:middle line:84%
The thing that my
little spark is

01:03:50.705 --> 01:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like a
little zipper that pulls

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.590 align:middle line:90%
all these experiences together.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:56.855 align:middle line:90%
It's a singularity, if you will.

01:03:56.855 --> 01:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It pulls all these
experiences together.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And then now, my
spark gets to choose

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
which way I'm going to go.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's hard
for me to jump from--

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
because this spark is
experiencing this spectrum,

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't just jump
to this spectrum.

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I kind of have to navigate--

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Through the bars, yeah.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, but we split.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.480 align:middle line:90%
We're constantly splitting.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're experiencing
every possibility.

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens when this
happens over countless numbers

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.243 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years?

01:04:27.243 --> 01:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go back
to everything's

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:33.543 align:middle line:84%
a fractal of itself, what
happens in our universe,

01:04:33.543 --> 01:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
as far as you know,
when something

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.250 align:middle line:90%
gets too big for its britches?

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a star
for an example.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
When a star gets too big, it
collapses in on itself, right?

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a supernova, a black
hole, a white dwarf, whatever.

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming a new
divine expression of creation.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It wants to experience--
oh, I'm too big.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's experience something new.

01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
lines that go out.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And we've exhausted it.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
On this planet, we've exhausted
all the possibilities.

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.140 align:middle line:90%
So now, it's gotten too big.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, now our
possibilities are collapsing in

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:12.920 align:middle line:90%
on themselves.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just one big--

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The timelines.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --compression, yeah, the
timelines and everything.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a compression.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're experiencing all
these possible realities

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.370 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And now they're--

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the limitations
of the third density.

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're collapsing
in on themselves.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.927 align:middle line:10%
And we become a new
expression of divine creation.

01:05:33.927 --> 01:05:35.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Fourth density consciousness.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And how do you want to
experience that event is up

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.330 align:middle line:10%
to how you want
to experience it.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If it's going to be
a world-ending event,

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:46.417 align:middle line:84%
then that's how you're going
to experience your collapse.

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hear
about the collapse

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
of the economy and collapse of
society, collapse, collapse,

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%
collapse.

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's a collapse of possible--

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Of those old paradigm
ways of doing things.

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Because we've exhausted the--

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
we cannot continue to
do things in that way.

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And somehow, somehow the
trigger is this energetic wave

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.645 align:middle line:84%
from the black
hole that's coming.

01:06:09.645 --> 01:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
triggers that collapse.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It lines right with all the
other teachings and sayings,

01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
the harmonic convergence of 87.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
There are so many potential--
people will ask me,

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
well, what's absolutely
going to happen?

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.542 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
possibilities--

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying this in
a little different way,

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
but kind of the
same-- of timelines,

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
there are all those choices
or potentials that can happen,

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
depending on what humanity
chooses, also collectively.

01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But each soul gets to choose
their journey as well.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
For me, a very key message
of what we term ascension

01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
is basically about humanity
remembering that they

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
are one with everything.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We are all one, that
we are cosmic citizens,

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and that expansion
in consciousness,

01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and that on Earth that we need
to come together in cooperation

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and to live from our hearts.

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, then there is
no need for the greed, the war,

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and struggle, if we all
come to that remembrance

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are divine,
that we are all divine.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, for
me, that is a big part

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
of our message as
hybrids or my--

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.310 align:middle line:90%
you know, what we like to share.

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And but the message,
I think, as being

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid is really
to help people

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
understand we are all cosmic.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.240 align:middle line:90%
They are family.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Really, they are
us, and we are them.

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And they are evolving
just as we are evolving.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.399 align:middle line:84%
They've told me
this over and over.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You think you're the only ones
going through the process?

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
They go, we're going through
this process as well.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.779 align:middle line:84%
It's all of creation moving
through this incredible process

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that is just inspiring.

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it does
come out to a new creation.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And I like to talk
about the new human.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call it kind of the
new human awakening and coming

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
into being a new
creation in that way.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what
we are here for, bottom line.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So this new consciousness
comes with a new whole set

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.649 align:middle line:90%
of DNA upgrades.

01:09:02.649 --> 01:09:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, the DNA shift.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:14.529 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and all of that
is happening in terms

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
of the energy just cosmically.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just happening.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The creations-- we're all
the creation's expression.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And creation is shifting
and evolving all the time.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we're an opportunity.

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a period
of time on Earth

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have the opportunity
to really embrace and remember

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%
who we really are.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not these bodies.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not-- we're not-
Joe accountant or whoever.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
That is not our main identity
or the car, all of that.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole illusion
that we're evolving out of.

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll give you
this real quick.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Our scientists actually have--

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and most people don't
even think about this.

01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But our scientists on
Earth, they actually

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
came up with the oneness theory,
and that's the Big Bang Theory.

01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.290 align:middle line:90%
If you think about this.

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:23.592 align:middle line:84%
They say that all matter
originated from a single point.

01:10:23.592 --> 01:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you put your finger
up for me, Jacquelin.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It took as far as
scientists know,

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
14.5 billion years for
that atom and that atom

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.380 align:middle line:90%
to come together again.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But these two atoms,
seemingly different,

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
originated from the
exact same space.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.500 align:middle line:10%
So if you imagine,
not only is it

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:50.320 align:middle line:10%
a physical part that we all
came from the central point

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.380 align:middle line:10%
in the universe to reconnect
again, imagine that singularity

01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:01.200 align:middle line:10%
is also consciousness, and
our consciousness split.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And now it took 14.5
billion years for me

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to meet you in these forms,
same as this atom here

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.288 align:middle line:90%
was in a star, you know?

01:11:12.288 --> 01:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's going back
the other direction.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's sort of happening
at the same time.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's expanding and
contracting at the same time.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's pretty--

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Separating and coming
together for all of eternity,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.830 align:middle line:84%
just trying to figure out what
we are because it's a being

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
that just came into
consciousness saying,

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
what am I.

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
This has been a very
enlightening interview.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.600 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for--

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.240 align:middle line:10%
>> --sharing and--

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.630 align:middle line:10%
>> We really appreciate it.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.380 align:middle line:10%
>> --love to get
this message out.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And thank the mantis beings
for providing an opportunity

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.500 align:middle line:90%
to talk about them a little bit.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:12:14.187 align:middle line:90%
