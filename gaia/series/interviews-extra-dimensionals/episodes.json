She felt a “truth” that could not be denied by her — following her own intuition, the discovery was he was a she within, a female vibration within a male body. A transgender. Coming to grips with this was one of the hardest ideas of self love she could imagine. Only knowing her truth to herself she chose to change here worldly identity to female. Roy died and Roxanne was born.\r\n\r\nWith the guidance from the group leader, she was introduced to channelings from Abraham, Bashar, Kryon, and many others. She was fascinated. Over the next month, Roxie devoured videos and books galore to feed this unknown appetite, leading her to trust her thoughts, heart, self worth.

She was first formally trained as a trance channel by a well known and respected channel in Los Angeles. The approach to her training was psychological in nature, because doctoral candidates at UCLA were studying the process of channeling as it relates to personality integration and development, and her teacher was part of the research program. Because of this approach, and her B.A. in psychology, Lyssa learned channeling from the point-of-view that it could be a tool for spiritual evolution as channels learn to work with their egos so that it would not interfere in the channeling process. This profound method of learning to channel influences the way she teaches the skill today – as a tool for personal and spiritual evolution.","teaser":"Reuben sits down with channeler Lyssa Royal Holt.

After years of feeling unfulfilled and fractured within the religion, Deéte began to feel a sense of entrapment and decided the only way out was suicide. \r\n\r\nShortly after this decision was made she began to have several spiritual awakening experiences, one including contact from her grandmother that had passed away within close proximity to this time. She then continued to have contact from beings from other dimensions, many who had noted they were not of the Earthly dimension.\r\n\r\nDeéte now channels for the deceased and extra dimensional beings in hopes to bring healing, hope, and understanding to the human species. She has three boys who have all expressed seeing angels or connecting with the deceased. Her children’s experiences have been one of validation and reward, indeed one of the greatest drives in her teaching and continuing this work of connecting spirit to the physical.","teaser":"In this episode Reuben travels to Salt Lake City and interviews Deéte, who channels various beings.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/8d5c27d6-064f-4ce0-a6c2-6d48a593daa1?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3b4c7c95-cb43-4a5b-a1db-e6d1afcf0296?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3b4c7c95-cb43-4a5b-a1db-e6d1afcf0296?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3b4c7c95-cb43-4a5b-a1db-e6d1afcf0296?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Deéte, Reuben Langdon"},{"seriesId":181822,"seriesTitle":"Interviews with Extra Dimensionals","seriesPath":"series/interviews-extra-dimensionals","seriesVoteDownCount":378,"seriesVoteUpCount":4738,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/1c7fac14-77b6-42fc-b972-aaef20c0c895?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2019-04-17","episode":21,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/efc6f6e0-8516-4577-b0a9-e54f138956f7?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4f1e454c-5a96-4fd9-a604-591db95452a8?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/ishuwa-yahyel-civilization","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/1c7fac14-77b6-42fc-b972-aaef20c0c895?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":1,"title":"Ishuwa of the Yahyel Civilization","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26926","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Paranormal","weight":0},{"content_id":"207968","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/supernatural","name":"Supernatural","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"207740","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/7-supernatural-rc","name":"7 - Supernatural RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120016","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"seeking-truth","name":"Seeking Truth","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":54,"voteUpCount":300,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":65,"seasonCount":3,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":4051,"mediaId":180779,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":180779,"isFree":false},"id":182365,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"In this interview Shaun Swanson channels Ishuwa of the Yahyel, Reuben asks questions about the Yahyel civilization’s history and what role they have in interacting with humanity.

This has helped her integrate unusual spiritual and psychic experience into realistic application for people from all walks of life. Her work is practical, esoteric, and grounded so that it is applicable into real life. She channels Areon, The Lyran Council of Time. The Lyran messages are full of love and focused on humanity’s Ascension and connecting people with their timeless nature as they move into fourth and fifth dimensional expression.","teaser":"During a trip to Sedona, Reuben connects with energy healer, channel, author, and teacher Jamye Price to learn more about her personal journey and the work she shares with the world.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/cdfe1b87-19ce-4d1a-871b-ded664498e04?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/7ecf2c69-244e-4b4f-addb-3184a8d98292?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/7ecf2c69-244e-4b4f-addb-3184a8d98292?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/7ecf2c69-244e-4b4f-addb-3184a8d98292?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Reuben Langdon, Jamye Price"},{"seriesId":181822,"seriesTitle":"Interviews with Extra Dimensionals","seriesPath":"series/interviews-extra-dimensionals","seriesVoteDownCount":378,"seriesVoteUpCount":4738,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2020-04-27","episode":16,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/f4206d3a-aece-452b-adf1-8318dc87ce67?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/lyran-council-time-channeled-jamye-price","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":2,"title":"The Lyran Council of Time (Channeled by Jamye Price)","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26926","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Paranormal","weight":0},{"content_id":"207968","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/supernatural","name":"Supernatural","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"207740","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/7-supernatural-rc","name":"7 - Supernatural RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120016","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"seeking-truth","name":"Seeking Truth","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":48,"voteUpCount":512,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":65,"seasonCount":3,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":3712,"mediaId":200453,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":200453,"isFree":false},"id":200535,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"In this episode, Jamye Price shares her understanding of, and the various ways she works with, Light Language.

Her empowering work in the field of hypnosis began in 2012, learning from the late Dolores Cannon. Prior to her passing in 2014, Suzanne assisted Dolores with classes and today teaches with her daughter, Julia Cannon, and is the Director of the Global Official QHHT Forum of Practitioners and maintains a busy QHHT practice headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa. In this interview Reuben talks with Suzanne about how she got her journey in the QHHT practice and her wonderful relationship with Delores Cannon. \n\nBeing a long time fan of Dolores’ and referencing her body of work throughout the series, Reuben discovered Suzanne and her work after receiving the “Designer Session” youtube link from a friend, which has Suzanne working with client Beverly Rickard. After  listening to the regression session Reuben quickly reached out to both Suzanne and Beverly to discuss collaboration. A few months later the stars aligned and Reuben & the E.D. crew were able to meet Suzanne & Beverly in Des Moines for a fantastic interview and interaction with “the Designers.” \n\nSuzanne’s other bodies of work in the field of human consciousness include her teachable method of channeling called The Art of Universal Knowing and the guided meditation called The Universal Mind Project. Suzanne feels her life’s calling is to assist others to find their own answers and healing from within. Her desire is to help guide humanity in having a clear and easy connection to the part of themselves that loves unconditionally and has access to their sovereign self.
