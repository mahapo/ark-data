>> If you wish to make an
apple pie from scratch,

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:50.399 align:middle line:84%
you must first
invent the universe.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Lyssa, thank you for
doing this, for coming in.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And you've been in the
scene for quite some time,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:90%
in the channeling scene--

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:90%
many years, many--

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Decades.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Decades.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.832 align:middle line:84%
So how did it how did
it all start for you?

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've told this
a million times but--

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't matter.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It's still an interesting story.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It really started
with a UFO sighting.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
In 1979, I was living
in New Hampshire.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:90%
At the time, I was in college.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people they
can do the math about my age

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
by knowing I was in
college at that time.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was in New
Hampshire, which

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.232 align:middle line:84%
was well-known for a lot
of UFO classic cases,

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
like Betty and Barney
Hill as an example.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it happened
during a snow storm

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
where this very
bright light appeared

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
in the forest across the
street from my house.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It was witnessed by my
family, and it was obviously

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:90%
nothing conventional.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So it really was the thing that
motivated me to find answers.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
At that time in college,
I was studying psychology.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So one of the methods
that I was experimenting

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with in my psychological
studies was self-hypnosis.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So when I would practice
it for my classwork,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that I could
go into a very deep state

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- at this time,
I was not receiving messages,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
but I was sensing things
in a different way.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how the two paths
are starting to come together.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And after I graduated college,
I moved to Los Angeles,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%
about 1983 time period.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was the time when the
New Age movement was really

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
exploding in Los Angeles
with Shirley MacLaine's book,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
"Out on a Limb" primarily.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got
me into the field,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
reading some of these
new books coming out

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and many more UFO sightings
actually in Los Angeles,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:90%
sometimes over the freeway.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And that led
eventually to seeing

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Darryl Anka channel Bashar.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What year was
that when he started?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> When I started, it was 19-

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> With Darryl.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>> With Darryl, it was
probably 1984 or 1985.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh,OK.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So at that time, he was just
doing sessions in a living room

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
for 10 people.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.497 align:middle line:90%
So it was really like--

00:04:00.497 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> And you got in on that?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I got in on that.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going two to
three times a week.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bashar really
became my mentor.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And when the channeling
started to happen,

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
he helped to guide me as well.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The channeling itself started
because I had a dream.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream,
a boy from India

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
appeared, touched my
chakras, and said,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:90%
you will be a channel.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I woke up, it was
a little bit freaky because I

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
knew what a channel was,
obviously, but I thought,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
how in the world is that
going to happen for me?

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't really pursue it.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It kind of pursued me, which
was really interesting.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's the very beginnings.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And then did you start
channeling publicly soon

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
after that, or
did you just start

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
how Darryl started, doing
the living room thing?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was actually
a little bit of both.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I started with friends first,
but very often as a channel,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:90%
you need--

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
at least I needed further
guidance and a mentorship.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So Darryl's wife actually,
Erica, called me one day

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and said that a
woman in Los Angeles

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:90%
was giving a channeling class.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
There was one more space,
and she signed me up for it.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was really the
universe pushing me.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So the class was 10 people,
and we eventually whittled down

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to five in the '80s, and we
practiced together for a year.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.023 align:middle line:84%
We called ourselves the Channel
Panel actually, in 1985.

00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:38.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Channel
Panel has a history.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The Channel
Panel has a history.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.735 align:middle line:84%
And we started doing public
events as a five group.

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And who was all in the
five, if you don't mind--

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't mind saying, but--

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --if you even
remember everybody.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --I don't think anyone or--

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe just a few are
doing publicly now.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.433 align:middle line:90%
There was Darryl's wife, Erica.

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
She'll probably kill
me for saying that.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%
She channeled too?

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.835 align:middle line:84%
>> She was channeling a
Sirius being at the time.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And a woman named Pam
and a man named Bruce--

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
who knew Darryl from the
special effects industry--

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and a man named Steven, who
lives, I think, in Hawaii now,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and then me.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And obviously you're
still doing it.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Darryl's still doing it.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you know-- have you kept in
touch with anybody else or--

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm still in
touch with Darryl and--

00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:31.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --his wife, Erica, of course.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
My friend Pam, we communicate
a little bit and a little bit

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:90%
with Steven.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
We've all gone off in
our own directions,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but the bond we have I
think is still there.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very strong.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a really
important time in my life.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the process of
channeling, how does it--

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
in these I'm, I guess,
thinking about the others who

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:90%
no longer do it publicly.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
that you have to--

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
in a public setting,
we see the breathing

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.282 align:middle line:90%
or whatever your process is.

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we'll get
into that later.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But how did you carry that
into your daily life, I guess?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, especially those
who no longer channel publicly,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:84%
do they still, on this side at
home, do they channel or what?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think our background
was really unique as channels

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
because there's a little
bit of a lineage here.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And it might seem like
I'm taking a tangent,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
but the person who trained
Darryl was like the grandfather

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:90%
we see.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a man named Thomas Ari.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, he
was channeling Seth.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:90%
This is after Jane Roberts?

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So this was still maybe
late '70s, early '80s now.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And then Darryl
studied with him.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher, Sean Randall,
studied also under Tom.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they birthed
us, so to speak,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's kind of this
lineage that happened.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But the really cool
thing is that at the time

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I was training, there
was a woman at UCLA

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:90%
who was studying--

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
she was getting her
doctorate, and she

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
was studying the effect of
channeling on the channel, him

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
or herself, and what
happens to the consciousness

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
over long periods of time if
you work with clearing the ego

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and you really work with seeing
channeling as a way to evolve

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
yourself as a human being.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.972 align:middle line:84%
So they were studying
this at UCLA,

00:08:53.972 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was part
of her doctorate.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
That's-- wow.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And her theory was that--

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of course, Darryl was one of
the subjects of the study.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So her theory was
that if we continue

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to go through our lives
as channels, continuing

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to be devoted to our
own growth, the entities

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and the human being
can begin to blend.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, Darryl
channels his future self.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beings I channel,
Sasha, is a future self of me.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:90%
So the theory was--

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.867 align:middle line:90%
>> That seems to be a theme.

00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It seems to be a theme.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:31.024 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Not all the time but--

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it's
an important theme.

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
that later because it

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
evolution of humankind

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and things such as that.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But so the idea was
that over a lifetime,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
if the energies can
begin to integrate,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
then we're really ushering in
a new level of consciousness

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of integrated consciousness
into the human collective.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
professor died very shortly

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:84%
after her dissertation,
so she couldn't really

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
see through the end of her--

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems in the '80s,
when Darryl and--

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
did Abraham come on the
scene around that time too?

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it was after that.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> After that.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Or I wasn't aware of--

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mentioned the study,
and from what I have been

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:90%
looking back--

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
at that time, I was
oblivious to all this work.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have Ramtha and others
that came onto the scene.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there
was a big push for it,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and then it sort of fell
away in the '90s, 2000s.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Any ideas?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Speculations?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I only have my own theories.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
That time period of the early
to mid-80s seemed to be a nexus

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
point almost in our history
where we made a shift into more

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual
perspective and maybe--

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Would this be the
harmonic convergence?

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was around the
harmonic convergence time.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
during that time,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
though, you have, in a sense
the other polarity or pole of it

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.015 align:middle line:84%
where you had a lot of the
negative stories about Ramtha

00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:90%
and about channeling.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And those negative
stories really seeded.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, I had personal
experience with Ramtha and--

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I haven't, so I--

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so it's--

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:90%
I won't get into it now.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't publicly said
this too much, but I've had--

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
my mother was involved
with the Ramtha thing.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was a young
age in high school,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and it really turned my life
in a negative direction.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.452 align:middle line:90%
So I was very against it.

00:11:57.452 --> 00:11:59.535 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I'm doing
this now-- it's very--

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, It's
very interesting.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Full circle.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.615 align:middle line:84%
And even my mother, she
got out of the whole Ramtha

00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:90%
thing and everything.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
But she's got PTSD--

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I can imagine.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.375 align:middle line:84%
>> --from that experience, and
it's hard for her to even watch

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:14.175 align:middle line:90%
my videos--

00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:14.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --because of the PTSD
from that whole thing.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
She's still very spiritual
and open to a lot of stuff.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, she says
it's hard for her

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to revisit, to go watch people
who go into those channels

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
too because of her negative
experiences with that.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the opening
that happened so profoundly,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people were trying
channeling or were opening

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the channeling, but
they didn't have--

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I just feel so fortunate
for the training

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I had because most
channels don't

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
get the training
of clearing the ego

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and working on the
deep inner levels

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
channeling becomes

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
a process of integration rather
than fragmentation where you're

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
channeling inner
voices, perhaps,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
more so than the
energies coming through.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know there was a
lot of also, at that time,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:84%
channels who created
a lot of chaos and--

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --cult energies--

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> --and that added to the
perception of channeling.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the channelers
that I've been interviewing

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
for the series and
come in contact with--

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely being guided--

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.265 align:middle line:90%
but I've found my key--

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use this
term, but my BS meter--

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I have one, too.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is-- and this
is just for me personally,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:90%
but it seems to work.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:53.005 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody's speaking
about separation or unity,

00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
that's the key thing.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it unity or separation?

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
in the course

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of the information that's being
channeled or coming through--

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
if it talks about unity and
if it's all about unity,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:84%
then that tends to be the ones
that I focus on in my series.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole separation
and idea of separation

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and putting barriers and
all these things, so--

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I agree, 100%.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And for those
who are watching,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe you use that as a
discernment tool for--

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very subtle because
there's some material also that

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
claims to be talking about unity
but is really just facilitating

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:90%
separation.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a tricky game.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a good growth
lesson for everyone, really.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I say BS, not that
the people that are actually

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
channeling are
actually making it up.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They just might be
tapping into entities

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that may not be of
the best interest

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:90%
for humanities evolution.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Or they haven't
processed themselves enough,

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and when the energy comes
through, it can distort.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, have you come across
anybody that, because of that,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
able to process,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:84%
are they actually
bringing in energies,

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:90%
matching frequency so to say?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So if their frequency,
if their ego is still

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
more involved in that process,
do they channel entities

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
with egos that are
involved with that, just--

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a wonderful--

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --or is it them??

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a wonderful
geeky discussion that I really

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm kind of radical
on this because--

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's real easy
for people to say, oh,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a negative entity,
or it's a positive entity.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But I see the human
consciousness more of being

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.128 align:middle line:84%
like a filter, and we attract
the same frequency that

00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
we're running, basically.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I see it.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you are conspiratorial
and you're into more

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
of the separation thing, then
the channeling that is coming

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:84%
through you is going to really
reflect those belief systems.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Whether that's the entity?

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm more inclined to think it's
the channel, not the entity.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.562 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certainly not
pointing any fingers.

00:16:17.562 --> 00:16:18.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:18.362 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have our own
processing we need to do.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%
So I've been told--

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say this-- but when my
mom was involved in the Ramtha

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
thing, the idea that
helped her break

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
free from being
in that situation

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
was that another entity came
through and was doing things

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that-- so the original
Ramtha energy that was there

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
fell to the side.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And then another energy
came through that,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:90%
claimed to be the same entity.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
So I've heard different takes.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I've heard that too.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> But I like that take.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems to make, on a logical,
grounded earth level it seems

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:90%
like that's--

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you
think about it,

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:84%
those of us that are doing
channeling work or any type

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual teaching work,
even the ancient scriptures,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Hindu scriptures,
say this, that you get tested.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And you get very
big challenges when

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you're doing this kind of
work, and you basically

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
move to the next level
of your evolution

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
if you can move through those
challenges with grace and ease.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the challenges
get bigger and bigger.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.963 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we grow.

00:17:37.963 --> 00:17:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have to
step up to the plate.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And the minute we blame other
people or other entities,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:90%
we've lost the point of--

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So the '80s were this
epic period of channeling.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Epic.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the research
stopped in that sense.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of--

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I heard in Darryl's new movie,
the "First Contact" movie,

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that he actually had somebody
hook up the EKG machine

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.533 align:middle line:90%
to his head.

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And where they doing
that back then or--

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
They were just starting
to do the EKG work then.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But again, even
technology at that time

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.092 align:middle line:84%
was very different
than it is now.

00:18:18.092 --> 00:18:18.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:18.892 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.955 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that people have
been doing the research.

00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't really
quote it very well.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read it.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I do
know about that research

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the
things they've found

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
is that, for instance, if I'm
sitting here talking to you,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:84%
my beta brainwave state
is more active because I'm

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Lyssa in this physical reality.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm channeling,
they've found

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
all the different brainwaves
states heightened.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the entire brain
is in an active and integrative

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I believe
Dr. Oz did a show on this.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:90%
It's on--

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, he did?

00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:90%
--his website.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And what they found--

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I can't, unfortunately,
quote the science,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
but actually, the link is
still up on his website.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But what they found
is that the way

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
the brain is firing when a
person is doing channeling

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is it appears
there's input coming

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
from outside the
person's own brain, which

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
is another kind of validation
for this type of work.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have a theory on
channelers and the channelings.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people, no
matter what, there's 50% of--

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
so there's never fully this
other entity coming through.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There's still, whoever the
channeler is, is there's

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:90%
going to be a 50%--

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I just
pulled that number out.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:90%
But I like to explain to people.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.568 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
get scared, or oh,

00:19:56.568 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:84%
this entity's taking
over their body.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no--

00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> --it's at least 50%.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It's an agreement.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
At least 50% of that
person is coming through.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it could be
even more, depending

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
on how well that
person can channel

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that information through.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.663 align:middle line:84%
But at minimum or
maximum, you're

00:20:19.663 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
going to get 50% of the
other person no matter what.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I agree with that,
and furthermore,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of that has to do
with the evolutionary process

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're involved
with as humans now.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look, for
instance, at Edgar Cayce,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:90%
he would go into a sleep state.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a state of
separation, really.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
That was appropriate for
the early days of mediumship

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and things such as that.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're going into
the stage of integration

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
as a collective
consciousness as human beings

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
where we can no longer maintain
that state of separation.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've come to see
that that form of channeling

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:90%
is very hard on the body.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And so now, in order to
make this evolutionary leap,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
there has to be that
partnership between the energy

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and the human.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So one of your earlier
questions was about,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
how do you integrate
it in your daily life?

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we're doing
our inner work as channels

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
sincerely that the integration
starts happening naturally,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's how our channeling
gets clearer and clearer

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
and deeper and deeper.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:90%
When you channel, do you--

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've seen videos.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes are open.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:90%
You're present or--

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.863 align:middle line:90%
>> When I'm channeling--

00:21:45.863 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you in a
trance completely?

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a trance state.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:90%
What do you--

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to say
completely because I had

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
training in how to walk
and how to drink and things

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:90%
in the channeling state.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can, if you know Lyssa
and then you know the beings

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm channeling, you
can see the difference.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But after 30-something years
now, it's much more fluid.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:90%
So my eyes are closed--

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> They are closed.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --but I do get up and
draw on the board and things.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And they will use my eyes
just slightly like a peep--

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost echo location, like
a dolphin, to find the terrain.

00:22:27.903 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they close
my eyes again.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's
really interesting.

00:22:31.965 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And over the
years, like you said--

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.712 align:middle line:84%
and I've interviewed other
channelers and stuff too.

00:22:36.712 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It does seem-- what you just
said, just to validate--

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that there's less and
less trance channeling,

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.545 align:middle line:84%
deep trance channeling,
and more of a--

00:22:45.545 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
what do they call it?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Conscious--

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Conscious channeling.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.935 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:47.935 --> 00:22:50.725 align:middle line:84%
>> --conscious channeling where
you're sort of there and you

00:22:50.725 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
can sort of hear all the
information that's there--

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that how-- do you hear
what's going on in the moment,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:84%
or do you have to
go back and rewatch?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The best metaphor that
I've used for this is

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Lyssa's talking to you now,
so Lyssa's driving the car.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.943 align:middle line:84%
But my higher self and the
beings are in the back seat.

00:23:07.943 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But when I go into
the channeling state,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Lyssa's going in the back seat
and they're driving the car.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And usually what it
feels like for me

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
is I'm sitting in the back seat,
and I'm looking out the window.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But I can hear their
conversation in the front seat.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is
I can have my own experience

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:90%
in the back seat.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And what is coming out
verbally when I'm channeling

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is about 30% of the
download that I'm getting.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.415 align:middle line:84%
The download itself cannot
be encapsulated into words.

00:23:41.415 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it feels
like my head's

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
going to explode because
it can't all come out.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But experientially, I have
the experience of the download.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed other
entities that talk about--

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.852 align:middle line:84%
and then I ask them, in the
moment, where's your being?

00:23:59.852 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing right now?

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.477 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
well, I'm having

00:24:02.477 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with
my son on my planet

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time, I'm actually

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
being channeled in
another planet over here,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and my consciousness
is over there.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:90%
So a lot's going on.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot's going on.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess I love that
analogy of the front seat

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.965 align:middle line:84%
and back seat where you're
just letting somebody else--

00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
you're there in the car, but
you're just letting somebody

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.260 align:middle line:90%
else drive for a minute.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.752 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, though,
it does feel, for me--

00:24:32.752 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
other channels--

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
my trance state has deepened
in the last six years

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
but not deepened in the Edgar
Cayce way, the separation way.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like going deeper into
the quantum and still being

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
able to come back.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's a sense
of being deeper.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to describe.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe if you just
think you're digesting

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the information-- you're able
to process the information

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
a little bit deeper, so you
have to go deeper to get it?

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I think so.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
it's so intense

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.923 align:middle line:84%
that it's really
exhausting, which

00:25:14.923 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is usually why I try to have
a break when I'm channeling--

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --after an hour
or so just to ground.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I've heard your
channel several beings.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.417 align:middle line:90%
Could you tell us--

00:25:27.417 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I know later we'll probably
get into some of them,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:84%
but could you just tell us, over
the evolution, who came first?

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:90%
How did that all work?

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in the '80s, at the
very beginning when I started--

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:90%
this is common for everyone.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
When I teach channeling,
I tell my students this.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes at the beginning
it's a lot of different ones.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.005 align:middle line:84%
And they might be there
for a short period of time,

00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:52.255 align:middle line:90%
or they might just visit once.

00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The first being I was
channeling regularly

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
for about a three-year
period in the '80s

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:90%
was a being called Radia.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was a collective
consciousness mostly associated

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
with Arcturus, the
star, Arcturus,

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
which is actually one of the
simplest energies to channel.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for humans
to tap into that energy.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Then in '88, I went
through a real shift,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and I had had more
UFO experiences.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's when Sasha came.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Sasha is the female
Pleiadian being

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been channeling since
'88 and who also says she's

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:90%
a future incarnation of me.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But back then, Sasha was
very different than Lyssa,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:90%
personality wise, energy wise.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
They were like opposite
ends of the spectrum.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But remembering the
theory I was telling you

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
about about the
channeling process being

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
an integrative one, I've seen
that her theories were true

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because Sasha and Lyssa
have come closer and closer

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and closer and closer
together to the point

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
now that sometimes
when I'm doing contact

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
work outside at
night in the dark,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
it's like Lyssa and
Sasha become one,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know where
one ends and one begins.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Not in a state of
schizophrenia though, however.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So but that in a positive
way, in a positive sense then.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> In a positive way.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
In an amazingly positive way
that is helping me as a human,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, become a
better human being.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's that Sasha, and her
focus tends to be on the--

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
some people use
the term ascension.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't use that term, but
the shift in consciousness

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
that humans are going through.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
She also is really strong
on the whole contact

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:84%
issue, which is her love and
one of the main reasons why

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:90%
she's here.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there is
another collective.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
He calls himself--

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I say he.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:90%
He's not a he nor she--

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
collective called
Germane-- not St. Germain.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Spelled G-E-R-M-A-N-E because
it's the English word meaning

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:90%
coming from the same source.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he
chose that name,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to show that he's coming
from the same source.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the way to
describe his collective

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
is that if our entire
galactic family

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
went through their
shift, their ascension,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:84%
moving back to the one,
and became a collective,

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
it's the energy of
that collective.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you say
galactic family,

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
the galactic family that we're
familiar with, the Arcturians,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadians--

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say mostly the
ones we're familiar with,

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
but many of those we're
not familiar with too.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So that energy, Germane,
he says many people

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
tap into it on the planet
by different names.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because I interviewed
Micheila Sheldon.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:90%
She channels a group.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:90%
She described it similarly.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Council of
Light that is a collective

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:84%
of collectives, so to say, and
it was very galactic and it's--

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
When you get up
there, there's not

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that many collectives
left because everybody's

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Going to the source.

00:29:16.198 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you mentioned--

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you channel
Calvin the Mantis being

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned a Yahyel
being came through recently.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Does it just happen
on the fly or--

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It usually
happens on the fly.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It often happens when I'm doing
a contact work, in general,

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.910 align:middle line:84%
because we're focusing on that
issue of galactic energies.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
There is one being who's a
Sirian ambassador named Hamóne.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of like the big wig,
and when he comes it's like,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:90%
everybody shut up.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We joke with him, but
he's very well-respected.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's been working
a lot, especially

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
with my students in
Japan about opening--

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
the integration of the
mental-emotional bodies

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and moving into the quantum
states of consciousness.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And then as you mentioned,
there was-- only once--

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
the Mantis being, Kelvin, who
came during a contact retreat

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
where the temperature dropped
about 10 or 15 degrees when

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:90%
he was channeling.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And recently-- big
surprise to me--

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:90%
a Yahyel being came.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
In the past, I had
channeled Essassani,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and I had channeled Bashar.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Darryl knows about that.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Every once in a while.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But the Essassani
energy is unmistakable.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So recently, there was a
woman in the audience who

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
asked about the Yahyel
beings, and I could feel--

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to describe, but
it's like you can feel it

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:90%
coming at you like a torpedo.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a torpedo.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --and especially
Essassani, hybrid.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Yahyel's a
very similar frequency.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Very similar frequency.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very short
message, but I felt it coming.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, my
training as a channel

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is to always watch internally
my response to the energy.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Am I resisting it?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:90%
If I'm resisting it, relax.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Surrender.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Am I blocking it?

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Is there fear because I
don't want to hear something?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to constantly
always watch our ego.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm juggling things
in the back seat

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of the car at the same time.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, the Yahyel--

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because somebody's getting
in the back of your car.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
over the driving.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's like,
I know this energy.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's so intense.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trained at this point to
know that even if I resist it,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:90%
let go.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I let go and
the energy came through.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you're hearing it, it
sounds Essassani in some ways.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the Yahyel
channels that I've--

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --that I've come
across with it,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and they use the same four or
five laws of the universe--

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.835 align:middle line:90%
the Bashar.

00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> They repeat them verbatim--

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --all the time.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:20.770 align:middle line:90%
All is the one.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
One is all.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You exist.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.272 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything about it.

00:32:25.272 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.670 align:middle line:84%
What you put it in
is what you put out.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:84%
The whole-- and everything
changes except for those laws.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Those things.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't honestly listen to
a lot of other channels--

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
not because I don't want
to be tainted, but I just--

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
that's work for me, so I don't.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not my relaxing activity
to listen to other channels.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you have
a direct line, why?

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Especially to all
the numerous ones

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that you seem to
be tapping into.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know other people
that channel Yahyel that it

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
sounds like that.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize it.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Very, very similar.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Very similar.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I because I'm-- as I
was saying yesterday--

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to put together
a glossary or thesaurus,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:84%
encyclopedia of all of the
different energies out there.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this series is.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So I've been paying
attention and looking

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
at the little nuances
and trying to find--

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So the hybrid races--

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious to find more
about the other hybrid races

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
because we really only
know about the Essassani

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and the Yahyel.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> There is all kinds.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the contact
work, we come across--

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:90%
maybe I've channeled them.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember-- like
a Pleiadian-Zeta hybrid

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:90%
or a Pleiadian-Sirian hybrid.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, those are
just the species we know.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Right and Treb
from Rob Gauthier,

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
he's a reptilian-human hybrid
and created by Pleiadian-human

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:90%
hybrids.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like everything's a hybrid.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask this-- and
I might ask this later

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in the channeling as
well-- but would you

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:84%
say the whole
hybridization thing,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:84%
is that part of the process
of going back to the oneness?

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Spot on.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Sasha has said many times that
from the human perspective,

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing this
as, oh, my God.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:90%
We're Guinea pigs.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But she said, what you don't
realize is that it's natural.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Look it.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You're Italian-- speaking
of myself-- you're Italian.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.320 align:middle line:90%
You're Native American.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:90%
You're a hybrid.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's natural.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing to worry about.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So in one spectrum, we
all separated and created

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:84%
our different species with
this unique uniqueness

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:84%
but on the other end,
almost simultaneously,

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:57.239 align:middle line:84%
we're all hybridized, coming
together and going back into--

00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And our view of seeing this
hybridization happening is

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:90%
the linear view of a human ego.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But from the quantum
view, we're already--

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Entangled.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> --together.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Entangled.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you do a
lot of work in Japan,

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and we've talked about this.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And Japan's a dear
place in my heart.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain to--

00:35:25.952 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
because this is probably
not just the Japan audience.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.702 align:middle line:84%
This is more of an
American audience.

00:35:29.702 --> 00:35:30.895 align:middle line:90%
What do you do out there?

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You go out there all the time,
at least two times a year,

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:90%
four times a year.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I am out in Japan all the time.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I started there in 1990,
and right now the work

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:90%
has really accelerated.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It seems that all my new work
is birthed in Japan first.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't necessarily know why.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going with it.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But I have a
channeling class there

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that I work with
for a whole year,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and I give them homework
between the segments.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So the students are amazing.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:84%
They're so dedicated
and so excited,

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and they humble me all the time
by watching their sincerity.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, every summer
I do a contact retreat

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Fuji, which is one
of the highlights for me--

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:22.875 align:middle line:90%
--of the year.

00:36:22.875 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.005 align:middle line:90%
It's a powerful spot.

00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and we have a
lot of repeat students.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, the
energy's really building.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have amazing contact
experiences that happen there.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot of private
sessions, regular workshops,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.113 align:middle line:84%
retreats, and, of course,
the channeling class there.

00:36:40.113 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you offer that kind of
work here in the States as well

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:90%
or?

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:84%
We have a yearly contact retreat
here in Arizona, usually,

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:90%
usually in October every year.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And I do some private
sessions by Skype,

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.590 align:middle line:84%
but again, because I'm in Japan
so much, I have to space things

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a lot of space,
unfortunately, in the States

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in my schedule to do work.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So here and there.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Here and there.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've written
a number of books.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.180 align:middle line:84%
If someone wanted to get
more familiar with your work,

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.595 align:middle line:90%
how would you recommend--

00:37:16.595 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:90%
a book to start with or--

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The first book, the classic
book, is "The Prism of Lyra,"

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:90%
which I channeled in 1989.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I channeled
that book, basically,

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.890 align:middle line:84%
was because in the '80s, I
would go into the Bodhi Tree

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.350 align:middle line:90%
bookstore in Los Angeles--

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I would want
channeled information

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:90%
about our galactic family.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And there were zero books
on the shelf at that time,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and I really was hungry to
get the answers to that.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I channeled the
information, never thinking

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
it would be considered
such a classic book now,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So "The Prism of Lyra"
would be the first book

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
about the galactic
family, and that led to--

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
we're still in the '80s now,
and the abduction phenomenon

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And Whitley Strieber's book
had come out, "Communion."

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And to make the story
short, I had this experience

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:84%
where even I got sucked into
the fear thing about it.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in
Los Angeles one day,

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and I was in the shower.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was mentally ranting at
those guys for taking humans.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I had soap all over me, and
suddenly the water shut off.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I received the
communication saying,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.160 align:middle line:84%
do you really want
to know our story?

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.265 align:middle line:90%
We'll tell you.

00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And that became the book
"Visitors From Within."

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's from Zeta beings?

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, from Zeta beings.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Bashar has some information
in there and Sasha too.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
Zeta beings in there.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about that idea, in
the bigger picture, rather than

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
the victim and perpetrator idea,
more about species evolution.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, a lot a lot of people
were getting into the fear.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Whitley, too.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his experiences
were pretty terrifying.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Budd
Hopkins and, luckily,

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
John Mack started trying to pull
it back to a more positive--

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Dear John Mack--

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --direction.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what happened.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So then, the natural progression
is going from lying in your bed

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and being taken to the
question, can we, as humans,

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:84%
be active participants
in the contact program?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And that really became my
obsession in the early '90s.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So I channeled the book,
mostly from Sasha, "Preparing

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:84%
for Contact," which, for me, is
my favorite book just because I

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:90%
love the subject matter.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And the book came out, I think,
in late '93 or early '94.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then coincidentally,
I met Dr. Steven Greer

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:07.610 align:middle line:84%
at that time, who was just
getting going with CSETI.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And through all these
synchronicities,

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I ended up being trained
in his protocol and leading

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:90%
groups in his protocol.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And those were
wonderful years for me.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But then I found I needed
to go in my own direction

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:90%
because I had the direct line.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And Sasha was
giving me protocols,

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and we were doing experiments.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So I have tremendous respect
for what they've done,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
but I just took
a different path.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You were sort of in
the pioneer group then.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.607 align:middle line:84%
Back then, there were only
maybe three or four working

00:40:40.607 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:90%
groups in the whole world.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It was really exciting.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I just saw on Facebook,
I think yesterday or the day

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.937 align:middle line:84%
before yesterday, was an
anniversary for CSETI and with

00:40:50.937 --> 00:40:53.354 align:middle line:84%
all the work-- and there's so
many Facebook pages now with

00:40:53.354 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:90%
all these different people.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.570 align:middle line:84%
To imagine back then that it
would be this widespread now,

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:90%
I could not have imagined it.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It's so gratifying to see.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want Dr. Greer's
job, that's for sure.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
He goes charging forward
with everything blazing.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
That's not my style.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So after that-- and there's
a few books in Japan

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
actually that are
not in English.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
recent thing, though,

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:84%
is really exciting
for me because I

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was getting a lot of questions
from clients who wanted

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.390 align:middle line:90%
to know their galactic history.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.258 align:middle line:84%
And I would go into
the channeling state,

00:41:41.258 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and I would channel
that information.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But I found it was like going
into a really long tunnel.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It was an exhausting process.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And every time I would do
those types of sessions,

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.452 align:middle line:90%
I would really be drained.

00:41:56.452 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, would that be something
like going into the Akashic

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:90%
records in a way, or is that--

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard some people talk
about going into the Akash

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and finding people's histories.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess, because it was
more than just the data.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It was also looking at the
bigger multidimensional quantum

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
picture of how all these
lifetimes fit together

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and why you're here now also
living that matrix of all

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:90%
of those lifetimes.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So in 2010, the collective being
I channeled, called Germane,

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:90%
gave me the directive--

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:84%
inspired by the company
I work for in Japan,

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:84%
who were pushing me to do
it-- to create a set of cards.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
Galactic Heritage cards.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It's 108 cards that
moved from card one

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to card 108 that moved from
the original separation

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.470 align:middle line:84%
all the way through the
deepest separation and polarity

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and back to reunification
and integration.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the energy of the deck.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So now if I work
with people who want

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that information about
their galactic heritage,

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the cards are a way
to jump start it

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.290 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to go deep
into that tunnel that's

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:90%
so exhausting.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.105 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's actually led me
to go deeper with the galactic

00:43:26.105 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:90%
heritage information.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's kind of
like a shortcut--

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:28.975 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a shortcut.

00:43:28.975 --> 00:43:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --using the cards.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Like your metaphor, it's the
Mac one-click instead of click.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead of the PC version.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The PC version.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Several, several clicks.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.442 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.442 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:84%
In working with so many
individuals from Japan

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and America, do you
find a difference

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:90%
in their galactic heritage?

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:58.463 align:middle line:84%
Is there a link up, or is it
all just all over the place?

00:43:58.463 --> 00:43:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess what I'm trying
to ask then is we as races,

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in our DNA are we more prone
to have a particular galactic

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:84%
family base or is it
just doesn't matter?

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
all over the place.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.688 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
I was talking

00:44:18.688 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to Barbara Lam about
the other night,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.390 align:middle line:84%
actually, that she
found very surprising.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And you might find
this really surprising.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The perspective about the
Zetas from the Japanese

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is totally different than
the Western perspective,

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if I talk about
Zetas or channel about Zetas,

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:48.120 align:middle line:84%
their hearts open, and
they love the Zetas.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And I started to notice--

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:84%
now that I've been working
in Japan for 26 years--

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I started to notice, why
aren't there abduction stories?

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:02.100 align:middle line:84%
There are very, very few
abduction stories in Japan.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> In Japan.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And I have theories
for this, but these days,

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about the
Zetas, they are in love with

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.220 align:middle line:90%
the Zetas.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot
of cultural similarities

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.290 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of not
showing emotion.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.525 align:middle line:84%
>> So they feel a really
strong kinship with the Zetas.

00:45:24.525 --> 00:45:25.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's really fascinating.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I've always felt that.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I've always felt--

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:27.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, me too.

00:45:27.632 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --more of a kinship.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.695 align:middle line:90%
>> But, yes, fascinating.

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:90%
When I go there next time--

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going there in a week,
so I'll ask some questions

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to
that a little bit more.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I wasn't really
into it when I lived in Japan.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't into the
ET stuff so much.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I liked science fiction,
and I liked aliens.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But I never-- not like now
but I was really into it.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless it's just my
group that's like a bubble.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.155 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:56.155 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you'll tell me.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I mean, when I was
doing the Citizen Hearing,

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I reached out to some
researchers in Japan to see

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.600 align:middle line:84%
if they would be interested
in being part of the hearings.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And during my research
and trying to find people,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I did notice there was less
of a fear-based when it came--

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people just laugh
it off, the, I guess,

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.970 align:middle line:84%
nonbelievers just
sort of laugh it off.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:28.435 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't the
abductee category.

00:46:28.435 --> 00:46:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It was more of an
experiencer category.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So now that
you're saying this--

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm thinking about it.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.830 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
look into that one.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, look forward to getting
into some channeling later

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and diving into talking to Sasha
and whoever else wants to come

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for all your
work over the years.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just love
having you do this,

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
having this opportunity
to be able to talk

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to you in this manner and just
to continue to do your work.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for doing your work,

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:90%
because this is a huge service--

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --without the fear base
that you're providing.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.390 align:middle line:90%
