00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So what are you doing again?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You're falling
from how high now?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know, actually.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> 14,000 feet, I think.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.122 align:middle line:90%
>> 14,000?

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that where we're going?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, about
120 miles an hour.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:01:38.736 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:39.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, guys.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun.

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo-hoo!

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Miss Georgia Jean.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, should we get
some channeling going?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Bring in the Circle?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Bring in the Circle, yeah.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.698 align:middle line:84%
And I know I don't
need to explain.

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And just for our audience,
where do you go when they come

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:10%
in?

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a conscious channel.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
So I will be--

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.212 align:middle line:90%
I'll be present.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I might be trying to
put my two bits in, and they

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:90%
won't.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Or they will, if at some point.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
So I'm listening.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:10%
But will I remember all of it?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.375 align:middle line:10%
It's usually when I go
back and listen to it.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:10%
Then I'll be like, oh, yeah.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.738 align:middle line:10%
They said this or that.

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say, put your
two bits in, what do you mean

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:90%
by that?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Just when the
material comes up,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.382 align:middle line:84%
I might be in there thinking,
oh, you should talk about this.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:33.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, no.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> They won't.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> This is more important.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
They keep it very
pure in their way.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, looking forward to it.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So I'll bring them in.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we go.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.325 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:50.125 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, dear ones, we are here.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And we are most delighted
to make connection

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with you here on another
magnificent day in your Earth

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:84%
We're very pleased to
be joining you today,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Reuben, as you are disseminating
so many wonderful frequencies

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
out into the world, not
just through this portal,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
but in absorbing the
frequencies yourself

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and then being out in the world
as the individual you are.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So we are most pleased with
your participation in this.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.033 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's a
cocreative process.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Indeed, dear one, indeed.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for using Georgia
here as a channel and coming

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:90%
through in this way in fashion.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
We are most pleased.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is something we sort
of talked about the other day

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:90%
during the podcast.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But for those who
may not have seen it,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
just to give our audience a
little bit of an idea of who

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
the Circle of Light is-- or
what is the Circle of Light?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the series, I go in
and I interview collectives.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I interview
individual beings that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
are maybe on a
higher dimensional

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:90%
plane, space aliens, angels.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Fairies even come in.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So just to give from
your perspective,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
from Georgia's perspective,
what is the Circle of Light?

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Who are the Circle of Light?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are all
of that and more.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All the fairies, the aliens?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> We are all consciousness.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We are all consciousness,
which includes all of that.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But as we address
certain people,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
we may stream one of those
energies more strongly based

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
on where the question of
origin is coming from.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody has a
lot of fairy energy,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
then the fairy consciousness
may amplify through.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, Georgia as a
channel has the capacity

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to channel a broad spectrum of
flavors of energy in this way.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:90%
But she may not channel them.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
She may not be able to interpret
the information as specifically

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
as some of your
other channels who

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
are very attuned to a stronger
single stream, for example,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
a more individual entity or
a very specific collective

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
that they're always channeling.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:90%
But Georgia can do the range.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
nonspecificity, if you will,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
of what comes through Georgia
is simply that the work that--

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
the piece that comes
through Georgia

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is to bring the listeners and
the attendees, the cocreators

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
back into all consciousness.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So to smooth the
edges a little bit.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> To smooth the edges, yes,
to release more and more

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
of the form of individuation
that occurs through the egoic

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
framework.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So here talking
to me, and I'm--

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
consider myself this
spacey, intergalactic dude.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We can certainly bring in
more of the galactic stream

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
for you if that is
what you would like.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, we'll see
where the questions go.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:90%
We want to introduce the Circle.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So I won't focus
too much on myself

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:90%
unless the questions go there.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we are
speaking to you now,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
we are often the greeting
party, if you will.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We are coming through as
the most accessible energy

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
for Georgia to channel
quickly and rapidly

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of this sort
of an interview situation.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
When we are visiting
very often, then visitors

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
may be wanting to come
through this gateway.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And the energy will be
more focused and streamed

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and prepared for that
specific interaction

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
or for a number of interactions
that may be happening

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:90%
for a specific upgrade.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to talk about
the creation of reality?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and eventually get
into bending the matrix--

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
but to have to lay the
foundation first and let people

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
What is reality?

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What is reality?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, constant creation, constant
manifestation, but illusion

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and flexible illusion.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So within the all consciousness
was the intelligence to create,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
of course, the
illusion of separation.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And within that became the
possibility, the potentiality,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and the actuality of
bringing consciousness

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
into form for consciousness
to explore itself through--

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> In this manner.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> In this manner.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:90%
So of course, you are us.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%
You are Georgia.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It is all one.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the most deep way,
that is the truth of creation.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So you use the
portal of the egoic

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
construct to separate
off bits of reality

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:84%
so you can have these
sorts of experiences--

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
bits of consciousness
moving into create form

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:90%
to have this experience.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And the egoic construct is a
very powerful piece of creation

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is so
good at blocking out

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
all of the everything via
the illusion of separation

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.825 align:middle line:90%
that it keeps you--

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
or keeps many people,
maybe not so much you

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because you've let your
veils thin a little bit more.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:90%
But it gives you--

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I still have--

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in this.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you want to be,
you're still here in a physical

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
You're still having
this experience.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You are still consciousness
exploring itself

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
through this manifestation
because it's fun.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:10%
And that is really the point
and why we are coming forward

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:10%
or why you are coming forward
to you to say, hey, lighten up,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:10%
everybody.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And have more fun with this.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And realize that
the game of life

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:10%
is to create the
egoic construct,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:10%
plant the seed that
you have the power

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:10%
to deconstruct the
egoic construct,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and have some fun
doing that so you

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:10%
can discover your
power as a creator

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:10%
through the framework
of the egoic construct.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You are all consciousness
now playing the game of life

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:90%
through the egoic construct.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:10%
So you're still able to
experience this beautiful form

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:10%
that you have made, this
beautiful expression

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:10%
of vibration or form designed
with frequency to come

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:10%
into what looks like
physicality, to come into what

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:10%
looks like solid form.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But it is all created through
the frequency of your nature.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:10%
You have created all of this.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So Nikola Tesla's quote--

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:10%
to understand the universe,
you must think in frequency,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:10%
vibration, and energy.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of helps
you get a better wrap

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:90%
around of how this is.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> That's been a key from my
understanding through these

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.047 align:middle line:84%
teachings and through
just quantum physics.

00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And now our science
is really starting

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.838 align:middle line:84%
to ramp up and go that
direction, too, which is nice.

00:10:42.838 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because the frequency
is allowing the technology

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
to become more sophisticated.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So what was unobservable
by technology

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that was built within
the egoic construct that

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
was held at a certain
level of limitation--

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
as that is dissolving,
of course technology

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is going to now match the
vibration of this knowingness

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is more to it than
this 3D reality construct.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And so even as you are
enjoying the concept

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of extradimensional
beings and, quote

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
unquote, "alien
consciousnesses" coming,

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
perhaps arriving--
many dear ones

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
are waiting for the arrivals
of alien consciousness

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to bring technologies that will
advance human consciousness.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, these
manifestations will not

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:10%
become physicalized to
such a broad, collective,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:10%
agreed-upon believe until
more of the frequency

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:10%
of that intelligence
is integrated.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you start getting the
physical manifestations.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, you
get the technologies

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that will, quote unquote,
"advance civilization."

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But this may happen
through an exchange

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:90%
with these intelligents.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But really, primarily,
it's happening

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
because this, quote unquote,
"alien consciousness"

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:90%
is incarnating into you all.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Babies are being born
holding those frequencies.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are an early
arrival, relatively speaking,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
but many more.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:10%
And that is why this
resonates so deeply with you.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:10%
And the attraction is there
because you're already

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:10%
carrying this stream a lot.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
This is what the star
seeds are, obviously.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So anticipate that your advances
in science and in technologies

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and in these things
that will continue

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to make this Earth a wonderful
place to explore consciousness

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
are coming both through
those who are already here,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
through those who are being
born, and through those,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
yes, that will arrive and
be seen and be physicalized.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's the--

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I think we mentioned this
in a podcast as well--

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
the chicken before the
egg, which it's not--

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we will say that
it is frequency first.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Frequency first, yes.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It is frequency first.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But the physicalization
then allows an upgrade

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
in the belief structure
because once-- because seeing

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:90%
is believing.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And believing then
upgrades the frequency.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But believing is
seen first before--

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.055 align:middle line:90%
well, it is that feedback.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a feedback, as you
say, the chicken and the egg.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But we would say the original
chicken is the frequency.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to smile in the
mirror before the mirror smiles

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.395 align:middle line:90%
back at you first.

00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So the initiation
comes first.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.607 align:middle line:84%
>> But that smile-- then
you get the smile back.

00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And then you have that feedback.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you are a
projectional and perception

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That is what the egoic construct
and the chakra system do.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
It projects and
perceives simultaneously.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:10%
And so this is what many
people are a little bit still

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:10%
in some confusion around.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Where's my frequency at?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not creating?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
If I'm being positive, why am
I not creating what I want?

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Because frequency
comes from a lot

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:84%
more than your
thoughts, of course.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And to get back to-- if you
want us to go into this idea

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:90%
of bending the matrix--

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
That's a big topic I
wanted to get to, yes.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:10%
Because simplistically
expressing this is a--

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:10%
if I want something, I can
think it into manifestation,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:10%
into creation.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if that
is not happening?

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
What if my thoughts are
being really positive,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's not coming
into manifestation?

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Because your thoughts are
only a small part of what

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:10%
is emanating in your frequency.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:10%
And there is a lot
that is unconscious

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:10%
that is creating your form.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
You are not consciously
thinking all the time,

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
hey, cells, join up
with one another.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.725 align:middle line:90%
And make this thing.

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And make these bones.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And make these things.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
So you are--

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.105 align:middle line:90%
>> It's on autopilot.

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> --primarily an
unconscious creation.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:10%
But if you want to learn how
to bend the matrix per se,

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:10%
you travel more deeply into what
is creating this unconscious

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:10%
creation.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Why are there species?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Why are there illnesses?

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Why are there countries?

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are there men and women?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%
What is creating all of this?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you are not consciously
thinking about creating

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:90%
all of that all the time.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
what is going on much deeper.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we call the
"grids that create creation."

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things are so
innate to your experience

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't even bother to think
about them as being something

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that you can work
with in order to bend

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
the matrix of your reality,
time and space being

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
some of the most obvious
grids that create creation.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
The egoic construct creates
the illusion of time and space.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Where we are, this
doesn't exist in this way.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And where most of
the extradimensional

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
consciousness you
were thinking of--

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean the Circle.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, where we are
transmitting to you from,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
which is just a level
of consciousness.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
That's it, really.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
We're just sitting in another
level of consciousness.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Time and space are not
operating here in the same way.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But we are able to observe where
your piece of consciousness

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
is seated and now interact
with you in that paradigm,

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
just in the same way as a writer
or director observes a play

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and can step in on the
stage and say, hey,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I see these things need to get
moved around in order for this

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
to work better.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
There's something we
want to drop in here

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very important
piece of understanding how

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and
understanding how

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the mind works, how the
resistance of the mind works.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There are two states that
form comes into manifestation.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
One is manifestation,
and one is knowingness.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing
is really existing

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
except what your physical
senses are now perceiving

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
or what you are
perceiving right now.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know there
is a road down there.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So when you know
in neutral factor

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a road down there,
it will become manifest

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:90%
as you go there.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's sort of the observation
effect but a little bit layered

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
in that, a little more layered
than the observation effect.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So by observational effect--
because you're languaging--

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.925 align:middle line:84%
what we're assuming you mean is
that if you observe something,

00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:24.725 align:middle line:90%
then it--

00:18:24.725 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It becomes real.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It becomes real, yes.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So here's a little
bit of the hiccup

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that many people are struggling
with with manifestation--

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is that when they are in
a lot of positive energy

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.080 align:middle line:84%
about something,
they may be believing

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that they are raising
their vibration

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
to match to something.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But they may be using
some suppressive dynamics

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:90%
to be in that positive state.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So they are not in authenticity
with their frequency.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.338 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:19:03.338 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the integration
of the darkness.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm?

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Integration of
the dark, in a sense,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.752 align:middle line:10%
or the not-so-nice things.

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Or is that throwing
on another tangent?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because you're--
yes, you're going on another

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:90%
tangent.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But you're speaking to,
again, how the mind likes

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
to work in the polarities,
the good and the bad

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and the light and the dark
and all this sort of thing.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, people sort
of think, well, this thing

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.627 align:middle line:90%
is good, and this thing is bad.

00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then what they're
doing, actually,

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is they're staying in
the state of resistance.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind's judgment that
is creating good and bad, light

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:90%
and dark.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And where there is
judgment, there is mind.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And where there is mind,
there is resistance.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And where there is resistance,
there is manifestation.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But there may be resistance
to what you're actually

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
wanting to manifest.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So where there is nonresistance,
the flow of manifestation

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
occurs much more rapidly.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Desired manifestation
or matching frequency

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
manifestation happens
a lot, what you

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.923 align:middle line:90%
might call the "flow state."

00:20:08.923 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything is flowing.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything is happening
because there is--

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Synchronicities.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --a state of nonresistance.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So when people are trying
to work energetically here,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying
to be positive,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
really they might be sending
out a lot of conflicted energy

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
in that mode if
they're being positive

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're using a
suppressive state to do that.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.434 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And being positive,
being sort of like,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I have to get out of
where I am to get to here,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
they're resisting
their now moment.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, there is manifestation.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And there is knowingness.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
If you are resisting your
current manifestation,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
you're staying locked into it,
of course, because there is not

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
a true and authentic knowingness
that this other manifestation

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.930 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
If you are resisting your
current manifestation,

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
you are in a state
of judgment on it.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
a state of judgment,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:90%
you have conflict of mind.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
conflict of mind,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
you have shabby
manifestational results.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Shabby manifestation, yes.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You have conflict-based
results, which is, I am here.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But I want to be there.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
trying to get out

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is, if you're trying
to manifest something,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
to understand.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you have to
understand is, is it manifest?

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it manifest?

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it manifest?

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Or am I in such knowingness that
I know it's down the street?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Because everything else
means it is unmanifest.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And unmanifest means
there is conflict.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There is resistance to
it becoming manifest,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:90%
otherwise it would be manifest.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a bit
of a mind melter.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
It is a bit of a mind bender.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
unpack that for a second.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.325 align:middle line:84%
Everybody should ask themselves,
is what I want manifest?

00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Am I so certain that it will
manifest that it manifests?

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So am I so certain that
the kitchen is there,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that when I walk over
there, it manifests?

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.187 align:middle line:84%
Most people have manifest
their houses to the degree

00:22:47.187 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that they are certain that
when they go to the bathroom,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:90%
the bathroom will be there.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So that is the knowingness.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:90%
The house is manifest.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The knowingness is
the bathroom is there.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Is your million
dollars manifest?

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
For many people who are wanting
prosperity, that is unmanifest.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:90%
So what makes it unmanifest?

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:90%
That is resistance.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And what can be
creating resistance

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:90%
is a number of things.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're really resisting
where you are right now,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
you are just in resistance.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, in resistance
to just life in general.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You're in resistance
to your creative force.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though your
forces may be creating

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
this partial-act manifestation,
this shabby manifestation,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:90%
you are resisting.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> A shitty job, a
bad relationship.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> A shitty job, a
bad relationship,

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
things just not coming through
because there's some resistance

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:90%
in the field there.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's no point in faking
positivity at that point.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Positivity is an
authentic state when there

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:90%
is less and less resistance.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would you say to
someone who has a knowingness

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that everything's going
to be OK, and then--

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.682 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to use
myself as an example.

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:90%
So there's-- I know.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And it may be because I'm having
these interviews all the time.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing my meditations.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But I absolutely know
in my heart of hearts

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.815 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is on
the up spiral of--

00:24:38.815 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And we would agree.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.183 align:middle line:90%
>> --of this--

00:24:41.183 --> 00:24:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Consciousness, yes.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --consciousness, evolution,
free energy technologies,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
contact with ETs, love
and light for the planet.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What is manifest?

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I see in my
reality where I look--

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and maybe this is because I
choose to look at these things.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But I see signs of
this in everything.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:10%
For example, another $2 billion
lawsuit against Monsanto

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:10%
happened this week that--

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:10%
another one.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know this spiral
that's going already.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It started.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:90%
But what is manifest there?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the
disintegration of Monsanto.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But what is
manifest right now?

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, awareness.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:10%
>> So we're playing with your
logic here because there is one

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:10%
of the grids that create
creation which we have named

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:10%
through Georgia is this--

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:10%


00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Toolkit.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the
possibility-impossibility

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%
polarity.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the places that
the egoic mind is very happy

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.682 align:middle line:90%
to keep you stuck.

00:25:52.682 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's possible it's
going to happen.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible it's
going to happen.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:90%
I hope it's going to happen.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I feel hopeless about this.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So you as an advanced
traveler in consciousness

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:84%
can really benefit by
understanding this.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:10%
And we imagine that whoever is
ready for this information is

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:10%
ready for this information.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:10%
This is why we are pulling
you back to, what is manifest?

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind
is saying, it's

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
possible this stuff
is going to happen.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But yet there's still evidence
that it isn't happening.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:90%
That is the impossible side.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:84%
We just want you
to-- because we don't

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
want to rain on your
hopefulness parade.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But we do want you to
understand that staying

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in the polarity of
possibility and impossibility

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:90%
is a mind trap.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It's happy to keep you there.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So a more powerful
way to view this

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is just to take the positive
smear off for a minute and go,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:90%
what is manifest?

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, here what
is manifest is you

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:84%
are on a place that is
sustainable with a variety

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and an abundance of
flowers and trees.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And yes, this is--

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Solar panels, water
collection systems.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Solar panel--
that is manifest.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
That is truth pimpling.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:10%
Here is the frequency that you
are sitting at in that hope.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
When you think of the
whole world right now--

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, this is
the whole wide world.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But even as you begin to talk
about this company, Monsanto--

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and there is a lawsuit.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in the framework of
that story, what you want

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.403 align:middle line:90%
is not manifest.

00:27:39.403 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I see what you're saying.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> The hope is there.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So almost in that story,
I'm creating the polarity.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we want you to
understand is the egoic mind is

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:84%
always trying to
create polarity.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to bend your
matrix here a little bit,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
you have to get a
little bit cleverer,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
way, than the egoic mind.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And be aware when it is
keeping you in its Storyville.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:90%
So using this story of--

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
in the timeline of
your imagination,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderful now that
there is a lawsuit.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And now there is--

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Stores that are not
carrying glyphosate material.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does
that mean to you?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It just means that
there is a huge awareness.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.307 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does
that mean to you?

00:28:40.307 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is that a good thing?

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I have a compassion
and feeling for humanity,

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.573 align:middle line:90%
for this planet.

00:28:51.573 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I love the saying, where
we go one, we go all.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.272 align:middle line:90%
This is all conscious.

00:28:56.272 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> This is all consciousness.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And even though I may want to--

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I can move out here to
Hawaii and be this myself

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and do this myself.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:90%
But I have this drive that--

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So what that means to
you is that you become all

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Become all
consciousness, meaning--

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:10%
>> So we're just fast
forwarding you to your meaning

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:10%
because your mind has created
this big story about Monsanto.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:10%
And we don't-- because
again, it is real.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.422 align:middle line:90%
It is manifest.

00:29:27.422 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But we don't
want to take sides.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
beat Monsanto down.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, just come with us
here on how we perceive it.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So as you were
describing that, what

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
we see is your mind is
saying that while Mon--

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to paraphrase
it and simplify it.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So part of your mind might want
to resist what we're saying.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But the story of Monsanto
is creating separation

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:84%
from humanity
being able to enjoy

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:84%
all of this all at
once all together.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
This is all consciousness.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto is your
storyline for you

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to attain all consciousness.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, agreed.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you move into your
own consciousness more fully,

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:90%
this story will fall away.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
There's your chicken
and the egg-- frequency

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:90%
first, manifestation.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.945 align:middle line:84%
For you, this
story is important.

00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%
This story has [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.528 align:middle line:84%
>> It's less
important than it was.

00:30:26.528 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I used to go to marches.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.585 align:middle line:90%
And I used to do all that.

00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:29.543 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's all fine.

00:30:29.543 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that there won't
be action in physical lives

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.450 align:middle line:84%
because that's part of
the story of humanity.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not trying to negate--

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that is part of the
creative act of life.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But what we want
you to understand

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is that you can go on all
the marches that you want.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But if the frequency is
remaining in polarity,

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you will experience
more futility on that.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And most people who are
passionate about some story,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it is to heal
from cancer, whether it

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is to have a wonderful
relationship, whether it is

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
to bring food to all the
people, whatever it is,

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
it is the charge of that story
and of that exploration that

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
brings them closer to the all
consciousness, that brings them

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:90%
into a unified state.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Because first the
story of conflict

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:84%
comes in whichever way--
body conflict, relationship

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:90%
conflict, conflict at work.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody usually starts their
spiritual journey going,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
everything is great, and
there is no conflict.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's funny.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Going back to the "Avengers,"
I was just aware watching.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:10%
I was like, there's so much
conflict in this story.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And us humans, we
flocked to the theaters

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.877 align:middle line:84%
to see all the action
and the conflict

00:31:47.877 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:90%
and the fights and the beatings.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:49.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:49.332 --> 00:31:50.207 align:middle line:90%
You love the stories.

00:31:50.207 --> 00:31:52.332 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm an action man
and love the martial arts.

00:31:52.332 --> 00:31:53.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:53.132 --> 00:31:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with this.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.195 align:middle line:10%
But even me, sitting
here, I'm like--

00:31:57.195 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:10%
>> But if you want
to bend the matrix--

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm like, I think this is not
how this is going to get done.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But yet it's so enticing for
the audience, for the human--

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.730 align:middle line:90%
why do humans love the conflict?

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you are really all
consciousness who is so clever

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that it created the illusion of
separation so you could explore

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:90%
But that conflict--

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.803 align:middle line:90%
>> That's why you love it.

00:32:21.803 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --story has been
told so many times.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:90%
It has been told so many times.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's always going to
be some resistance in reality

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
you have reality.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Right now this chair is
resisting being Georgia.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
There's always going
to be some resistance.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And here's something that's
really "ding" for you

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love the conflict
a little bit because it actually

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:84%
has the capacity
to create reality--

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, to move us.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --then you are, again,
staying in a massive state

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of resistance because then
you're resisting everything.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So ironically, if
you will, you are

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to move into all
consciousness, unity with all.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But part of that process
is to love the conflict--

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, love the drama.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> --the very thing that
is creating the separation.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Because as all consciousness,
you created that.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to keep
having your stories.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what I'm hearing?

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like, you're
damned if you do,

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:22.615 align:middle line:90%
you're damned if you don't.

00:33:22.615 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is your
mind's interpretation.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Why are you damned if
you love the conflict?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the energy in
the conflict which is what

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
you want to integrate to come
to the all consciousness.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.847 align:middle line:84%
If you stay in your
resistance state,

00:33:36.847 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to keep
getting the resistance.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:90%
You're not damned if you do.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:90%
It's quite the opposite.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I was joking.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:90%
We understand, yes.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't want
your listeners

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:90%
to feel a drop of energy there.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to come back to
your question about how

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to bend the matrix because
this is what we really

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:84%
want your ever-expanding
consciousnesses to receive.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to is it
manifest or isn't it--

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
because one of the biggest
tricks the mind will do

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:84%
will keep your just away
from that simple question.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%
Is it manifest, or isn't it?

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:84%
It'll keep you in the stories
of why does it manifest

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:90%
or this or that or the other.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It will keep you in--

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and we don't want to make fun.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But it'll keep you
in the Monsanto court

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:29.350 align:middle line:84%
case for all eternity
if it can keep you out

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:90%
of all consciousness.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So it wants to keep
you in the story.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is where you now--

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
not only as mind, but
as witness of mind,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:84%
which is your next
level of consciousness--

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.420 align:middle line:84%
have to pull the reins
on the storytelling pony.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Pull it in and just ask
yourself this question.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it manifest, or isn't it?

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you've
answered that question,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, you can start
looking for reasons

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:90%
why it is unmanifest.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:06.111 align:middle line:84%
But you don't look for
reasons to get into the--

00:35:06.111 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> To create more story.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --to be in the story,
in the mind's trick.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:90%
You go, all right.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:90%
So if we say to you--

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
because your mind is basically
going, when Monsanto goes away,

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and they lose, and everyone
will have food, something

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:84%
along these lines,
everyone will have access

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to this wonderful food,
which will be nurturing.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And people will be in a unified
high-vibrational field state.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.038 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the unicorn
and fairy version.

00:35:32.038 --> 00:35:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But that is the
all consciousness.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we say to you, Reuben,
why do you think or believe

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
or imagine humanity is
not already in this state

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.558 align:middle line:84%
of unified, well-fed
magnificence?

00:35:49.558 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do I think
they are not there?

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think, guess,
believe, or imagine,

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
have been told?

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Just give us one reason.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:36:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My perception of walking into
the supermarket and seeing it.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> So there it is.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing you have to
dissolve is your perception.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My perception of what
I see in the supermarket.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Just your perception.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Just stop with the perception.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Dissolve the framework
of perception.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So we said this a
little bit earlier.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Your mind wants to keep you
away from the grids that

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:90%
create creation.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But it wants to go
into the supermarket.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:90%
It's your perception.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
That is the framework
you want to dissolves.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I think I get it.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's tricky.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the tricky mind
that makes it tricky.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> So in this case, to--

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I choose to
dissolve perception.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Perception--

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.332 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a big pill to
swallow because everything

00:36:46.332 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:90%
in our reality is perception.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's unlikely that you--
there is so much consciousness

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.790 align:middle line:90%
in the framework of perception.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you say,
everything in your reality is--

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.320 align:middle line:84%
not everything, but how you
engage with your reality

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:90%
is perception.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's masses
of amounts of energy

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
for you personally and also
in the collective experience

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that is engaged in this
concept of perception.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The whole history of
humanity is engaged

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:90%
in this concept of perception.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Your whole
understanding of reality

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:84%
is engaged in this
concept of perception.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If you right now say,
perception be gone now,

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
it's unlikely that
that choice point

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.180 align:middle line:84%
would be enough to dissolve
all of the energy that's

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:90%
in the framework of perception.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So your whole experience of
what perception gives you--

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.728 align:middle line:84%
it's doubtful it would
disappear straight away

00:37:50.728 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and that you would
come straight away

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:90%
into the all consciousness.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And so we're--

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we don't
have perceptions.

00:37:55.792 --> 00:37:57.365 align:middle line:90%
>> --stepping stones to that.

00:37:57.365 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And a big part of this journey--

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, we would still say,
work on dissolving perception.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood, yeah.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But I guess my first step
to that, what I think--

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:84%
this direction where
I'm going, leading up

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to this now moment where we're
having this conversation,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is changing the story.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'm
getting is like,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:90%
lose the story completely.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
grids of creation

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.770 align:middle line:84%
because you were
not even that aware

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that you could go that deep
and work on that framework.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I was always focused
on changing the story.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Now just get rid of the story.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Get rid of the grids
that create creation.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
So think about it.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this what like Jesus
and Buddha did to manifest

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.630 align:middle line:84%
their wine and
water and all that?

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed, yes.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
You dissolve the frameworks
that create the matrix itself.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
You focus there because
then all the stories

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that sit on top of that that are
emanations from that can then

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
dissolve.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't really had
to engage that much in it.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But let us engage
a little bit more

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
because we straightaway went
to one of the major frameworks,

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
perception.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, perception.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going to just
ask you that question again.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Reuben, why do you think,
believe, imagine, or guess

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.850 align:middle line:84%
humanity is not already in this
state of unified joy and bliss

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:90%
and food for all and abundance?

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
censor yourself either.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to-- it
doesn't have to be big, just

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
comes to your head.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, it just
comes to perception.

00:39:37.187 --> 00:39:38.145 align:middle line:90%
There is a knowingness.

00:39:38.145 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the perception, what
comes up in the perception

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:90%
as being an issue?

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before the perception
moment came, I dropped in.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was the
knowing that it's OK.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a knowing that there's
the direct-- the spiral.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I know this is my core.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.595 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're
moving this direction.

00:39:56.595 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But we want to go with your
mind, not with your thing.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.423 align:middle line:84%
>> So the knowingness
came first.

00:40:00.423 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing--
well, why isn't it

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.548 align:middle line:84%
happening right
now in this second?

00:40:03.548 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So here's the next one--

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:90%
the illusion of time.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The illusion of time.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Dissolve the
illusion of time.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Work on dissolving
the illusion of time.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.815 align:middle line:84%
Because yeah, the now
and the second is--

00:40:11.815 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
again then goes
to the perception

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:84%
because my perception is
caught in an illusion of time

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:90%
that I perceive now.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That is a grid that
creates creation.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the major frameworks
that is building your reality,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So then we'll ask you again.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.105 align:middle line:84%
And when we ask you
these things, you don't--

00:40:30.105 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're not saying
you're doing this.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.063 align:middle line:90%
But people might go, oh my gosh.

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I have to go for the
biggest, deepest thing.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't even want you
to do that because we

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:45.140 align:middle line:84%
want to help you find the charge
of the frameworks in where

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:90%
they're sort of hiding.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to ask you again.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Inner truth.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Reuben, why do
you think, believe,

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:84%
or imagine or guess humanity
is not already in the state

00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of beautiful, unified,
abundant unicorn wonderfulness?

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the attachment
of the story.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Attachment of the story, yes.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Attachment of the old story.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> So story is part of a thing.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Go again.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Just go with even
something more practical.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And you can go to Monsanto.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was just thinking of
all the wars and the famines

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and these things on our planet.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wars, wonderful.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:26.605 align:middle line:84%
So war is a big part of that
primitive mind zeitgeist

00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking to--
or Georgia has been talking to.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And we talk through
Georgia about it a lot.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
You as humanity generally
believe in survival.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:90%
What is survival?

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Survival is to not die.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:90%
What is dying?

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.635 align:middle line:90%
It's existing or not existing.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Existing or not existing
is an illusion of the mind,

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:90%
of the human mind.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's one of those polarities.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But you can just work
with the framework of war.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You can just work with
the framework of famine

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
energy in these frameworks.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They are big parts of the
collective experience.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Many of your people who
will come to this hearing

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:84%
here will have already done
a lot of personal work.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They will have done a
lot of self-exploration.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.480 align:middle line:84%
They will have, perhaps, looked
at their own abundance issues

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:84%
as it related to their family
upbringing or this, that,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.190 align:middle line:90%
or the other.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So really, they're moving
more towards initiation

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:84%
into their all
consciousness, which

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize that as
all consciousness, Reuben,

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.470 align:middle line:90%
you have created all wars.

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:90%
You have created all famine.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:90%
You have created all injustice.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You have created all
domination, control

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of resources, all
of those things

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that might feed into a
storyline that might now

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.310 align:middle line:90%
appear as Monsanto or the GMOs.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:90%
You have created all poison.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:84%
You have created
all destruction.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you now as
all consciousness

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
want to return reality to
a state of unified field,

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.660 align:middle line:84%
you must reclaim the
energy in these frameworks,

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
including in the
framework of perception

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:90%
and of time and space.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:90%
You've created all of this.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And the limited egoic
mind will want to say,

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Reuben, don't take
all of that on.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't take all-- you're taking
on other people's energy,

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.520 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Some people will think that.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to move
into all consciousness,

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:84%
resonate at a
frequency such as you

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.830 align:middle line:84%
perceive reality in this
beautiful state of union,

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:54.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to reclaim
and purify all the energy that

00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is still invested in
those manifestations that

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:90%
resist that stage.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:10%
Because what is manifest as
you think about the world?

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.800 align:middle line:10%
You know there
are wars going on.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.750 align:middle line:10%
War is manifest because you know
that there are wars going on.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is going back to
the chicken before the egg thing

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:90%
or the smiling in the mirror.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So the next level is
a knowing or knowing

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that wars aren't going on.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But do you
really believe that?

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Obviously not.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So war is manifest.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.020 align:middle line:84%
You have a stronger
knowingness that wars

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.978 align:middle line:90%
are going on than not going on.

00:44:37.978 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:90%
But here's how to work with it.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Reclaim the energy of it.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Imagine all-- and we can take
you through that work if you

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:10%
want--

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:52.167 align:middle line:10%
is that you just imagine
all the energy if you see it

00:44:52.167 --> 00:44:53.250 align:middle line:10%
in your all consciousness.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:10%
And this is a big step
to go, all right, yeah,

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:10%
I've created all of it.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:84%
If I know those wars are going
on, if I know war has happened,

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I have created this.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But sitting in
the power of this,

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I can now reclaim all the energy
that is in all this creation

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.460 align:middle line:84%
in through the heart and bring
it through a purification

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.240 align:middle line:84%
process that I now, seated
in the all consciousness,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I acknowledge
that all of this is happening--

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:90%
but it is my energy.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It is my energy that
has created all of this.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:10%
There can be no denial of
this because then you're

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:10%
in resistance.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.720 align:middle line:10%
When you're in
nonresistance to this,

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.490 align:middle line:10%
you can reclaim all the energy.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.800 align:middle line:10%
You can purify all that energy.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And through the power of
your conscious intention

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.440 align:middle line:10%
and creative focus,
as all consciousness,

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:10%
you can now choose to put
that energy to something else,

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.630 align:middle line:10%
to put it to the unified
field, if that's what you want,

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:10%
to put it to this
state of beingness

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.230 align:middle line:10%
where all that is in
everything is living

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:10%
at least in the harmonic state.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not everybody's
doing the same.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.740 align:middle line:10%
But they are living in
joyful abundance and creation

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.610 align:middle line:10%
this way.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:10%
This is your power.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But you have to to
manifest on this level,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to bend the matrix on this level
because every little story is

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.660 align:middle line:84%
fed by the big matrix
that you have created.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And if your egoic
consciousness won't even

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:10%
let you get to the
big frameworks,

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.300 align:middle line:10%
you're going to stay
in the battles here

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.320 align:middle line:10%
of the small frame,
of the storylines.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And you just go, all
right, I've created it all.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.713 align:middle line:90%
I've created it all.

00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It might not even feel that
good to acknowledge that.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.610 align:middle line:10%
But with love and
acceptance, you

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.680 align:middle line:10%
are loving and accepting
the part of you

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.030 align:middle line:10%
that has created all of this.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.947 align:middle line:10%
And you bring it all
back in and go, oh, yeah,

00:46:49.947 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:10%
I created all of this.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.230 align:middle line:90%
But I am a powerful creator.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.730 align:middle line:84%
If I created all of this,
I can create differently.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:10%
If I created the
story of perception

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.970 align:middle line:10%
that keeps people in
limitation and suffering,

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:10%
I can go, well, I'll just
pull all the energy that's

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.700 align:middle line:10%
in that framework of perception,
bring it in, and purify it.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a massive
amount of energy

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I have now to create
something different.

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Love and acceptance.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed, dear one.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And we want to acknowledge
that of course this

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.140 align:middle line:84%
is not easy because you
as all consciousness also

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.100 align:middle line:84%
created a wonderfully
powerful ego to resist

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.520 align:middle line:90%
all of this stuff.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But this is why you also
don't resist your ego,

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.260 align:middle line:90%
the fact that you have one.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You love and accept all
aspects of your consciousness

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.250 align:middle line:84%
that is projected through the
ego construct, which includes--

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:90%
we are sorry to say, dear one--

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So can you walk me
through some tools

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.400 align:middle line:90%
to love and accept Monsanto?

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we do that?

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
what is Monsanto?

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto just has a
lot of meaning for you.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it's wonderful because you've
manifested this single point,

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.540 align:middle line:84%
quote unquote, "bad guy" that
you can focus your energy on.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But here's where
everybody gets caught

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
because you're clever enough to
make, quote unquote, "enemies."

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But your mind is
also clever enough

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to keep you in the
story of the enemy.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The enemy is a vessel
of a lot of energy.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
charge in there.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
consciousness in that enemy.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.830 align:middle line:10%
So what's the fun part
about having stories?

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:90%
They are like a shining light.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's a giant ball
of energy, of power,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
that you can access

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.893 align:middle line:90%
if you stop resisting it.

00:48:51.893 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm just thinking of--

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Be a charge hunter.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So thinking of the greatest
villains in our movies,

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in our "Avengers"
movies, and Thanos--

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:00.364 --> 00:49:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Why are people so drawn
to these archetypes?

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.205 align:middle line:84%
>> They're like, oh,
this great being--

00:49:03.205 --> 00:49:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and he wants all this
power and all this stuff.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, full of energy.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So we're creating that.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.593 align:middle line:90%
>> We're creating the Thanos.

00:49:11.593 --> 00:49:12.760 align:middle line:90%
We're creating the Monsanto.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>> And how do we uncreate that?

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So I think--
yes, it's tricky.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:19.720 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.012 align:middle line:10%
So it's not really that tricky.

00:49:21.012 --> 00:49:22.080 align:middle line:10%
But in the intention--

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.243 align:middle line:10%
>> About hitting in the face
and more wars and that kind

00:49:24.243 --> 00:49:24.385 align:middle line:10%
of thing.

00:49:24.385 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:25.165 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:49:25.165 --> 00:49:25.965 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:25.965 --> 00:49:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So you just go, wow, it's a
big, beautiful ball of energy.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.940 align:middle line:90%
This is my energy.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
This is my consciousness
that I have

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.860 align:middle line:84%
formed, this
wonderful enemy that

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is embodying so many archetypes
that I am now wanting

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:90%
to uncreate on the planet.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.560 align:middle line:90%
I focused it all here.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.860 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I've made a shortcut.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto means war.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It means famine.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.700 align:middle line:90%
It means deprivation.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It means poison.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It means disease.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.440 align:middle line:10%
It means sickness.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:10%
Wow, this is wonderful.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.350 align:middle line:10%
I've put them all in one spot.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But wonderful-- here is
Monsanto, the embodiment

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of all of the energy
that is being engaged

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:84%
in these massively archetypal
stories of humanity

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:90%
throughout all consciousness.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And all I have to do is
bring the energy of Monsanto

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
into my heart and
love and accept

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the part of me that is
all aspects of Monsanto

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and all of the storylines that
Monsanto is creating within me,

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:41.340 align:middle line:84%
all of the creation of
Monsanto, all humanity,

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and all consciousness.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.770 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know we use
the infinity eight tool

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to run that ball of energy
that is Monsanto and everything

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.040 align:middle line:84%
it means-- you can just
pull it all into your heart

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and begin to run
that ball of energy

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:84%
from the heart center up around
through an infinity eight

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.130 align:middle line:90%
through the thymus.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.480 align:middle line:90%
What is the thymus?

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:13.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the seat of your all
consciousness heart center.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.510 align:middle line:84%
This is your heart center of
you as creator of everything.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very powerful
place of purification.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:26.570 align:middle line:84%
The heart center here
is sort of like your--

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.590 align:middle line:84%
we don't even want to say your
single egoic heart center.

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It is your multidimensional
heart center.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the heart of you as Reuben
and all your incarnations.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is the heart
center of all consciousness,

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.000 align:middle line:90%
your whole consciousness.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So you just imagine
bringing that ball of energy

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.960 align:middle line:84%
into your heart, whatever it
is for whoever's-- everybody's

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Thanoses out there,
everybody's villains,

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:55.430 align:middle line:84%
everybody's-- because
your Monsanto is somebody

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.500 align:middle line:90%
else's heaven point.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.060 align:middle line:90%
But their Thanos may be--

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.588 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.588 --> 00:52:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The hippies in Hawaii.

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The hippies in Hawaii.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Destroying the planet.

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Destroying farming,
destroying the culture

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
of my family's upbringing,
the heritage of our food,

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:21.050 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, or how the owner
of Monsanto is going to feed

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.720 align:middle line:84%
all his children
and grandchildren

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and their children.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in their mind, it could
be this wonderful corporation.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We're making millions of
dollars and feeding generations

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.233 align:middle line:90%
of my family and their families.

00:52:34.233 --> 00:52:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm donating money
to charity, whatever.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We're just showing that
the perception will change.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Perception-- this is why it's
good to take perception down.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's bring
perception in as well.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So this perception, Monsanto,
bringing all that energy

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:53.450 align:middle line:84%
into your heart, and running
it through the infinity eight,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and we can--

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.020 align:middle line:84%
we won't do the
full purification.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But you can just invite all
the energy that is creating--

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And is the infinity eight
going through the chakras going

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:03.960 align:middle line:90%
up?

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going from
the heart center

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart around the
top and through here?

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> No, from the heart to the
all consciousness heart center.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, just right here.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:10.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Just in here.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like this, yes.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.540 align:middle line:90%
That's one way you can use it.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.872 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking this
big loop because I've--

00:53:16.872 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> You could do a big loop.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.655 align:middle line:84%
>> --done ankhing, which is
through the top and through

00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:90%
the heart and around.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You're welcome to do that
because if that's how it starts

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.630 align:middle line:84%
evolving for you, that's how
your purification is running.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's fine.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You can also use the--
and the infinity eight--

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:45.570 align:middle line:84%
again, it's a tool that is
created because there is this--

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the continuity of
energy is there.

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be destroyed.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be created.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is just a purification
that's happening there.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's containing the energy as
it's purifying the form of it.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And what creates the
form is energy, too.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So if it gets
really big, you just

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:84%
might be using a
lot of energy there.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can just imagine
that creation, everything

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that is archetypal for it, all
its meanings, associations,

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:22.740 align:middle line:84%
attachments, future projections,
past memories, everything

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that's feeding
into this boogeyman

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:32.060 align:middle line:84%
is being dissolved
away on a personal

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and genetic and hereditary
and family and communal

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and planetary and
universal level.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you could as easily,
yes, project this story,

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.240 align:middle line:84%
all of those stories-- war,
famine, starvation, poison,

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.040 align:middle line:90%
disease--

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.042 align:middle line:84%
out into the
galactic realms, out

00:54:49.042 --> 00:54:50.250 align:middle line:90%
into the all-universal realm.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So in the galactic sense,
we hear about the Orion wars

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and these other--

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.780 align:middle line:90%
where humanity is seeded from.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's this-- yeah, like
"Star Wars" is a real thing.

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.950 align:middle line:90%
You hear all these stories.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Or it was a real
thing in the past.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.907 align:middle line:84%
And we've got remnants of that
that we're trying to clear

00:55:06.907 --> 00:55:07.740 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, it is tricky because
the human egoic construct

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.910 align:middle line:84%
operates very well in
the story framework.

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It can't help project
that out throughout all

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.245 align:middle line:90%
of its perception of creation.

00:55:25.245 --> 00:55:29.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But human egoic
creation is seeded

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.640 align:middle line:84%
from the all consciousness,
which contains everything.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the chicken
and the egg is still there.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.810 align:middle line:10%
So everything that
feeds archetypes--

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:51.550 align:middle line:10%
so the archetype of war, whether
it is the war in the body,

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:10%
something like fighting cancer,
to the war with Monsanto,

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.830 align:middle line:10%
to the war between
different countries,

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:04.790 align:middle line:10%
to the galactic wars--

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:09.870 align:middle line:10%
is going through the
human egoic framework.

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But the human egoic
framework also

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.330 align:middle line:84%
comes from all consciousness,
from everything.

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.800 align:middle line:90%
So where did that come from?

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Where did this idea
that war could exist--

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.640 align:middle line:84%
well, it came from the
all consciousness, too.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.665 align:middle line:10%
And that's why
there is a strong--

00:56:25.665 --> 00:56:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:10%
we want to find the right word--

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:41.490 align:middle line:10%
synergy between what you project
out into the all consciousness

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:10%
and whether it is
real or not from--

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.240 align:middle line:10%
that it comes from the
all consciousness to seed

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.920 align:middle line:10%
human consciousness.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Did the Orion wars happen?

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a projection from
the human consciousnesses.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But the consciousness of
war is in all consciousness.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So if Orion exists, there are
aspects of that creation where

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.650 align:middle line:90%
war could be seeded in there.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And humans like to
compartmentalize and put things

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:18.262 align:middle line:84%
in neat, tidy sections so
it's easier to deal with.

00:57:18.262 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's easy to deal with.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Like you said, Monsanto--

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.050 align:middle line:90%
it's just easy.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's just deal with Monsanto.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.550 align:middle line:90%
We can deal with it all.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But see, the difference
between-- now Monsanto.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So you purify all the
energy of Monsanto

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and everything
that means to you.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.065 align:middle line:84%
And then Reuben
donates $50 to the--

00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Organic farming?

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:47.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, to the lawyers fighting
Monsanto, let's just say.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, the frequency of
that $50 in Reuben's world

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.060 align:middle line:10%
is already containing
that unification process,

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.850 align:middle line:10%
that dissolving of all the
frameworks that Monsanto meant.

00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It may have a much
bigger effect than if you

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't bother to
integrate Monsanto

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in the first place
in Reuben's reality.

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.032 align:middle line:84%
So still, because
that physical action

00:58:08.032 --> 00:58:09.240 align:middle line:90%
still carries the frequency--

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.032 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll still take
physical actions, yes.

00:58:11.032 --> 00:58:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It takes the frequencies
of unification.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever that is, it's going
to take the frequency of what I

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.040 align:middle line:90%
put into it.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But if it's coming from
a place of fighting,

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:35.960 align:middle line:84%
the dismantling of Monsanto
is creating more friction.

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you probably--

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:84%
once you've really purified
Monsanto and everything

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.950 align:middle line:84%
it means, you're not going to
feel the same way about it.

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I would even
donate $50 to lawyers.

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:48.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking.

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:50.630 align:middle line:84%
You might not even
take that action.

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:52.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Even right now, I'm
like, I understand--

00:58:52.602 --> 00:58:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get rid of
lawyers on the planet.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.825 align:middle line:84%
So I don't even want to
feed the lawyers anything.

00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:56.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:56.995 --> 00:58:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And what do lawyers mean to you?

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Conflict.

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:09.280 align:middle line:84%
They are a-- why
do we need lawyers?

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Because people can't figure
things out for themselves.

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.130 align:middle line:84%
They give their power
to someone else.

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So again, so you want--

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:22.630 align:middle line:84%
so what would it mean
to you that there were

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:25.098 align:middle line:90%
no lawyers on the planet left?

00:59:25.098 --> 00:59:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Why is that a good thing?

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:30.560 align:middle line:10%
>> What it means to me is--

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.370 align:middle line:10%
yeah, because there's
a level of trust

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:36.570 align:middle line:10%
that then can be created through
the individual experiences.

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So trust, yes.

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think,
believe, imagine,

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:43.450 align:middle line:84%
or guess that
trust doesn't exist

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:45.587 align:middle line:90%
on the planet in this way?

00:59:45.587 --> 00:59:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the number
of lawyers on the planet.

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:49.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:53.136 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
damn many of them.

00:59:53.136 --> 00:59:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So that obviously means
there's not enough trust.

00:59:57.390 --> 01:00:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can certainly
purify the energy of lawyers.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I need to do that, probably.

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a private
session on just lawyers.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing
about lawsuits,

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of course, because
they do very much--

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:19.980 align:middle line:84%
particularly when you're talking
about two sides fighting,

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.040 align:middle line:84%
which is a different
energy from how

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.508 align:middle line:90%
criminal law might be working.

01:00:24.508 --> 01:00:26.675 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about when
there's conflict between--

01:00:26.675 --> 01:00:27.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Two sides, yeah.

01:00:27.475 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --two sides fighting.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're
back at conflict.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We're back at resistors.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
We're back at war.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.360 align:middle line:90%
We're back at polarity.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
We're back at a lot
of these major themes.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.745 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.745 --> 01:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a general,
broad spectrum with lawyers

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and seeded in this
planet, you can just

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
work with all of that
on a planetary template.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But say you have two people,
a couple of neighbors

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
who are fighting in a lawsuit.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.850 align:middle line:10%
The charge of that lawsuit--

01:00:56.850 --> 01:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
and we all see how lawsuits
go on and on and on and on.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been part
of it myself, yeah.

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the charge
is still there.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.400 align:middle line:90%
The charge is still there.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And very often, lawsuits
begin to resolve

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
when the process of the two
individuals just sort of

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:18.440 align:middle line:90%
get so--

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
work through whatever it is.

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, say, if there's a
family fighting over a will,

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:31.280 align:middle line:84%
well, the will really is about
the meanings of those things.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the
journey of the fight

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
usually may make an
individual have to resolve

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.300 align:middle line:90%
the meanings of those things.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.600 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was the meaning
of, did that person who died

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.820 align:middle line:10%
love me or love
them more than me?

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.040 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what we're saying?

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So the psychological
journey, the resolution

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of that-- then usually you see
the resolution of the lawsuit

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
happen when it's become
more meaningless.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.145 align:middle line:84%
So you give Monsanto
a lot of meaning.

01:02:00.145 --> 01:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you do
the purification,

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.040 align:middle line:90%
it will become more meaningless.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then things that you want
to see will become manifest.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Part of my tools--

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is maybe
the long way around.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't empower lawyers
by not using them and not

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
having that.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But you still have a
lot of charge around them.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're suppressing
something in that.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's we say.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You're actually putting
power in the suppression.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.010 align:middle line:90%
So be honest.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.093 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're saying.

01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Be honest about what's
got you fired up.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Because already, if you're
authentic and honest,

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
you're in the state
of nonresistance.

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.752 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably going
to be a private session.

01:02:38.752 --> 01:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
-- about getting to
that lawyer thing.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a big one for a
lot of people, a lot of people.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we're really
talking about the power

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and the
power to move the matrix

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and the power to move the
bigger collective reality,

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
which is where you're
focusing a lot of the time--

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
just wanting to do this.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And you are driven by
the desire to change

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:04.070 align:middle line:90%
the collective reality.

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, staying in
the smaller stories

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to help
you harvest and harness

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
enough energy for you
to change the bigger,

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.470 align:middle line:90%
broader, collective reality.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people just want to
change their personal reality.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's totally fine.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They might just have
to go, oh my gosh.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the grief that
my mother didn't love me

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
as much as I needed.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm allowing myself
to feel that pain

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and love and accept the part
of me that felt that grief

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and then come to some
neutrality there.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Then that storyline can shift.

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who are drawn
to big corporate-- big stories,

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
political stories,
social stories.

01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
They are planetary healers.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're wanting to shift the
paradigm of the whole planet.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're going for the
big, juicy, hot-topic, fiery

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
stories-- because
lots of energy there.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But even then, the latest
downloads I've been getting

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
is to focus on this,
this conversation.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.307 align:middle line:84%
Part of me wants to go and
talk about the political scene

01:04:07.307 --> 01:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and Monsanto and all that stuff.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.057 align:middle line:84%
>> But recognize that you've
drawn to it because it's full

01:04:11.057 --> 01:04:11.858 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

01:04:11.858 --> 01:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what your story is.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge yourself.

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, no.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.145 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely drawn to it.

01:04:16.145 --> 01:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But then my higher
guidance is telling me

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.190 align:middle line:90%
this is the meaning right here.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:23.475 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the meaning.

01:04:23.475 --> 01:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
you might not still

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.075 align:middle line:90%
be drawn to the story.

01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I still have my
coffee with the story.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:28.435 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

01:04:28.435 --> 01:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It's great entertainment.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.892 align:middle line:84%
But I don't need to
project that out there.

01:04:30.892 --> 01:04:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>> But be a fan.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, frequency [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And really what that
is-- it's a little bit out

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.660 align:middle line:90%
of context in this thing.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.557 align:middle line:84%
If a story has got
a lot of charge,

01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
it just means there's
a lot of energy there.

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't resist it.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.810 align:middle line:84%
If your mind is going
there, go there.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Even if you-- what
your higher self is

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to say to
you-- if you go there,

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.210 align:middle line:90%
don't focus on the story.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Just harvest the energy.

01:04:58.810 --> 01:04:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Harvest the energy.

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's OK.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
We want people to
understand this

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
because you may be here to have
incarnated to heal and uplift

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
this part of humanity's
consciousness.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we talked about
with the planetary templates.

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.623 align:middle line:84%
If you are really being drawn
to something, and you're like,

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't do that because
I should be not focusing

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
on the story and should be in
my higher consciousness, that

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.700 align:middle line:90%
may have created resistance.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're drawn to it
because that is energy that you

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
are here to integrate and
bring back into the all

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:32.870 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
That's your "job,"
quote unquote.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
So go there.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Just get the energy.

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Bring it back.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Purify.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's that
teeter totter--

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Recreate.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --just going in enough to get
the energy and then coming back

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and not wallowing in it.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And not wallowing in it.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And wallowing is an
interesting thing

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
because wallowing can actually
just be being with it.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And being can be, for some
people, the first state

01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of nonresistance to
it, allowing yourself

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.610 align:middle line:90%
to feel the energy of it.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at Monsanto
and getting all fired up

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and feeling some anger and
stuff like that, it's all right.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That anger is
energy and allowing

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:14.070 align:middle line:90%
yourself to feel the energy.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
But here's the trick.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I am not good or bad
for feeling angry.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not right or wrong
for feeling this anger.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
This anger is energy.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
This is my energy.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.070 align:middle line:90%
This is my power.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it really
simple for people.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm so angry about this.

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm so stressed out.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Witness-- oh, hello.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I am in a story.

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:37.910 align:middle line:90%
What does the story mean?

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.210 align:middle line:90%
There is charge there.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to go and get it.

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring
it in my heart.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to purify it.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to invite
the broader part of me that

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
can assist the more
rapid purification

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.980 align:middle line:90%
to come in and help me with it.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Another big step
is the surrender.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Reuben, where you are
sitting right now,

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
you don't know how to fix
or heal or change or make

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
better all of this stuff,
everything that Monsanto means

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever any of
these things mean.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, lawyers.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So now you also surrender.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And you give it over to the
bigger part of you that does.

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't actually have to
understand all of this stuff

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.430 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we'll give
it really simply to you

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.820 align:middle line:90%
once again, dear ones.

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll do it straight
to the camera for you.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Dear ones, first of all,
your mind is very active.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very stressed out.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You're in some
pain or something.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Ah, identify-- I am
engaged in a story.

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would have two choices
here-- to get into the story

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and stay lost in the story or
to go, ah, a big, hot story

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.310 align:middle line:90%
means a lot of energy.

01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting into the mind
drama and staying in the story,

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring the energy
of that story into my heart.

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to love and
accept the part of me that

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
created this story and
everything that is in it.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm going to surrender.

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving this story over
to the bigger part of me that

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:11.780 align:middle line:84%
knows how to uncreate
this because you

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.790 align:middle line:90%
are innately all consciousness.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You are innately connected
to the intelligence

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
that created the whole story.

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And that part of
you already knows

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:25.939 align:middle line:84%
how to untangle it and return
the energy that is into it back

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
to pure creative
force for you to now

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.150 align:middle line:84%
create with, either
consciously or to just give it

01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to your heart and, say, hey,
big part of me that is already

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.510 align:middle line:84%
pretty great at this creating,
create something wonderful

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:middle line:90%
for me.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And that actually feels
really good to not have that

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
heavy burden of, I
got to figure it out.

01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
I got to do this.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:50.060 align:middle line:90%
You can kind of--

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
there's other versions of
you that can handle this.

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.577 align:middle line:84%
You are the intelligence
that created all of it.

01:08:56.577 --> 01:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we can
just have fun here.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.922 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you
can have fun here.

01:08:59.922 --> 01:09:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is really the point.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, play in Hawaii and--

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Play in Hawaii.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> --go on these
amazing adventure.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this is happening
all the time unconsciously

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.399 align:middle line:84%
for you anyway every time
you're like, whatever.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But for those big,
juicy stories that

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of charge and
that are really meaty, yes.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
You as someone who incarnated
to assist the evolutionary shift

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness have
perhaps created an intention

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to releasing
the charge of that story.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you're drawn to it.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's, again, why we
don't want you to be like,

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.539 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're being naughty,
and you're in your story.

01:09:41.539 --> 01:09:43.539 align:middle line:84%
You're just like, I'm
really drawn to the story.

01:09:43.539 --> 01:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This must be part of what
I said I would purify.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So this consciousness
can move to my unicorn,

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
interconnected magnificence
and state of being.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, spaceships
and intergalactic--

01:09:59.140 --> 01:09:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Spaceship, whatever you want.

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --communications with
higher intelligent beings.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does
that mean to you?

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun, yes.

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I--

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy it.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I started this
show-- because I'm just so drawn

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.447 align:middle line:84%
to that perception
of flying around

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:18.530 align:middle line:90%
the galaxy in a spaceship.

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's other
people who think unicorns--

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's already happening.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --and other things are cool.

01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think spaceships are
way cooler than unicorns.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, unicorn people.

01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:30.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Nothing against unicorns.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.463 align:middle line:90%
I love unicorns, too.

01:10:32.463 --> 01:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's already happening
in your consciousness.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You can do it multidimensionally
through accessing mind states

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.710 align:middle line:90%
where you can experience it.

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
coming more and more

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
into your physicalized
visceral reality.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It is becoming manifest.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It becomes manifest
through being

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
able to give energy
from these old stories

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:58.040 align:middle line:90%
to the new creations.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
purification is for.

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:02.030 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we covered a
lot of ground today.

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, dear one.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And lovely as always to talk
with the Circle through Georgia

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Jean here.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Any last moments of words,
anything from the collective

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.980 align:middle line:90%
to--

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to more
than just me right now.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, just come to
the heart, dear ones.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Come to the heart.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything can be solved
here in the heart.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It is your gateway to
nonpolarity, nonstory.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
If there's something in your
heart that is causing you pain,

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
love and accept it.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It will dissipate in form
and come back to energy

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.930 align:middle line:90%
for you to create with.

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But this really is the
ultimate cheat code.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We adore you all so very much
until we're meeting in this way

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.973 align:middle line:90%
or some other way.

01:11:56.973 --> 01:11:57.890 align:middle line:90%
We love you very much.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And for now, we'll say
goodbye to you all.

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:10.600 align:middle line:90%


01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:13:17.000 align:middle line:90%
